Meanwhile Jodie owns a swanky apartment and gets a hefty allowance from her parents which she says runs into the ‘thousands’.5Star’s social experiment Rich Kids Go Skint saw Jodie move in with Becky and live her life on the breadline, as well as muck in with housework and doing the school run.It was a far cry from the world Jodie is used to, as she and Becky and her kids had to get by on a £3-a-day budget.Becky Wilson is a single mum who lives in a one-bedroom flat with her two kids (Picture: Channel 5)The other ‘rich kids’ who have taken part in the show seem to have learnt from their experience, but Jodie says she ‘didn’t sympathise too much’ with the struggling mum.‘It just kind of felt like she wasn’t utilising her opportunities enough. She’s a nice girl I just feel like she keeps making bad decisions,’ she told The Sun.She added that the amount of stuff Becky has in her flat could ‘make at least £500’.Jodie said: ‘She was a hoarder so even though there was a spare room in the flat, there wasn’t even space for me to stay over in the flat because she was hoarding so much stuff.‘She had a spare room that could easily have been another bedroom or a playroom for the kids.’Jodie also felt that sending her kids to a school three bus journeys away was something else she disagreed with, as it means she has to stay in the area until they come out of school so she can take them home.‘She just has a coffee with one of her friends. That again is another one of her bad decision I feel’.Surprisingly, Jodie said she had never traveled by bus until filming for the show, preferring to take Ubers everywhere.The beauty salon owner struggled to work out how to even board the bus.They parted on good terms, but Jodie did find the experiment ‘draining’, adding: ‘Thank God I am on my way home now and I’m not looking back.’Viewers were recently outraged by last week’s episode when rich kid Angelina initially refused to stay with her host Amy, declaring she had booked herself into a nearby hotel.Rich Kids Go Skint airs Wednesdays at 9pm on 5Star.MORE: ‘Rich kid’ who swapped life with ‘skint’ family for TV show surprises by not being spoiledMORE: Mum stunned as rich kid reveals £8k watch worth six months of her salary: ‘That’s a lot of money to tell the time!’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sei_11583673.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"man jumped off asda roof remains critical condition","story":"The man is in a critical condition in hospital (Picture: Kent 999sTwitter)The man who fell from the roof of an Asda in south east London is critically injured in hospital.Scotland Yard said the man, aged in his late 30s, was taken to hospital by air ambulance and remains in a critical condition on Saturday morning.He climbed to the top of the building in the Broadway, Bexleyheath, and fell from the height at about 11am on Friday, following a brief standoff with police.The supermarket worker said: ‘He was really determined because it’s not easy to get up there.Police, paramedics, a fire crew and the air ambulance were called to the scene (Picture: Kent 999)‘He climbed onto a net that we use to keep pigeons away and almost fell through it then.’They added: ‘From what I heard, the man was upset – something to do with the NHS murdering his baby.’Eyewitnesses also claimed the man’s father was outside the supermarket and attempting to talk his son down.A London Ambulance Service spokesperson said: ‘We were called 11.00am to Broadway, Bexleyheath, to reports of an incident.‘We sent an incident response officer and two ambulance crews.

In case anyone had forgotten, this is the same Chris Brown who plead guilty to beating his then girlfriend, Rihanna, until she bled and even tried to bite a chunk out of her ear.The response to those tweets?A sea of people telling me to ‘chill out’ and ‘get over it.’Apparently being angry about violent assault against women is petty if the assault happened more than a few years ago.Last month Piers Morgan announced that he’d been in conversation with Harvey Weinstein and that they both thought Harvey would soon be rehabilitated.I think he’s right.(Picture: Ella Byworth)I’m accepting the harsh reality that Weinstein will probably be rehabilitated. It’ll take lots of apologising, some therapy, a chat about sex addiction and even then he’ll probably be kept behind the scenes.But I firmly believe that he will work again. For all the awful things he’s accused of doing, he’s also talented. He makes money. And what do people care about more than morality? Money.If you’re still hoping that Harvey might never make his way back, that the way he treated the women around him would be bad enough to condemn him for life, you are, I believe, out of luck. Because whatever a man does, no matter how violent or abusive or horrific his crimes, it seems that he can be forgiven, that the world can move on.Johnny Depp was accused of physically assaulting Amber Heard during their marriage. The actors settled the orce case and the domestic abuse case, but, while Amber was accused of being a ‘golddigger’ (despite donating her orce settlement to charity), Johnny has already been accepted back into the film industry without question.He’s in children’s films – Sherlock Gnomes and Fantastic Beasts. He’s still the face of Savage for Dior.What about Mel Gibson. He was violent and used hideous antisemitic slurs. That’s got to put you on the bench for the rest of your career, right?Nope. It might have taken a few years, but Mel is working again. Because, well he might be violent and hateful, but you saw how good he was in Braveheart, right?(Picture: Ella ByworthGetty Images)It’s different for women.There aren’t many famous women who have blotted their copy books quite so comprehensively as their male co-stars, but let’s take the example of Hollywood’s darling, Winona Ryder.Winona was everyone’s favourite. She could open a film on her own name alone. Then, she shoplifted – she didn’t hurt anyone, use racial slurs or leave anyone bleeding. She stole.Her career ground to a humiliating halt for over a decade. She took a full hiatus for half of the noughties.Now compare that to Woody Allen who cheated on his wife with his adopted daughter, 35 years his junior, and then married her. His daughter Dylan publicly accused him of sexual abuse which allegedly took place throughout her childhood.And yet, he was only thrown out of the Academy last week.Roman Polanski, the film director who was arrested for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl – who fled back to Paris on hearing he was going to be sentenced to prison – still wins awards. He still makes films. He was also only thrown out of the Academy last week. And his response? A threat to sue the Academy.So why does it matter that these men are forgiven?Tiger Woods explains how injuries have SERIOUSLY damaged his putting foreveropinionHere’s why we should all be cheering on SuRie and our UK team at EurovisionBut most importantly, there’s the message that this forgiveness sends.We have consequences for illegal and abusive behaviour, for a reason. We do it as a discouragement, because sadly people cannot be trusted to choose to be kind and respectful.Whilst it’s nice to think that people who do terrible things can say that they’re sorry, atone and move on, that’s often not the case. Just look at Roman trying to sue the Academy or Chris Brown saying he wishes everyone would stop talking about Rihanna.Even if you can atone for what you’ve done, I’m not sure you should be put back on your celebrity pedestal. Doesn’t horrific behaviour forfit the right to be glorified and famous? If you hit a child while drunk driving, you can lose your licence for life. There are certain privileges that you can – and should – lose forever.As long as we continue to forgive the kinds of men who hurt or abuse women, that discouragement just doesn’t stack up. We’re sending an ongoing message that abuse is pretty much okay, as long as you act like you’re sorry afterwards.And really, as long as we’re broadcasting that message to young men, can we be surprised that this systemic, undeniable abuse of women just keeps going on?MORE: If nobody in your house wears nappies then you really should give up baby wipes – and here’s what you should use insteadMORE: Sarah Jessica Parker admits Sex And The City would differ today – and probably have women of colour"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/bus-passenger.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"woman 22 complains man masturbating behind bus driver just tells move seats","story":"A man was caught exposing himself and masturbating in front of a young woman while on a bus in Leeds.    (Picture: News Dog Media)A man was caught exposing himself and masturbating in front of a young woman while on a bus in Leeds. Karlah Louise Daly, 22, was sitting at the front of the upper deck on the no.16 bus to Leeds City Centre yesterday when the man moved closer to her and started pleasuring himself.Shocking footage shows Karlah asking the man to stop performing the sex act yet he continues to harass her.Karlah described how she told the driver bout the incident but claims he simply asked her to sit somewhere else.In fact, the man was allowed to remain on the vehicle even after she left.When the Karlah reported him to the bus driver, he did nothing about it and simply told her to change seats (Picture: News Dog Media)The appalling incident took place on the First UK no.16 bus from Armley to Leeds City Centre around 6.20pm to 6.50pm on Thursday.As the bottom deck of the bus was full, Karlah went to take a seat by the window upstairs.Karlah had been on the bus for ten minutes when the traumatic event happened.The appalling incident took place on the First UK no.16 bus from Armley to Leeds City Centre around 6.20pm to 6.50pm on Thursday.

Clarence hasn\u0027t been used for a long time and it\u0027s been sort of tainted by bad luck.\u0027One Duke of Clarence was the eldest son of Edward VII and there have been a lot of fairly salacious stories surrounding him.\u0027Another Duke of Clarence was executed for treason and allegedly drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine.\u0027Connaught, with its links to the Republic of Ireland, might not be suitable at the moment.          Tradition dictates that royal men receive a title on the morning of their wedding – with Harry looking set to become the Duke of Sussex\u0027The dukedoms of Cumberland, Albany and Teviotdale are all suspended, meaning there could be claims to those titles.\u0027Windsor – last used by the abdicated Edward VIII – is likely to be off the table.Although it would reclaim the title for a new generation, Wallis Simpson – the last Duchess of Windsor, who sparked the abdication crisis of 1936 – was, like Meghan, an American orcee.Other options could include Avondale and Kendal.Previously used titles that are available to Prince Harry  are Connaught, Albany, Cumberland, Ross, Kintyre, Kendal, Sussex and Clarence. Connaught is now a province of the Republic of Ireland ans would be very unlikely to be used.  The Duke and Duchess of Windsor´s marriage caused difficulties for the royal family with Edward VIII abdicatingThe previous holders of the titles Albany and Cumberland lost their titles after they fought for Germany during World War I. Their heirs are also alive and hence could disrupt any claims to the title.   Ross and Kintyre have not been used in more than 500 years, and Kendal was only used once used for a baby son of King James II, who died during infancy.  However, the previous Duke of Sussex, Prince Augustus Frederick, holds a lot of parallels with Prince Harry.He was born on the January 27 1773 at Buckingham Palace, the ninth child of King George III and Queen Charlotte. He was given freedom to develop his own interests, like Prince Harry, and supported many liberal causes.          Prince Augustus Frederick, who died in 1843, was the last person to hold the \u0027Duke of Sussex\u0027 titleHe was a strong supporter of anti-slavery legislation among other causes such as electoral reform, Jewish rights and Catholic emancipation.      He died aged 70 on April 21,  1843 at Kensington Palace, where Harry and Meghan now reside. Harry – whose full name is Prince Henry of Wales – could turn down a title, but would be a surprise move. In this case, Meghan would be known as HRH Princess Henry of Wales.She is not entitled to be Princess Meghan because she is not a princess in her own right, only through marriage.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were also given titles linking them to Scotland and Northern Ireland, becoming the Earl and Countess of Strathearn and Baron and Baroness Carrickfergus, meaning Harry and Meghan might also be given multiple ones as well."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/16/4C0E4F2300000578-5713953-image-a-6_1525966456420.jpg","title":"Behind scenes footage shows Meghan Markle fits giggles set forgetting lines","story":"    Behind-the-scenes footage of Meghan Markle on the TV drama Suits shows the actress dissolving into fits of giggles, dancing around the set and fluffing her lines          Outtakes from the first six series, show the close friendship between the princess-to-be and her co-stars Patrick J Adams and Sarah Rafferty          The off-cuts of the hit series Suits, which can be found on YouTube , under the titles \u0027Blooper Reel\u0027 or \u0027Gag Reel\u0027 give a fascinating insight into Meghan\u0027s personalityWill Prince Harry shave off his beard in time for the big...The hazard of a dukedom: If Harry and Meghan really want to...Meghan and Harry bring New York to a stand still... sort of:...Share this articleBut she does not appear in as many clips as the rest of the cast, showing how seriously she took her big break in the profession.Meghan, 36, who marries Prince Harry next Saturday, joined Suits in 2011, moving from Los Angeles to Toronto.But she has now admitted that she thought she had blown her audition for the role of paralegal Rachel Zane in the show, originally entitled A Legal Mind.In an interview with listings magazine Fan The Fire, she said: \u0027It was just like any other audition.\u0027I was sent the material and was asked to go and read for the producers.

Prince Albert had projected in 2016 that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimateNow with two children of his own, he told People magazine at the time that he purchased the property that he can\u0027t wait to make new memories there with his own children, twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella.\u0027I\u0027m looking forward to showing the house to the kids, sharing it with them, having them see the garden,\u0027 he said. He projected then that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimate.          Prince Albert and his family worked from top to bottom over the past year-and-a-half to make sure the home properly conveyed the emotional and historical significance it holds for them          On the second floor, four bedrooms including the one where Princess Grace spent her younger years brought back memories for the Prince          Prince Albert gave a tour of the refinished property to the Today Show          Princess Grace Kelly is seen here on January 10, 1956, with her fiance Prince Rainier of Monaco          Prince Rainier III of Monaco and Oscar winner Grace Kelly pose for photographers at the home of Kelly\u0027s parents after the pair\u0027s engagement was announced on January 5, 1956          Prince Rainier of Monaco and film actress Grace Kelly show off the engagement ring to her mother at the home of Kelly\u0027s parents a few days after their announcement          Next to the den, there\u0027s bar which the family referred to as \u0027Kelly Tavern\u0027 Next to the den, there\u0027s a bar which the family referred to as \u0027Kelly Tavern.\u0027 An oar that is believed to have belonged to Princess Grace\u0027s father hangs today above the bar, where the point of his scull is also displayed.In addition to the restorative work, irreplaceable personal touches somehow remained throughout the residence, like the linen closet floor on the second floor that survived with etching of the Kelly children\u0027s heights clearly visible, from two years old to their late teens.          Prince Albert shows Kotb one of the irreplaceable personal touches that somehow remained throughout the residence, like the linen closet floor on the second floor          The linen closet door survived with etchings of the Kelly children\u0027s heights clearly visible, from two years old to their late teens          Though he was thankful the memories were preserved unscathed, Prince Albert couldn\u0027t really offer much of an explanation for the still-standing treasure          \u0027Maybe they thought we were going to take it back one day,\u0027 he said, suggesting previous owners might have realized its importance to the history of the familyThough he was thankful the memories were preserved unscathed, Prince Albert couldn\u0027t really offer much of an explanation for the still-standing treasure.\u0027Maybe they thought we were going to take it back one day,\u0027 he said, suggesting previous owners might have realized its importance to the history of the family. That is a sweet thought, but it\u0027s not likely all of the previous owners had such charming intentions in the back of their minds.The property made headlines in 2014 when its 81-year-old former owner pleaded no contest to animal cruelty charges for keeping cats and dogs in unsanitary conditions on the property.Officials with the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals seized 15 cats from the home and found the remains of several others.The owner had lived in the large brick house since 1973.

She now speaks fluent Swahili, because she was determined to converse with her children in their native tongue.Claire’s own mother couldn’t be more proud of how her daughter has chosen to do things — although she has baulked at some of the challenges she has faced.Take the first time Helen, now 63, flew over to visit in 2012 — just a day or so after grandchild number three, Bella, arrived.When Claire was sent from the orphanage to pick up Bella at a neighbouring village, the word was that this abandoned little bundle of skin and bones, weighing just 10lb, was a few months old. In fact, she turned out to be two years old.Helen remembers Claire patiently tending to the little girl’s tiny fingernails and toenails, but not in the usual way.          First there was Alfie, then 13 months old, a little boy she coaxed to smile, and went on to foster and adopt. Alfie is now ten. His siblings, Layla and Isabella, are eight, and little Jack is five‘I remember sitting watching Claire picking maggots virtually out of every pore. It brought home the conditions these children had been brought up in.’There are other colourful memories, such as that time she put bread in the toaster and ‘all the creepy-crawlies came out’. And Nanny — as Helen is known by the children — hasn’t quite recovered from the fact Claire was perfectly happy sharing the kitchen with a lizard.‘It was on the wall,’ she complains. ‘I had a problem with that. But nothing fazes Claire.’Those exotic anecdotes may be numbered, though. Although it was never Claire’s plan to return to the UK with her children, changing circumstances have forced a rethink, and she is trying to get home — new family in tow.Her own mother could not be happier, and the Skype conversations are all about the move. Alfie is desperate to see snow. And they all want to visit Buckingham Palace, and see a red London bus in real life instead of in the books Nanny sends.There is a problem, though. While love is clearly in abundance in this family, money is not. The political climate in Tanzania (meaning Westerners aren’t finding it as easy to get work) means Claire isn’t working — and is finding it difficult to support her family.While her parents have always helped her out, they aren’t in a position to do so now. Helen works in the catering industry and lives modestly in a one-bedroom home. Claire’s dad, Derek, from whom Helen was amicably orced, died earlier this year.So how can Claire fund the expensive return to the UK? Well, she has turned to that very modern charitable source — crowdfunding, appealing to friends, family and strangers to donate. She needs to raise £34,000 to get herself and the four children back to the UK, the bulk of the money needed for flights and lawyers to assist with the visa applications.

They are pictured here in 2017          Although they have no blood ties, the emotional bonds are as strong as they get. ‘They are typical siblings,’ Claire laughs at their spacious, if slightly chaotic, family home just outside Arusha, in north-eastern TanzaniaYet as much as her own family supports her, not everyone does. News reports about her appeal this week were met with a decidedly mixed reaction.While some applauded Claire’s ‘mission’, others have questioned the idea that she should be financially bailed out when the decision to take on the four children was hers alone.One particularly brutal online commentator called her a potential ‘Madonna on benefits’. And what will happen, some asked, if the family still struggle after they arrive in the UK? Will the taxpayer have to foot the bill?‘The whole point is to get them over here so Claire can work,’ Helen says. ‘She has no intention of being on benefits.‘And if I can say one thing about her is that she is a hard worker. She has never been work-shy — quite the opposite, in fact. She came home when her dad was ill, to be with him when he died, and even in those few weeks she got a job here.’Claire herself is appalled at the suggestion she is trying to milk the system. ‘There is no way I want to be on benefits. It’s not who I am. My parents instilled the idea of hard work in me, and I want to do the same with my children. It’s exactly why I want to come home so they can see me work.’It’s a dilemma Madonna and Angelina Jolie and those high-profile advocates of foreign adoption simply do not face. Deep pockets can smooth all manner of problems.          While her parents have always helped her out, they aren’t in a position to do so now. Helen works in the catering industry and lives modestly in a one-bedroom home. Claire’s dad, Derek, from whom Helen was amicably orced, died earlier this yearClaire will have to rely on family to help with childcare while she works and her plight does raise genuine questions about whether the heart should rule the head even in these emotive matters.Should we applaud Claire’s selflessness in putting these children above all else, or question her naivety in thinking she could do it alone?The family’s answer, of course, is that she is not alone. They are clearly close, and have been through a good deal together. The Claire they waved off to Tanzania at 19 certainly hadn’t had a sheltered life.Claire’s elder brother, Adam, was killed in an accident when he was 12, when a rope became tangled round his neck while he was playing. Understandably, Helen and Derek were highly protective of Claire. ‘But you can’t wrap them in cotton wool,’ she argues. ‘And we tried so hard to bring Claire up to be as independent as possible.‘We were worried when she wanted to go to Tanzania, but we knew how she felt about wanting to work with children,’ Helen says. ‘We heard all about Alfie, who seemed special to her. But I had no idea she was talking about my future grandson!’.Claire has cared for more than 200 children since she arrived in Tanzania in 2009, but Alfie touched her heart most. An orphan, Alfie, then 13 months old, was perhaps not in as pitiful a state physically as some of the other children (‘we couldn’t save some of the babies who were so malnourished when they came in’) but his behaviour upset her.‘He was very withdrawn and bewildered. Toddlers in the orphanage were always more aware than the little babies, and Alfie just wouldn’t smile. I was drawn to him. You try not to favour one child, but because I was trying so hard to get through to him, it was hard. I got to the stage where I coaxed a smile out of him, and a bond developed. He’d look for me if I left the room.’          Five months after Alfie moved in, baby Layla followed. Then came Bella, then JackThat first stint in Tanzania was a short one and Claire returned to the UK to work as a nanny.She felt compelled to go back, however, but when she did she discovered Alfie had been moved to a different orphanage 15km away. She went to visit him. ‘I’m sure he recognised me even at the start,’ she says. ‘But by the end of that visit he was in tears. They had to prise him off me.’Distraught, she wondered if she could somehow sponsor Alfie. But her inquiries led to her asking if she could foster the little boy, and in 2011 she became his sole carer. ‘I still wasn’t thinking adoption,’ she says. ‘At the start, that never occurred to me. And he wasn’t the only one I fostered. I’d often have the sickest babies overnight, or for longer periods. But Alfie stayed.’Five months after Alfie moved in, baby Layla followed. Then came Bella, then Jack. ‘It was a natural progression,’ Claire says.‘It felt right. I’ve always felt that however good an orphanage is, children thrive best in a home situation.’ It was 2016 before the legal process to adopt all four children was completed, but Claire says they felt like ‘hers’ practically from the moment they arrived.Did she ever sit her parents down and tell them about her adoption plans? ‘No,’ she says. ‘But it wasn’t like it was one big decision. It was a series of little ones. And they were always right behind me. They came out and met the children. My dad doted on them. He couldn’t have helped more, and he was really proud of what I was doing.’          \u0027The plan was never to return to the UK, though. ‘I thought our lives would always be in Tanzania,’ Claire saysThe plan was never to return to the UK, though. ‘I thought our lives would always be in Tanzania,’ Claire says.Outwardly, they must seem well off compared to the locals. Like many in the expat community, they have a security guard patrolling their home (‘It’s essential,’ says Claire), and a woman who is employed as a cleaner, cook and babysitter. Whenever Claire was working at the orphanage or, latterly, when she has returned to the UK for visits, this lady has looked after the children.But the lifestyle is no longer tenable. The children have been educated at an international school — so they would be fluent in English — and the fees were not affordable some time ago, ‘but luckily when I explained this the school agreed to let the children stay on anyway’.Hence the idea of moving back. Losing her father has just reinforced the idea that Claire needs to be at home.‘It was such a shock,’ she said. ‘Dad was the fittest person I know. He was never ill. But he collapsed one day, and he was dead seven weeks later. I made it home to see him before he died, but it has been devastating. It’s made me realise I want the children to grow up with their extended family. The expat community is a transient one. At home, we will have support.’But the costs involved are eye-watering. And there are other problems, too. It’s by no means a given that the British authorities will extend the sort of warm welcome the family want, and the state of Claire’s bank account will be a major deciding factor.          Claire has cared for more than 200 children since she arrived in Tanzania in 2009, but Alfie touched her heart most‘To satisfy the immigration authorities, you have to have a certain amount in your bank account, around £5,000, and prove that you can support your children, so we are working towards that,’ says Claire.Her online critics will say she clearly can’t support the children, if she is having to crowdfund. Her reply? ‘But longer term, I will be able to. And the big thing is that we have somewhere to live. We are not asking for State assistance.’Claire’s aunt and uncle have offered her and her children a home in the UK. It will be a squeeze, admits Sally Clifford-Smith, 53, who shares her four-bedroom home with her husband and daughter, 22. ‘But we are so looking forward to getting them all home,’ she adds. ‘We aren’t in a position to hand over thousands of pounds, but we can do this.’For Helen, though, the day that she can throw her arms around her grandchildren on British soil can’t come quickly enough.‘I cannot wait,’ she says. ‘I love these children to bits, and we just want them all home.’To help Claire, donate at youcaring.comtheupshall children-836976"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/11/20/4C1BEFD500000578-0-image-m-70_1526068656020.jpg","title":"A spiky guide royal survival Princess Dianas private secretary","story":"    Meghan will be judged by standards that have never been entirely defined, writes Jephson\u0027It\u0027s not too late to send me an invite\u0027: Meghan Markle\u0027s...Share this articleMemories of Wallis Simpson, the last American orcee to marry into tsheir ranks, are long, unhappy — and regularly resurface.For the Windsors, therefore, the royal wedding represents a momentous gamble.What, then, must Meghan learn?For the hard reality is that survival as a royal newcomer in a 1,000-year-old family business takes much more than a winning smile and a stylish curtsey.Meghan will be judged by standards that have never been entirely defined and cannot be found in any reference book or on any website.But after eight years as Princess Diana\u0027s equerry and then private secretary, I can offer her the following pointers . . .NEVER ROCK THE ROYAL BOATContrary to what some may think, the essential qualification of a new princess is not an encyclopaedic knowledge of obscure palace protocol, nor the ability to maintain a diplomatically acceptable level of small talk with a halitosis-stricken visiting head of state. Nor, even, is it a talent for getting out of a low-slung limousine in a low-cut evening gown while maintaining the highest standards of modesty.Least of all is it a gift for attracting huge crowds of adoring new fans (or acres of drooling newsprint).Instead, the one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force.In the whispering labyrinth of the court, unexpected surprises, even nice ones, can be misinterpreted as threats. Anything new or unknown, until it is proven to be harmless, will therefore be treated with suspicion — even hostility. When you\u0027re in the dynasty business, everything is subjected to the ultimate test: will this personthingideadevelopment help or hinder the survival of the current royal line?          The public\u0027s impression of Diana as a gutsy woman doing her best to help those in need was  essentially accurate. Pictured: Princess Diana and Patrick Jephson in Hungary in 1990It\u0027s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.Why? Because the Windsors know that all the grand trappings of royalty are held in trust for the British people and that the monarchy depends for its survival on a very volatile commodity: the benign approval — or, at the very least, tolerance — of its subjects.They also know that everything they hold dear could be lost through miscalculation. After all, in recent family history, their European counterparts have lost their thrones despite reigning for generations with every appearance of indestructibility.The guillotine may never be erected in Trafalgar Square, but a fickle public mood multiplied by merciless digital media has the capacity to decapitate an unpopular royal family — or family member — as surely as any blade.Postponing that day is the unwritten first duty of those in the British royal dynasty business.So, Meghan\u0027s prime function will be to support the Crown, avoid bringing it into disrepute and act as a non-political focus of national unity. Everything else — even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes — is superfluous. The bottom line is that, as a princess, she has no remit to save the world or anything in it. Or preach at us, admonish us or signal any fashionable virtue.Her job is to exist, preferably without rocking the constitutional boat. And if, in the process, by the way she conducts her own life, she gently inspires us to do more and better with our own, then she\u0027ll probably be treated with respect and remembered with affection far into the future.DON\u0027T FORGET ABOUT THE CHAPSNobody could doubt Meghan\u0027s sincerity when she said: \u0027Right now, with so many campaigns like #MeToo and #TimesUp, there\u0027s no better time to continue to shine a light on women feeling empowered and people supporting them.\u0027However, the perspective that draws such warm applause at Californian awards ceremonies may need adjusting in a nation with a female prime minister and female head of state.Indeed, Meghan\u0027s advisers may also feel uneasy about an attitude that so readily excludes half the population. She might also like to bear in mind that quite a few members of the Royal Family are men and that not all of them have always managed to achieve #MeToo-approved standards of what is considered to be correct male behaviour.          One key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising forceBEWARE THE REST OF THE FAMILYIt\u0027s been several centuries since any of Harry\u0027s forebears cut off the head of a wife who displeased him. But Meghan should be in no doubt about the House of Windsor\u0027s ability and willingness to exercise some very modern tortures on errant newcomers.Among these must be counted the clumsy efforts of some misguided Charles loyalists to smear Diana not just as sad and mad, but bad as well. As the Diana tragedy confirmed, when dealing with perceived threats, Windsors can be quite uncompromising.If you acquire for yourself a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.This will mobilise the full forces of the Establishment against you.And it won\u0027t feel constrained by any fluffy notions of old-fashioned British fair play.Whatever fairytale image Meghan may have once had of palace life, the reality is as old as time: behind the public image, courts are breeding grounds of intrigue, ambition, gossip and jealousy.DON\u0027T LET IT ALL GO TO YOUR HEADOne evening, I accompanied Diana to a glittering New York ceremony at which she was given the Humanitarian of the Year award. This was an honour she\u0027d tried to resist, partly on the grounds that her job meant she should be giving out awards, not receiving them.Afterwards, over a glass of champagne, I told her: \u0027I think you were right to accept this one. You\u0027ve certainly earned it.\u0027She briefly raised her eyebrows, then turned to look at the night-time Manhattan skyline.\u0027No, Patrick, I don\u0027t deserve this,\u0027 she said. Then she raised her glass. \u0027But I am working on it.\u0027That phrase summed up her vision of herself. And it wasn\u0027t a bad poster image for a very successful brand of royalty: modesty and determination.The danger of Meghan forming a false sense of her own worth is very real.    Everything apart from serving the crown - even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes - is superfluousBE TRUE TO YOURSELFA large part of royal interaction — and especially the bit of it we see in public — is a kind of act. When I was at the palace, we used to joke that nine-tenths of being royal was turning up at the right place at the right time in the right clothes with the right speech in your pocket and the right expression on your face.However, Meghan should beware. Any suspicion that your public persona is not an honest reflection of your real personality will become obvious, sooner or later.It\u0027s also wise to remember that hardly anyone, not even a trained actress, can keep up an act for ever. So Meghan may as well decide that the part of her she allows us to see is one that is both real and reliably predictable. Take Princess Diana. The public\u0027s impression of Diana as a gutsy woman doing her best to help those in need — while raising two sons and fulfilling exaggerated expectations as a royal role model — was, as I saw for myself, essentially accurate.People liked what they saw, believed it to be authentic and wanted more of it.ONE THING YOU SHOULD NEVER DOIn a lifetime of royal service, Meghan cannot expect always to please. She should think long and carefully, however, before reaching for the race card as a response to unfavourable news stories.Her erse ancestry is a positive asset for the House of Windsor, as its members and supporters are well aware. But it would be tragic if Meghan or her husband got into the habit of firing ethnic warning shots at the very same media that will reliably trumpet all their good work for years to come.STEER CLEAR OF POLITICSMeghan should make an early vow to avoid all activity or communication that might be interpreted as a comment on politics or public policy. Her reputation won\u0027t survive theatrical interventions in areas that rightly belong to elected politicians.So her widely advertised support for Democratic politics in the U.S. is a piece of personal baggage that must now be jettisoned. The sacred royal duty of political neutrality doesn\u0027t end at the shores of the kingdom.          Top priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royaltySEEK OUT THE BEST ADVICEThe Royals can choose from a limitless smorgasbord of advice — good, bad and downright dangerous. Ultimately, it\u0027s where Meghan chooses to turn for it that will determine much of her success or failure as a princess.Diana didn\u0027t always choose her advisers wisely. By the time she gave a self-sabotaging interview to the BBC\u0027s Panorama, she had an increasing tendency to seek advice from those who saw her as a useful vehicle for their own agendas.Sadly, they encouraged her to portray herself as a victim, rather than as the strong, influential woman I knew her to be.NEVER COMPLAIN, NEVER EXPAINThe Queen has demonstrated over the course of a lifetime that modern monarchy works best when it sticks to the old rule: \u0027Never complain, never explain.\u0027Prince Charles favours a different tactic, drawing criticism for what has been seen as an unwise amount of complaining and an un-royal amount of explaining.Even Harry\u0027s mother was rather too fond of both — although, in Diana\u0027s defence, she may have learned it from her husband.The public doesn\u0027t always respond well to complaints from those who have virtually unlimited resources and plenty of privacy. LEAVE YOUR SHOWBIZ DAYS BEHIND YOUTop priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royalty.Meghan may find that she can\u0027t go to her local shop on Kensington High Street without causing a minor riot. With that kind of profile, it\u0027s all too easy to think your very existence is cause for celebration.For Meghan, who has devoted so much energy to acquiring celebrity, the task of distinguishing between fame she\u0027s earned and fame she has acquired through Harry may be particularly hard. So, if she hasn\u0027t worked it out yet, now is the time to get it clear in her own mind.Get it wrong and she may never be forgiven.Meghan is particularly vulnerable in this respect because there\u0027ll always be sceptics ready to question whether her marriage is a love story or just part of a long-running fame campaign. Although many of the perks of royalty and celebrity are identical, the defining difference is that celebrity lifestyles are won, while royal privileges are granted.They exist in return for a life devoted to service, with lots of visible, unenviable duty and the appearance of sacrifice.Meghan may have already worked out that huge public warmth is directed at Harry and would be shared by anyone he chose to marry.So, even more than most royal newcomers, she\u0027ll be judged by her success as the never-failing source to her husband of strength, comfort, encouragement and wisdom.If Meghan allows doubt to grow that she is anything less than devoted to her man, his family and her obligations to her adopted country, then she may not have the luxury of any second chances.          \u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animalsKEEP OPINIONS TO YOURSELFBeing royal means that you will automatically always be heard, even when you just whisper.It\u0027s a magical power, given to very few and earned by even fewer.Unlike a struggling actress, a princess will be listened to respectfully and in silence, bar a few polite laughs at the right moments.This readily given approval can all too easily give the speaker an inflated and dangerously misleading perception of her own oratory and intellect.The Royal Family usually does best when it follows the example of the Queen.Despite having a powerful platform on which to share her views, insights, big ideas, wishes and prejudices, Her Majesty has resolutely kept her opinions to herself. AVOID CUDDLY ANIMALSCentral to Diana\u0027s success as a humanitarian was her instinct for what made best use of both her status and her compassion.She focused on causes that resonate in the public mind.Her sons have developed their own distinctive and admirable style. But one area where they\u0027ve taken a very different tack is in their promotion of conservation, especially in Africa.\u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animals.The most eloquent speech on the evils of the ivory trade will still do little to boost Meghan\u0027s profile.AND FINALLY...REAP THE REWARDSThe best news for Meghan, for Harry and for an expectant British public is that if she gets it right, the reward will be the secure evolution of the great institution that has welcomed her — and two lives made complete by their service to humanity.  Adapted from The Meghan Factor by Patrick Jephson, published by Bombardier Books, priced £11.22 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/01/044D3588000007D0-0-image-m-13_1525740168377.jpg","title":"Record employment figures suggest key happiness really holding 9 5","story":"    The key to happiness really is holding down a stable job, say experts (stock photo)Proof benefits cap DOES work: 48,000 drop in the number of...Unemployment could be set to fall to levels not seen since...Share this articleThe findings are a boon for Theresa May and the Tories, who have overseen falling unemployment since 2010.Latest figures show more than 32million are in work – the most ever.

It also has a lightweight carrying bag. The downside? It probably works best on an Australian beach. On a sunny British afternoon, the tube barely warmed up at all, even though I left it out all day.Verdict: Disaster. My sausages came out hardly lukewarm, let alone cooked or edible. And the narrow tube can only fit food for one person at a time.  SOLAR MASON JARS (various suppliers)Every trendy garden party needs a mason jar these days, whether it’s to drink cocktails from or to hold artfully rustic wildflower arrangements.Now, you can even use them as lighting and decoration rolled into one thanks to the solar panels hidden in the lids.          Every trendy garden party needs a mason jar these days - and these are truly usefulMy favourite, a blue-and-green stripy one from Argos (£9.99, argos.co.uk), stored enough sun in two hours to properly light up my dinner table in the evening, casting out pretty radiating stripes of coloured light onto my white tablecloth and lasting five hours or more.A jar containing a string of 50 delicate fairy lights also did solid service as a table light (£9.99, argos.co.uk).Sainsbury’s does a fun supersize range, too (£28), with rattan ropes so you can hang them from branches or stand them on the patio.Verdict: Truly useful — and so pretty. Never faff about with a candle lantern again!  SOLAR RADIO (£24.99, amazon.co.uk)          A solar radio is a great garden-enhancing purchaseWhy pay for batteries or battle with endless extension leads when you can harness the power of the sun to listen to your favourite radio station in the garden — for up to six hours? You may wonder when you try this robust little gadget with a flip-up solar panel on top that charges to full in four hours of medium sun.It comes with a powerful reading light and torch — and there’s even an alarmingly loud SOS alarm, presumably for campers who run into trouble in the wild, but you could easily use it to signal to your other half that it’s time for another G\u0026ampT . . .Verdict: A garden-enhancing buy.  TRUEFLAME TORCH LIGHTS (£24.99, thesolarcentre.co.uk)These torch-style garden lights promise to add an oddly medieval touch to your garden parties. They even come with a spike so you can easily dig them into your flowerbed or lawn.They charge up during the day in direct sunlight and switch on at dusk, producing an attractive flickering flame effect for most of the night.          The TrueFlame torch lights are stylish, unusual and perfect for a garden partyKeep them clear of any shady areas, though — the strength of the light depends on how much sun they get through the day.The design has also been adapted for the British weather, and the maker claims you can even use them in winter.Verdict: Stylish and unusual — perfect if you plan to party in the garden until dawn.  FLOATING POOL FOUNTAIN (£24.99, amazon.co.uk)Every garden needs a water feature — and having no pond, or even space to put one, need not be a hindrance any longer.This hilarious floating fountain sits in your paddling pool, and uses a solar panel the size of an iPad to produce a jet of squirting water nearly a foot high, albeit with a loud churning noise from the internal motor.

As long as the sun shines, that is — because comically, as soon as it goes behind a cloud, the fountain slows to a pathetic dribble before subsiding altogether. What a disappointment!You also have to connect the solar panel to the fountain via a rather unattractive thick black wire, which ruins the look a bit.Verdict: Inconsistent — still, it’s a fun party trick for a truly cloudless sunny day.  SOLAR WIND SPINNER (£12.99, aldi.co.uk)          The solar wind spinner takes two days to charge fully but runs beautifullyAt 130cm high — about the height of a tall sunflower — this brushed bronze wind spinner adds a decorative touch to your garden.It takes a bit of a breeze to get the blades spinning, but looks great. There’s also a solar-powered globe light in the middle, which changes colour at night. It takes two days to charge fully, but runs beautifully.Verdict: Pretty, if a little pointless. It will definitely confuse the moths.  FAIRY HOUSE (£11.99, amazon.co.uk)          This fairy house would be a sure winner with young childrenThis wood-effect — but actually extremely plastic — fairy house has a small solar panel on the roof. The idea is that it stores the sun’s rays during the day — taking four hours to charge — then produces a warm orange glow through most of the night.After a full day’s charging, the fairy house did light up dimly and looked slightly magical, I have to admit. A similar lighthouse model I tried did nothing much, however.Verdict: A sure winner with young children — if parents can bear the tacky plastic look of it during the day  INTEX POOL HEATING PAD (£21, amazon.co.uk)Even with the mercury rising, there’s nothing fun about dipping a toe into a freezing paddling pool.So after filling mine with icy water, I hopefully attached this heating pad.          The Intex pool heating pad would probably work well in the Sahara...A pump takes water from your pool via a hose and pushes it through a thin, 1.2 m sq black pad, where it heats up as it’s exposed to the sun’s rays beating down on the pad, before being pumped back into the pool. Or at least that’s the idea. So, was it worth covering up part of my carefully tended lawn with the ugly PVC pad?After three hours of soaking up the rays, the pad was very hot to touch (beware any toddler running onto it!).However, there was no discernible difference in pool water temperature all day — let alone the extra 3-5c it promised.Verdict: Maybe it would work in the Sahara, but it did nothing in Britain’s milder climate.  SOLAR CHARGER POWER BANK (£13.99, amazon.co.uk)This sounds perfect for outdoor weekends when you never get time to plug in your phone. It’s a block about the size of an iPhone, with 20 solar-powered cells on its surface.However, it promises far more than it delivers. It took all day to charge and then barely got my phone to 10 per cent battery in two hours.Verdict: This really is a last resort — when you on a long country walk or having a day out far from any power points.          This solar charger power bank promises far more than it delivers            The beauty of this watch is that it charges from a solar cell hidden in the clockfaceCASIO \u0027TOUGH SOLAR\u0027 WATCH (£34.99, amazon.co.uk)Most of us have suffered a wristwatch battery conking out. The beauty of this watch is that it charges from a solar cell hidden in the clockface. However you may end up being late if you don’t adjust your wardrobe accordingly — if covered by long sleeves, it may run down.It’s incredibly easy to recharge, taking ten minutes in sunshine or up to an hour through a window. Also, it’s waterproof and includes a stopwatch to time your laps in the swimming pool.Verdict: It will keep summer ticking away nicely.  RETRO LIGHTS (string of 4, £4.99 Aldi.co.uk, or set of six clip-ons, £12.99, argos.co.uk)The beauty of solar power is there’s no fuss. There are no wires or electricity needed, you simply hang these pretty retro fairy lights wherever you want them, and they charge for two hours then shine all night long. Made of non-breakable plastic, they come either in a string to drape over tree branches, or as oversized single bulbs in blue and green — to add a carnival feel.Verdict: Party heaven, as long as you have some other light source, too. The light is fairly dim but the glow looks cosy and inviting.

Over the same period average fees increased from £11,300 a year to £17,200 now.Even some private school heads themselves have admitted that their traditional parents have been priced out and increasingly school places are instead filled with children of the world’s super-wealthy.Although the Durham school’s budget is tight, its leaders say they can cut costs by not having grand facilities such as swimming pools – and much of the money will be spent on hiring good teachers.The headmaster, Chris Gray, was previously head of Grindon Hall Christian School, which failed an Ofsted inspection several years ago because of the government’s ‘British values’ drive. Although it had previously been judged as ‘good’, it was downgraded because inspectors thought it did not teach pupils to respect other faiths and communities enough.  A school has banned expensive pencil cases to stop children from poorer families feeling stigmatised. St Wilfrid’s Primary School in Blyth, Northumberland, brought in the change as part of a ‘poverty proofing’ drive to help pupils feel more included.So-called ‘designer pencil cases’ – which often have extra features such as lights and cost upwards of £10 – were singled out because they stand out on desks. The school said the move would ensure ‘there’s no comparison’ between pupils. It has also introduced a standard backpack and stopped requiring donations on home clothes days. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/12/00/4C1E329A00000578-0-image-a-24_1526079816392.jpg","title":"Terrified tourists run cover Disney parade","story":"    Video of the incident shows the head of the animatronic beast completely engulfed in fire, moving towards the crowd as black smoke billows to the sky          The attraction is Maleficent\u0027s dragon and part of the Magic Kingdom\u0027s daily Festival of Fantasy parade located in Liberty SquareMaleficent, the self-proclaimed \u0027Mistress of All Evil,\u0027 is a \u0027dark fairy\u0027 who first made her appearance in the Disney animated classic \u0027Sleeping Beauty\u0027 released in 1959.The fire was extinguished by a park employee and the area was cleared for tourists shortly thereafter.

In his absence, it is left to the surgery\u0027s 3,300 patients to voice their fury. \u0027It\u0027s ridiculous,\u0027 said grandmother Joyce Noley, 58.\u0027This place is vital. It has been here ever since I have, and that\u0027s 40 years. There are lots of old and disabled people. Where are they meant to go?\u0027 Retired cleaner Ellen Charles, a 71-year-old asthmatic who lives with her husband Alan, 67, who has survived a stroke, added: \u0027I was devastated when I found it was closing down. It couldn\u0027t be more convenient. The doctors knew my name and I knew the girls behind reception. Now that\u0027s all gone.\u0027 As for 89-year-old Connie Scott, a greatgrandmother and patient of Osler House since it opened, she learned about the closure in a letter sent in February.Patients calling 999 will be told to show handlers a live...Women and bereaved families caught in NHS breast cancer...Share this articleShe now faces a four-bus round-trip taking more than 40 minutes each way to see a new doctor.\u0027When I found out about the closure, I was so angry it actually made me ill for a few days,\u0027 said Mrs Scott, who became the face of protest at the closure in an online video. \u0027I\u0027ve been so happy in Harlow but this has broken my heart.\u0027What has added to the sense of anger are the circumstances in which the surgery was shut. The decision to close Osler House was taken without any consultation with patients. The powers-that-be simply informed them they had no choice but to shut the surgery for good.Osler House was too small, too expensive to run and no other practice wanted to take on the contract, the West Essex Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) claimed. They even tried to spin the closure as good news.\u0027There is now a huge opportunity for patients to benefit from the services offered by local larger health centre teams nearby,\u0027 the CCG said in a letter to Robert Halfon, Harlow\u0027s Conservative MP. But is that what patients really want? Not according to Mrs Scott and her fellow patients. They say that proximity to a surgery where they can see a doctor who knows them is what matters above all. Sadly, the reality is that up and down the country, 700 surgeries, many of them smaller ones, have closed over the past five years.Today, one in four is a \u0027superpractice\u0027 with more than 10,000 patients on its books, and the proportion of surgeries with such list sizes has risen by 27 per cent since 2013.But that isn\u0027t the only way in which general practice has changed in Britain, because Osler House wasn\u0027t run by a local GP or a partnership of doctors, but by a private company.Called The Practice Group (TPG), this company is responsible for some 50 GP practices and healthcare centres, providing more than a million appointments each year for 200,000 patients across the country.           The Practice Group (TPG) is majority-owned by a hugely wealthy health insurance company based 4,000 miles from Harlow in St Louis, Missouri (pictured)In 2016, the company was paid almost £30 million by the NHS for its services. And yet the reason it gave for pulling out of the contract with Osler House? That it was no longer \u0027financially viable\u0027 for it to run it. Nor is this the first time that The Practice Group has pulled the plug on GP surgeries because it was not being paid enough.Which is, perhaps, all the more surprising because TPG is, in turn, majority-owned by a hugely wealthy health insurance company based 4,000 miles from Harlow in St Louis, Missouri.Called the Centene Corporation, its motto is \u0027Better health outcomes at lower costs\u0027.It\u0027s a corporate behemoth, with revenues tipped t o hit £45 billion in 2018 and a chief executive who pocketed £18.6 million last year.Yet currently, it is facing legal action in the States, accused of failing to provide its customers with the medical services they have paid for. \u0027There are some serious issues in this case,\u0027 says Seth Lesser, a New York lawyer acting for some of the claimants.\u0027Centene appears to be an example where the private market is not doing a good job.\u0027 Concerns over the involvement of foreign firms in the running of the NHS heightened as it emerged that an IT company from Dallas was at the centre of the scandal over women missing breast cancer checks having had a contract to run the software for the NHS\u0027s screening programme since 2015.The company denied responsibility for the glitch. Dr Richard Vautrey, the BMA\u0027s GP committee chairman, says there are certainly worries about the involvement of private companies in the provision of primary care. \u0027Practices are being closed because they are no longer financially viable,\u0027 he told the Mail.\u0027Private companies are more likely to walk away from those contracts than GPs who are committed to the local community. \u0027The normal model remains a group of GPs working in a partnership. If you are the business owner and also on the shop floor day by day seeing patients, then you are likely to be more responsive to their needs than if you are a remote business owner who doesn\u0027t have direct contact with patients on a daily basis.The key point is that whoever is running the business needs to be directly connected with the local community.\u0027 For the first 50 years of the NHS, a general practice typically comprised one or more doctors working alone or in a partnership in shared premises under a standard contract with the government. But new types of contract were introduced under a Labour government in 1998 and 2004 that were locally negotiated and allowed commercial, voluntary sector and other new providers to offer GP services. Since then, a number of privately-run commercial companies, both big and small, have entered the market.Their share is put at less than five per cent of the 7,500-odd GP surgeries in England — but amid mounting pressures to cut NHS costs, it is a sector with the potential for massive growth. Of the private companies active in the primary care market — Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care is one such player — The Practice Group is amongst the largest. It was set up in 2005 by two GPs, Dr Jeremy Rose and Dr Ajit Kadirgamar, and Peter Watts, a former investment banker.Based in Amersham, Bucks, the company started out by winning a contract to supply GPs to carry out ward rounds at the local hospital. It was then awarded three contracts to run GP surgeries, and over the years has taken on more contracts, as well as surgeries in prisons, walk-in centres and specialist clinics.By centralising IT, human resources and other admin functions, The Practice Group hoped to maximise profits. In a 2010 newspaper interview, Mr Watts, then chief executive (he no longer works for the company), spoke of his ambition to grow its turnover from £18 million to £100 million in five years. \u0027The more patients we get, the more economic we become,\u0027 he said. \u0027It works on an actuarial analysis the more patients you have, the less risk you carry.And if we can do it for less, why not?\u0027 That same year, The Practice Group merged with another company to give them a total portfolio of 50 practices and healthcare units. \u0027Bigger is better,\u0027 Mr Watts said at the time. As well as investment from the founders, TPG has received substantial injections of cash.But despite its ambitions, it has not declared a profit in any year for which accounts are available. The 2016 accounts report a loss of £1.3 million on a turnover of £29.5 million, while in 2015 there was loss of £637,000 on a turnover of £28.9 million. During its lifetime, investors have put £19.5 million into the business. In 2015, this included a £4.16 million investment by the American health giant Centene for a 49 per cent share of the business. In 2016, Centene increased its interest to 75 per cent with an additional £5.18 million investment.According to a note on the The Practice Group accounts, Centene plans to inject further cash in the future. Such sums are small beer for Centene, which is one of the biggest players in America\u0027s multibillion dollar health insurance market. It employs 32,000 staff, many of them at its swanky HQ on Centene Plaza in downtown St Louis.In the U.S. alone, the company and its subsidiaries serve 12.3 million people in 28 states. Centene has concentrated on providing insurance for the uninsured or under-insured, from cash-strapped middle income families to prison inmates.          Concerns over the involvement of foreign firms in the running of the NHS heightened as it emerged that an IT company from Dallas was at the centre of the scandal over women missing breast cancer checks (stock image)This year, it expects to earn more than £45 billion. Much of its success has come under the leadership of 74-year-old chief executive and chairman Michael Neidorff, the highest-paid executive of the eight largest publicly traded health insurers in the U.S. He and his wife, Noemi, a Hungarian-born pianist, are generous patrons of St Louis\u0027 arts scene, particularly the opera. But the Centene success story is not without controversy.Every U.S. health insurance company has to provide customers with a local list of doctors, dentists, hospitals and other medical organisations who accept their insurance plans. However, in a federal \u0027class action\u0027 lawsuit announced in January, Centene has been accused of not providing adequate access to doctors in 15 states. \u0027Members have difficulty finding — in many cases cannot find — medical providers,\u0027 according to documents filed in the multi- million dollar lawsuit.Buyers of its Ambetter insurance plan around the U.S. \u0027report strikingly similar experiences\u0027, finding that the provider network was \u0027largely fictitious\u0027.Nurses, medical students and even non-doctors have been designated as primary care providers, it is claimed. But customers discovered this only after they had paid thousands of dollars and were locked into the policy, it is alleged. People signing up for Centene insurance \u0027discovered there were no doctors\u0027, says lawyer Mr Lesser.\u0027In America, Centene has grown much too fast to be able to service all the people for whom it issued insurance,\u0027 Mr Lesser says. \u0027We have also seen that Centene has been refusing to provide benefits that it is supposed to be providing. It\u0027s an insurance company that likes to collect premiums but doesn\u0027t like to pay claims.\u0027 A Centene spokesman said: \u0027Our networks are adequate and we work in partnership with our states to ensure our networks are adequate and our members have access to high-quality healthcare.\u0027Centene refused to discuss with the Mail its plans for the UK or the row over The Practice Group\u0027s decision to close a surgery.With that background, what is to be made of the recent actions of TPG, its subsidiary in the UK? The closure of its Harlow practice is not the first to cause controversy.It faced protests two years ago when it terminated contracts to run f ive smal l practices in Brighton, leaving 11,500 patients looking for a new GP. Again, a potential cut in funding was given as the reason.It has also closed a surgery in Camden Road, London, the Maybury surgery in Woking, the Brandon Street practice in Leicester and the Arboretum surgery in Nottingham.In Harlow, TPG gave six months\u0027 notice on October 31 last year to the Clinical Commissioning Group that it wanted to end its contract to run Osler House. In an explanatory letter to the local MP, the CCG stated: \u0027The reason for the notice is that the provider has stated that it is not financially viable to continue to provide the services within the current NHS contract value.\u0027 It added that the practice had been consistently expensive to run due to the low number of patients and that a recent review had seen the funding cut. Half of that reduction came into place on April 1, 2017, and the other 50pc was to take effect on April 1, 2018.           A spokesman for West Essex CCG said Osler House patients were now registered with one of ten other surgeries in Harlow, three of which are within 1.2 miles (stock image)Eighteen months ago, The Practice Group had assured the CCG that the company were committed to continuing delivery of the contract after April 2018. Presumably, at some point, TPG decided the figures did not add up. Questions are now being asked about the CCG\u0027s failure to consult and its role in the closure. \u0027CCGs should have a duty to properly consult with local residents before making major changes to the services they receive,\u0027 says local MP Mr Halfon.A spokesman for West Essex CCG said Osler House patients were now registered with one of ten other surgeries in Harlow, three of which are within 1.2 miles.TPG has said: \u0027The well-being of patients is central to every decision we make at The Practice Group, which is why we have worked closely with the local NHS commissioning body, West Essex CCG and other local practices to ensure the handful of patients we have receive uninterrupted care provision.\u0027Most importantly, the Osler House patients are now registered with other local surgeries.\u0027 For hundreds of former patients of a much-loved practice, that is simply not good enough."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/22/4C114DDD00000578-0-image-a-19_1525989465294.jpg","title":"Queens official composer snubbed Meghan Markle opts gospel group","story":"    Judith Weir (pictured), who is the first woman to be Master of the Queen’s Music, tells me she has not been invited to contribute to the big day\u0027I\u0027m not so well now\u0027: Alzheimer\u0027s-hit Barbara Windsor has...Fugitive who \u0027killed and butchered convicted paedophile then...Share this articleTwo works by her predecessor, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, were performed at Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding in 2011.The Queen’s wedding in 1947 started with a specially composed fanfare by Sir Arnold Bax, who was then Master of the King’s Music.

They are based in Nigeria and are feeding money into Boko Haram.\u0027He added there were \u0027gun battles\u0027 every month in the north of Gabon, increasing the need for training from UK troops.Gabon loses up to 5,000 forest elephants a year from poaching and the illegal ivory trade there is worth around £11million a year.

She now speaks fluent Swahili, because she was determined to converse with her children in their native tongue.Claire’s own mother couldn’t be more proud of how her daughter has chosen to do things — although she has baulked at some of the challenges she has faced.Take the first time Helen, now 63, flew over to visit in 2012 — just a day or so after grandchild number three, Bella, arrived.When Claire was sent from the orphanage to pick up Bella at a neighbouring village, the word was that this abandoned little bundle of skin and bones, weighing just 10lb, was a few months old. In fact, she turned out to be two years old.Helen remembers Claire patiently tending to the little girl’s tiny fingernails and toenails, but not in the usual way.          First there was Alfie, then 13 months old, a little boy she coaxed to smile, and went on to foster and adopt. Alfie is now ten. His siblings, Layla and Isabella, are eight, and little Jack is five‘I remember sitting watching Claire picking maggots virtually out of every pore. It brought home the conditions these children had been brought up in.’There are other colourful memories, such as that time she put bread in the toaster and ‘all the creepy-crawlies came out’. And Nanny — as Helen is known by the children — hasn’t quite recovered from the fact Claire was perfectly happy sharing the kitchen with a lizard.‘It was on the wall,’ she complains. ‘I had a problem with that. But nothing fazes Claire.’Those exotic anecdotes may be numbered, though. Although it was never Claire’s plan to return to the UK with her children, changing circumstances have forced a rethink, and she is trying to get home — new family in tow.Her own mother could not be happier, and the Skype conversations are all about the move. Alfie is desperate to see snow. And they all want to visit Buckingham Palace, and see a red London bus in real life instead of in the books Nanny sends.There is a problem, though. While love is clearly in abundance in this family, money is not. The political climate in Tanzania (meaning Westerners aren’t finding it as easy to get work) means Claire isn’t working — and is finding it difficult to support her family.While her parents have always helped her out, they aren’t in a position to do so now. Helen works in the catering industry and lives modestly in a one-bedroom home. Claire’s dad, Derek, from whom Helen was amicably orced, died earlier this year.So how can Claire fund the expensive return to the UK? Well, she has turned to that very modern charitable source — crowdfunding, appealing to friends, family and strangers to donate. She needs to raise £34,000 to get herself and the four children back to the UK, the bulk of the money needed for flights and lawyers to assist with the visa applications.

They are pictured here in 2017          Although they have no blood ties, the emotional bonds are as strong as they get. ‘They are typical siblings,’ Claire laughs at their spacious, if slightly chaotic, family home just outside Arusha, in north-eastern TanzaniaYet as much as her own family supports her, not everyone does. News reports about her appeal this week were met with a decidedly mixed reaction.While some applauded Claire’s ‘mission’, others have questioned the idea that she should be financially bailed out when the decision to take on the four children was hers alone.One particularly brutal online commentator called her a potential ‘Madonna on benefits’. And what will happen, some asked, if the family still struggle after they arrive in the UK? Will the taxpayer have to foot the bill?‘The whole point is to get them over here so Claire can work,’ Helen says. ‘She has no intention of being on benefits.‘And if I can say one thing about her is that she is a hard worker. She has never been work-shy — quite the opposite, in fact. She came home when her dad was ill, to be with him when he died, and even in those few weeks she got a job here.’Claire herself is appalled at the suggestion she is trying to milk the system. ‘There is no way I want to be on benefits. It’s not who I am. My parents instilled the idea of hard work in me, and I want to do the same with my children. It’s exactly why I want to come home so they can see me work.’It’s a dilemma Madonna and Angelina Jolie and those high-profile advocates of foreign adoption simply do not face. Deep pockets can smooth all manner of problems.          While her parents have always helped her out, they aren’t in a position to do so now. Helen works in the catering industry and lives modestly in a one-bedroom home. Claire’s dad, Derek, from whom Helen was amicably orced, died earlier this yearClaire will have to rely on family to help with childcare while she works and her plight does raise genuine questions about whether the heart should rule the head even in these emotive matters.Should we applaud Claire’s selflessness in putting these children above all else, or question her naivety in thinking she could do it alone?The family’s answer, of course, is that she is not alone. They are clearly close, and have been through a good deal together. The Claire they waved off to Tanzania at 19 certainly hadn’t had a sheltered life.Claire’s elder brother, Adam, was killed in an accident when he was 12, when a rope became tangled round his neck while he was playing. Understandably, Helen and Derek were highly protective of Claire. ‘But you can’t wrap them in cotton wool,’ she argues. ‘And we tried so hard to bring Claire up to be as independent as possible.‘We were worried when she wanted to go to Tanzania, but we knew how she felt about wanting to work with children,’ Helen says. ‘We heard all about Alfie, who seemed special to her. But I had no idea she was talking about my future grandson!’.Claire has cared for more than 200 children since she arrived in Tanzania in 2009, but Alfie touched her heart most. An orphan, Alfie, then 13 months old, was perhaps not in as pitiful a state physically as some of the other children (‘we couldn’t save some of the babies who were so malnourished when they came in’) but his behaviour upset her.‘He was very withdrawn and bewildered. Toddlers in the orphanage were always more aware than the little babies, and Alfie just wouldn’t smile. I was drawn to him. You try not to favour one child, but because I was trying so hard to get through to him, it was hard. I got to the stage where I coaxed a smile out of him, and a bond developed. He’d look for me if I left the room.’          Five months after Alfie moved in, baby Layla followed. Then came Bella, then JackThat first stint in Tanzania was a short one and Claire returned to the UK to work as a nanny.She felt compelled to go back, however, but when she did she discovered Alfie had been moved to a different orphanage 15km away. She went to visit him. ‘I’m sure he recognised me even at the start,’ she says. ‘But by the end of that visit he was in tears. They had to prise him off me.’Distraught, she wondered if she could somehow sponsor Alfie. But her inquiries led to her asking if she could foster the little boy, and in 2011 she became his sole carer. ‘I still wasn’t thinking adoption,’ she says. ‘At the start, that never occurred to me. And he wasn’t the only one I fostered. I’d often have the sickest babies overnight, or for longer periods. But Alfie stayed.’Five months after Alfie moved in, baby Layla followed. Then came Bella, then Jack. ‘It was a natural progression,’ Claire says.‘It felt right. I’ve always felt that however good an orphanage is, children thrive best in a home situation.’ It was 2016 before the legal process to adopt all four children was completed, but Claire says they felt like ‘hers’ practically from the moment they arrived.Did she ever sit her parents down and tell them about her adoption plans? ‘No,’ she says. ‘But it wasn’t like it was one big decision. It was a series of little ones. And they were always right behind me. They came out and met the children. My dad doted on them. He couldn’t have helped more, and he was really proud of what I was doing.’          \u0027The plan was never to return to the UK, though. ‘I thought our lives would always be in Tanzania,’ Claire saysThe plan was never to return to the UK, though. ‘I thought our lives would always be in Tanzania,’ Claire says.Outwardly, they must seem well off compared to the locals. Like many in the expat community, they have a security guard patrolling their home (‘It’s essential,’ says Claire), and a woman who is employed as a cleaner, cook and babysitter. Whenever Claire was working at the orphanage or, latterly, when she has returned to the UK for visits, this lady has looked after the children.But the lifestyle is no longer tenable. The children have been educated at an international school — so they would be fluent in English — and the fees were not affordable some time ago, ‘but luckily when I explained this the school agreed to let the children stay on anyway’.Hence the idea of moving back. Losing her father has just reinforced the idea that Claire needs to be at home.‘It was such a shock,’ she said. ‘Dad was the fittest person I know. He was never ill. But he collapsed one day, and he was dead seven weeks later. I made it home to see him before he died, but it has been devastating. It’s made me realise I want the children to grow up with their extended family. The expat community is a transient one. At home, we will have support.’But the costs involved are eye-watering. And there are other problems, too. It’s by no means a given that the British authorities will extend the sort of warm welcome the family want, and the state of Claire’s bank account will be a major deciding factor.          Claire has cared for more than 200 children since she arrived in Tanzania in 2009, but Alfie touched her heart most‘To satisfy the immigration authorities, you have to have a certain amount in your bank account, around £5,000, and prove that you can support your children, so we are working towards that,’ says Claire.Her online critics will say she clearly can’t support the children, if she is having to crowdfund. Her reply? ‘But longer term, I will be able to. And the big thing is that we have somewhere to live. We are not asking for State assistance.’Claire’s aunt and uncle have offered her and her children a home in the UK. It will be a squeeze, admits Sally Clifford-Smith, 53, who shares her four-bedroom home with her husband and daughter, 22. ‘But we are so looking forward to getting them all home,’ she adds. ‘We aren’t in a position to hand over thousands of pounds, but we can do this.’For Helen, though, the day that she can throw her arms around her grandchildren on British soil can’t come quickly enough.‘I cannot wait,’ she says. ‘I love these children to bits, and we just want them all home.’To help Claire, donate at youcaring.comtheupshall children-836976"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/11/20/4C1BEFD500000578-0-image-m-70_1526068656020.jpg","title":"A spiky guide royal survival Princess Dianas private secretary","story":"    Meghan will be judged by standards that have never been entirely defined, writes Jephson\u0027It\u0027s not too late to send me an invite\u0027: Meghan Markle\u0027s...Share this articleMemories of Wallis Simpson, the last American orcee to marry into tsheir ranks, are long, unhappy — and regularly resurface.For the Windsors, therefore, the royal wedding represents a momentous gamble.What, then, must Meghan learn?For the hard reality is that survival as a royal newcomer in a 1,000-year-old family business takes much more than a winning smile and a stylish curtsey.Meghan will be judged by standards that have never been entirely defined and cannot be found in any reference book or on any website.But after eight years as Princess Diana\u0027s equerry and then private secretary, I can offer her the following pointers . . .NEVER ROCK THE ROYAL BOATContrary to what some may think, the essential qualification of a new princess is not an encyclopaedic knowledge of obscure palace protocol, nor the ability to maintain a diplomatically acceptable level of small talk with a halitosis-stricken visiting head of state. Nor, even, is it a talent for getting out of a low-slung limousine in a low-cut evening gown while maintaining the highest standards of modesty.Least of all is it a gift for attracting huge crowds of adoring new fans (or acres of drooling newsprint).Instead, the one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force.In the whispering labyrinth of the court, unexpected surprises, even nice ones, can be misinterpreted as threats. Anything new or unknown, until it is proven to be harmless, will therefore be treated with suspicion — even hostility. When you\u0027re in the dynasty business, everything is subjected to the ultimate test: will this personthingideadevelopment help or hinder the survival of the current royal line?          The public\u0027s impression of Diana as a gutsy woman doing her best to help those in need was  essentially accurate. Pictured: Princess Diana and Patrick Jephson in Hungary in 1990It\u0027s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.Why? Because the Windsors know that all the grand trappings of royalty are held in trust for the British people and that the monarchy depends for its survival on a very volatile commodity: the benign approval — or, at the very least, tolerance — of its subjects.They also know that everything they hold dear could be lost through miscalculation. After all, in recent family history, their European counterparts have lost their thrones despite reigning for generations with every appearance of indestructibility.The guillotine may never be erected in Trafalgar Square, but a fickle public mood multiplied by merciless digital media has the capacity to decapitate an unpopular royal family — or family member — as surely as any blade.Postponing that day is the unwritten first duty of those in the British royal dynasty business.So, Meghan\u0027s prime function will be to support the Crown, avoid bringing it into disrepute and act as a non-political focus of national unity. Everything else — even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes — is superfluous. The bottom line is that, as a princess, she has no remit to save the world or anything in it. Or preach at us, admonish us or signal any fashionable virtue.Her job is to exist, preferably without rocking the constitutional boat. And if, in the process, by the way she conducts her own life, she gently inspires us to do more and better with our own, then she\u0027ll probably be treated with respect and remembered with affection far into the future.DON\u0027T FORGET ABOUT THE CHAPSNobody could doubt Meghan\u0027s sincerity when she said: \u0027Right now, with so many campaigns like #MeToo and #TimesUp, there\u0027s no better time to continue to shine a light on women feeling empowered and people supporting them.\u0027However, the perspective that draws such warm applause at Californian awards ceremonies may need adjusting in a nation with a female prime minister and female head of state.Indeed, Meghan\u0027s advisers may also feel uneasy about an attitude that so readily excludes half the population. She might also like to bear in mind that quite a few members of the Royal Family are men and that not all of them have always managed to achieve #MeToo-approved standards of what is considered to be correct male behaviour.          One key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising forceBEWARE THE REST OF THE FAMILYIt\u0027s been several centuries since any of Harry\u0027s forebears cut off the head of a wife who displeased him. But Meghan should be in no doubt about the House of Windsor\u0027s ability and willingness to exercise some very modern tortures on errant newcomers.Among these must be counted the clumsy efforts of some misguided Charles loyalists to smear Diana not just as sad and mad, but bad as well. As the Diana tragedy confirmed, when dealing with perceived threats, Windsors can be quite uncompromising.If you acquire for yourself a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.This will mobilise the full forces of the Establishment against you.And it won\u0027t feel constrained by any fluffy notions of old-fashioned British fair play.Whatever fairytale image Meghan may have once had of palace life, the reality is as old as time: behind the public image, courts are breeding grounds of intrigue, ambition, gossip and jealousy.DON\u0027T LET IT ALL GO TO YOUR HEADOne evening, I accompanied Diana to a glittering New York ceremony at which she was given the Humanitarian of the Year award. This was an honour she\u0027d tried to resist, partly on the grounds that her job meant she should be giving out awards, not receiving them.Afterwards, over a glass of champagne, I told her: \u0027I think you were right to accept this one. You\u0027ve certainly earned it.\u0027She briefly raised her eyebrows, then turned to look at the night-time Manhattan skyline.\u0027No, Patrick, I don\u0027t deserve this,\u0027 she said. Then she raised her glass. \u0027But I am working on it.\u0027That phrase summed up her vision of herself. And it wasn\u0027t a bad poster image for a very successful brand of royalty: modesty and determination.The danger of Meghan forming a false sense of her own worth is very real.    Everything apart from serving the crown - even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes - is superfluousBE TRUE TO YOURSELFA large part of royal interaction — and especially the bit of it we see in public — is a kind of act. When I was at the palace, we used to joke that nine-tenths of being royal was turning up at the right place at the right time in the right clothes with the right speech in your pocket and the right expression on your face.However, Meghan should beware. Any suspicion that your public persona is not an honest reflection of your real personality will become obvious, sooner or later.It\u0027s also wise to remember that hardly anyone, not even a trained actress, can keep up an act for ever. So Meghan may as well decide that the part of her she allows us to see is one that is both real and reliably predictable. Take Princess Diana. The public\u0027s impression of Diana as a gutsy woman doing her best to help those in need — while raising two sons and fulfilling exaggerated expectations as a royal role model — was, as I saw for myself, essentially accurate.People liked what they saw, believed it to be authentic and wanted more of it.ONE THING YOU SHOULD NEVER DOIn a lifetime of royal service, Meghan cannot expect always to please. She should think long and carefully, however, before reaching for the race card as a response to unfavourable news stories.Her erse ancestry is a positive asset for the House of Windsor, as its members and supporters are well aware. But it would be tragic if Meghan or her husband got into the habit of firing ethnic warning shots at the very same media that will reliably trumpet all their good work for years to come.STEER CLEAR OF POLITICSMeghan should make an early vow to avoid all activity or communication that might be interpreted as a comment on politics or public policy. Her reputation won\u0027t survive theatrical interventions in areas that rightly belong to elected politicians.So her widely advertised support for Democratic politics in the U.S. is a piece of personal baggage that must now be jettisoned. The sacred royal duty of political neutrality doesn\u0027t end at the shores of the kingdom.          Top priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royaltySEEK OUT THE BEST ADVICEThe Royals can choose from a limitless smorgasbord of advice — good, bad and downright dangerous. Ultimately, it\u0027s where Meghan chooses to turn for it that will determine much of her success or failure as a princess.Diana didn\u0027t always choose her advisers wisely. By the time she gave a self-sabotaging interview to the BBC\u0027s Panorama, she had an increasing tendency to seek advice from those who saw her as a useful vehicle for their own agendas.Sadly, they encouraged her to portray herself as a victim, rather than as the strong, influential woman I knew her to be.NEVER COMPLAIN, NEVER EXPAINThe Queen has demonstrated over the course of a lifetime that modern monarchy works best when it sticks to the old rule: \u0027Never complain, never explain.\u0027Prince Charles favours a different tactic, drawing criticism for what has been seen as an unwise amount of complaining and an un-royal amount of explaining.Even Harry\u0027s mother was rather too fond of both — although, in Diana\u0027s defence, she may have learned it from her husband.The public doesn\u0027t always respond well to complaints from those who have virtually unlimited resources and plenty of privacy. LEAVE YOUR SHOWBIZ DAYS BEHIND YOUTop priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royalty.Meghan may find that she can\u0027t go to her local shop on Kensington High Street without causing a minor riot. With that kind of profile, it\u0027s all too easy to think your very existence is cause for celebration.For Meghan, who has devoted so much energy to acquiring celebrity, the task of distinguishing between fame she\u0027s earned and fame she has acquired through Harry may be particularly hard. So, if she hasn\u0027t worked it out yet, now is the time to get it clear in her own mind.Get it wrong and she may never be forgiven.Meghan is particularly vulnerable in this respect because there\u0027ll always be sceptics ready to question whether her marriage is a love story or just part of a long-running fame campaign. Although many of the perks of royalty and celebrity are identical, the defining difference is that celebrity lifestyles are won, while royal privileges are granted.They exist in return for a life devoted to service, with lots of visible, unenviable duty and the appearance of sacrifice.Meghan may have already worked out that huge public warmth is directed at Harry and would be shared by anyone he chose to marry.So, even more than most royal newcomers, she\u0027ll be judged by her success as the never-failing source to her husband of strength, comfort, encouragement and wisdom.If Meghan allows doubt to grow that she is anything less than devoted to her man, his family and her obligations to her adopted country, then she may not have the luxury of any second chances.          \u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animalsKEEP OPINIONS TO YOURSELFBeing royal means that you will automatically always be heard, even when you just whisper.It\u0027s a magical power, given to very few and earned by even fewer.Unlike a struggling actress, a princess will be listened to respectfully and in silence, bar a few polite laughs at the right moments.This readily given approval can all too easily give the speaker an inflated and dangerously misleading perception of her own oratory and intellect.The Royal Family usually does best when it follows the example of the Queen.Despite having a powerful platform on which to share her views, insights, big ideas, wishes and prejudices, Her Majesty has resolutely kept her opinions to herself. AVOID CUDDLY ANIMALSCentral to Diana\u0027s success as a humanitarian was her instinct for what made best use of both her status and her compassion.She focused on causes that resonate in the public mind.Her sons have developed their own distinctive and admirable style. But one area where they\u0027ve taken a very different tack is in their promotion of conservation, especially in Africa.\u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animals.The most eloquent speech on the evils of the ivory trade will still do little to boost Meghan\u0027s profile.AND FINALLY...REAP THE REWARDSThe best news for Meghan, for Harry and for an expectant British public is that if she gets it right, the reward will be the secure evolution of the great institution that has welcomed her — and two lives made complete by their service to humanity.  Adapted from The Meghan Factor by Patrick Jephson, published by Bombardier Books, priced £11.22 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/12/00/4C1E329A00000578-0-image-a-24_1526079816392.jpg","title":"Terrified tourists run cover Disney parade","story":"    Video of the incident shows the head of the animatronic beast completely engulfed in fire, moving towards the crowd as black smoke billows to the sky          The attraction is Maleficent\u0027s dragon and part of the Magic Kingdom\u0027s daily Festival of Fantasy parade located in Liberty SquareMaleficent, the self-proclaimed \u0027Mistress of All Evil,\u0027 is a \u0027dark fairy\u0027 who first made her appearance in the Disney animated classic \u0027Sleeping Beauty\u0027 released in 1959.The fire was extinguished by a park employee and the area was cleared for tourists shortly thereafter.

Senior party figures said the Lords had gone too far, with amendments wrecking the Government’s EU legislation.Tory ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith warned of a ‘reckoning’ and a ‘total overhaul’.The backlash was sparked by 14 amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill, including peers voting to keep Britain in the Single Market and to axe the fixed date for Brexit.Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski said ‘out-of-control’ peers had tried to overturn the result of the EU referendum of June 2016, and abolition of the House of Lords should be in his party’s next manifesto.He added: ‘The time has come to have a root-and-branch reform.

More than a dozen fissures oozing lava have opened in the ground. Adding to the distress, of the 36 structures destroyed, 26 were homes.And now, scientists are warning that an explosive eruption may occur at the summit crater within weeks.Tina Neal, the scientist-in-charge of the U.S. Geological Survey\u0027s Hawaiian Volcanoes Observatory, said geologists don\u0027t expect the summit eruption to be life-threatening so long as people stay out of the national park. Volcano and other nearby communities may be showered by pea-sized fragments or dusted with nontoxic ash but they aren\u0027t expected to get hit by large boulders, she said.Robert Hughes, the owner of Aloha Junction Bed and Breakfast in Volcano, said he\u0027s had \u0027tons\u0027 of cancellations since Wednesday when geologists first warned of the explosive eruption.But Hughes, a 45-year resident of the village of some 2,500 people, suspects he\u0027ll soon hear from adventurers and photographers who want to see the eruption up close.\u0027I\u0027m not too worried about it because I\u0027ve lived here so long and I\u0027ve seen it go through lots of different episodes,\u0027 Hughes said.

Coney is anticipating more depending on what happens.There are also further potential risks where lava has been erupting 25 miles  east of the crater in Leilani Estates. Scientists said the molten rock there could start moving faster if fresher, hotter magma emerges from the ground.Neal said a chemical analysis of the lava that\u0027s erupted since last week indicated it\u0027s from magma that had been stored in the ground since a 1955 eruption. It\u0027s been sluggish and somewhat cooler as a result, she said. But Kilauea could release hotter, faster-moving and more voluminous lava because magma has moving into the area from further up the volcano, she said.

But where is the hope?A woman, pregnant by rape, is denied an abortion, legally detained and subjected to a forced caesarean. A woman on low income wants to leave her controlling partner but can’t, because a government policy designed to “prevent family breakdown” means all their benefits are paid into his account. A woman reports a sexual assault, but the police don’t believe her, so they prosecute her for making a false allegation, while her attacker remains free to attack more victims. Girls are systematically groomed into prostitution, and police ignore their abusers. A man boasts on tape that he can “grab” women “by the pussy”: he is elected president. These are all things that happened in Ireland, the UK and the US over the last decade.As the women of the Saturday Night Live cast sang in their musical response to men shocked by the revelations of #MeToo: “Welcome to hell,  This isn’t news.  Our situation’s been a nuisance since we got boobs.” From the theocratic abuse of girls in the Boko Haram-controlled regions of west Africa, to the torture porn-inspired murder of journalist Kim Wall by Peter Madsen, the world as it is offers such a rich variety of nightmares for women that it seems superfluous for fiction to devise ever more horrifying worlds that could be. But no matter: with a second season of the acclaimed TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale about to begin, the appetite for feminist dystopias shows no sign of abating, and publishers have proved more than willing to satisfy that demand.In Red Clocks by Leni Zumas, abortion is outlawed in the US and a “pink wall” prevents women from flitting to Canada. In Future Home of the Living God by Louise Erdrich, global warming seems to have precipitated a reproductive crisis: pregnant women are held in detention centres, and fertile women conscripted to carry embryos. The Growing Season by Helen Sedgwick imagines a world in which artificial wombs have become the norm. The Book of Joan by Lidia Yuknavitch takes place above a poisoned Earth, in a craft likened to an “idiotic space-condom”, where a handful of wealthy survivors mutate to sexlessless. In Sophie Mackintosh’s bewitching The Water Cure, women have been stricken with a terrible sensitivity that makes men toxic to them. Jennie Melamed’s Arthur C Clarke-nominated Gather the Daughters is set in a nightmarish closed community where fathers are expected to rape their prepubescent girls as a substitute for reproductive sex – a population control measure.Suffering sells, especially when it’s women who are doing the suffering, and as with any trend, the pressure is for each new iteration to outdo what came before. The results sometimes skirt absurdity: in Vox by Christina Dalcher, due to be published in August, women are fitted with bracelets that deliver electric shocks should they speak more than their allotted 100 words a day. And there’s more to come. At the London Book Fair in March, the big announcements were driven by stories of dreadful things happening to women: Joanne Ramos’s The Farm, to be published by Bloomsbury next year, is set in an industrial surrogacy facility Vardø, by Kiran Millwood Hargrave, about 17th-century witch trials, was acquired by Picador for a six-figure sum after a 13‑way bidding war. In YA, the same fascination holds sway: Louise O’Neill’s Only Ever Yours, published in 2014, established the tone, revisiting The Handmaid’s Tale for the teen market.Atwood’s 1985 novel endures as a touchstone because its power to shock has never faded. Limiting herself to technology that existed and events that had already happened, Atwood created a vision of patriarchal totalitarianism that has radicalised generation after generation of women readers. Updated to the present day in its TV adaptation, it has acquired new resonance. Commissioned before Trump’s presidency, but broadcast during it, The Handmaid’s Tale has become an instantly recognisable reference point. Feminists have dressed in handmaid costumes to protest anti-abortion legislation fashion designers have sent handmaid chic down their runways.Yet with season two already airing in the US and about to begin on Channel 4, some viewers have started to sound their discomfort about the levels of brutality in the drama. Season one, cleaving fairly closely to the novel, had a known arc of pain for Offred. Season two, loosed from its source material, has the potential for unlimited unpleasantness in Gilead. New York magazine called it “a ceaseless cavalcade of grisly feminist torture porn to rival our greatest misogynist auteurs”, and wondered whether this was justifiably shocking given the subject matter, or merely sadism.The Handmaid’s Tale effectively inaugurated feminist dystopia as a genre, and as the feminist dystopia has flourished, its opposite – the feminist utopia – has faded away. Margaret Cavendish’s 17th‑century The Blazing World, Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s 1915 novella Herland, Ursula K Le Guin’s The Left Hand of Darkness (1969) and Joanna Russ’s The Female Man (1975) all offered no-places where being female no longer meant being inferior. Revisiting these what-ifs is invigorating. In The Left Hand’s imagined world of Gethen, for example, there are no male and female humans: instead, every inidual is capable of ovulation and insemination, and takes each role situationally. In such a world, writes Le Guin, there is “no ision of humanity into strong and weak halves, protectedprotective, dominantsubmissive, ownerchattel, activepassive”. It’s an invention that points to both the cruelty of existing human sex classes, and the possibility of a life unconstrained by them.One of the few novels to have revisited such imaginative scope in recent years is Naomi Alderman’s The Power. In Alderman’s novel, women evolve a specialised organ called the skein which allows them to deliver massive electric shocks, which in turn allows them to dominate men as men have historically dominated women. It’s gratifying to enter a world where women can patronise men with the breezy authority of the feared, and the novel’s reversals are deliciously revealing about our own society’s male default. It’s funny to read a lofty woman character tell a genuflecting male that his idea of a “world run by men” would be “surely a kinder, more caring and – dare I say it? – more sexy world than the one we live in”.But when male protagonist Tunde describes what it is to be the inferior sex class, it’s shocking to hear such words from a man’s mouth. Only when you see a man being treated as women are treated, do you understand how very far we are from the radical notion that women are people. Yet The Power isn’t exactly a manifesto for change. In an extract from its future matriarchy’s religious text The Book of Eve, we’re told: “The shape of power is always the same.” When men have power, they use it over women when women have power, they use it over men. The prospect of a society that isn’t defined by a sex-class system is a hazy impossibility here.Of course, that criticism suggests that a novel has some obligation to be a manifesto for change, which raises the prickly issue of what it means for a work of art to be feminist anyway. For Atwood (Alderman’s mentor during the writing of The Power), this has always been a point of contention, and her relationship with both the label “feminist” and the movement as a whole has long been diffident. In a 2017 op-ed for the New York Times, she answered the question of whether The Handmaid’s Tale is a feminist novel:If you mean an ideological tract in which all women are angels andor so victimized they are incapable of moral choice, no. If you mean a novel in which women are human beings – with all the variety of character and behavior that implies – and are also interesting and important, and what happens to them is crucial to the theme, structure and plot of the book, then yes. In that sense, many books are ‘feminist’.It’s an answer that neatly shrugs off the deadening demand to make propaganda of her novel, but it’s also not really so much of an answer as a slipping between two straw feminisms. Feminism is neither the claim that women are perfect, nor is it anything that happens to be about women: it’s a movement to dismantle a system in which men systematically hold power over women and exploit them economically, sexually and (as The Handmaid’s Tale explores most obviously) reproductively.Part of that movement has always been what’s called “consciousness raising”, in which women share their experiences and affirm the nature of the problem. The boom of feminist dystopias seems to fit exactly that description – they are identifying problems, sometimes with satirical exaggeration, and giving readers the relief of recognition. But consciousness raising is a first stage, only meaningful when it forms the basis for co‑ordinated action, and as political and cultural commentator Helen Lewis has pointed out, contemporary feminism has shown incredible strength in consciousness raising but much less conviction when it comes to concrete aims.There are vital campaigns and notable successes (the Repeal the Eighth Amendment campaign to remove Ireland’s brutal restrictions on abortion, for example, and Caroline Criado-Perez’s work on female representation), but while high-profile movements such as the Everyday Sexism project and #MeToo have unambiguously established that we have a sexism and sexual harassment problem, they haven’t yet coalesced around a solution. The same predicament – an acute sense of what’s wrong, an impasse when it comes to ways of righting it – characterises much of the current literature of feminist dystopia.That tendency manifests itself in a few ways. Sedgwick’s The Growing Season prods thoughtfully at whether artificial uteruses would provide the ultimate liberation from sex roles, or leave women even more vulnerable to male coercion. With reproduction outsourced from the female body, women are no longer stereotyped into “care” roles: a male receptionist is as unremarkable as a female executive. But male violence persists, and the external wombs offer a new target for it. “We have invented a whole new form of abuse. We have given men the ultimate power over women,” bemoans the feminist inventor of “pouch”. But these big ideas are sidestepped as the novel shifts into conspiracy-thriller mode and, in something of a cheat, establishes both internal and external gestation as equally valid choices. (It says something about how hollow “choice” alone is as a feminist aim that Sedgwick must conjure this unlikely equilibrium to make it convincing.)Dalcher’s novel Vox lands some punches about the way female socialisation is simply the process of women becoming habituated to violent consequences – protagonist Jean observes her five-year-old daughter’s deft acquisition of feminine silence with horror – but arrives at a climax that’s as much an act of wish fulfilment as EL James’s Fifty Shades Freed. Jean not only defeats the patriarchy, but also runs away with a sexy Italian linguist. It’s a victory of sorts, but one that answers none of the questions that Dalcher raises about language, power and consent. In Erdrich’s Future Home of the Living God, narrator Cedar’s desperate flight from the authorities who want to take her baby and control her body is only a small sidestep from the reality of reproductive coercion for Native American women, who have suffered forced sterilisation and the removal of their children (Erdrich, like Cedar, belongs to the Ojibwe tribe). There is no way to write a satisfying conclusion to this situation. Where The Handmaid’s Tale (the novel) avoided both dishonest rescue and grinding misery by abruptly cutting off Offred’s story, Future Home presses on into paralysing bleakness. The underground railroad of midwives that protected Cedar fails, and it ends with her captured and her baby taken: “I wait in my cell for my next pregnancy,” she writes to the child that she will never know. “Where will you be, my darling, the last time it snows on earth?”Such finality can pose as hard-hitting, while actually luxuriating in female pain. Erdrich dodges that trap, but some feminist dystopias don’t. In O’Neill’s Only Ever Yours, girls are raised as “Eves”, scrupulously inculcated into femininity so they become pleasing wives for the ruling class of men. Those who fail are shunted down the caste system of women until, at the very bottom of the heap, they are sent “Underground” for termination. In one gruelling passage, main character Freida is punished for an infraction by being locked in her room, where the walls are screens which show on a loop her public shaming on national TV.It’s a scene that captures the self-loathing of the adolescent girl magnified by social media, but a reflection is not the same as a critique. Reading this, with its precise focus on weight and appearance, seems more likely to reinforce a young woman’s anxieties than to offer her a decisive debunking of the beauty myth. The conclusion has Freida embracing her end in the Underground with an almost erotic passion: “The needle sinks into my skin, the liquid whispering, forget, forget, to my blood … I am ready to feel nothing, forever.” Contra Atwood, feminism is not about idealising women, and nor is it about simply representing them, but both those options seem vastly preferable to a kind of “feminism” that offers consolation in self-destruction.If the truly feminist dystopia must honestly portray women’s struggles without sensationalising their pain, and dramatise a political analysis without falling into leaden sloganeering, then maybe such a thing can never exist. After all, one of the reasons for Atwood to be wary of the “feminist” label is that it’s so often an extra standard applied only to women writers – a standard they will fail, since the purpose of most standards applied only to women is to ensure that women will never be good enough.But there is fiction that understands women’s oppression, recognises women’s subjectivity, has the imagination to stress-test how the worst case might play out, and the hope that we might pick some kind of better future from it in the end. A feminist dystopia, in other words, must have a little of the feminist utopia to it. In Red Clocks, the horror of the “Pink Wall” (a scenario that is more or less fact for women in Ireland without passports, or women in conservative American regions who lack the resources to transport themselves across state lines) twines with a moving vision of female resistance, as Zumas’ characters learn to look to each other for aid. There is a bond that stretches not just between women but back through time: “Thousands of years in the making, fine tuned by women in the dark creases of history, helping each other,” thinks one. Sisterhood is also salvaged in The Water Cure, albeit somewhat disturbingly. By the end, its women characters have killed a man to protect their closed world: they leave him on the beach as a message to other interlopers that “this is no place”, and their ambiguous utopia has been preserved. The Book of Joan, with its strange and looping sense of time (the narrator, Christine, and her adversary, Jean de Men, are revisitings of the medieval proto-feminist Christine de Pizan and the hyper-misogynist author of The Romance of the Rose), can’t exactly be said to offer progressivism: how can you progress when history is collapsing on itself? But there is something hopeful in the claim it stakes for a return to acknowledging materiality in politics, and not living on the unsustainable expropriation of either planet or body: “The body is a real place,” says girl-rebel Joan as she marshals the land-bound survivors into an army. “A territory as vast as Earth.”Then there is Octavia Butler’s superb Parable of the Sower (1993). On an overheated and resource-poor near-future Earth where women are one more resource to be exploited, protagonist Lauren leads a straggling band of pilgrims through a violent wilderness with a dream of starting something new. That something is Earthseed: part religion, part interstellar colonisation project, “the ultimate human change short of death … a destiny we’d better pursue if we hope to be anything other than smooth-skinned dinosaurs”. While the world we live in is still no place for women, feminism needs such dreams of better things. Enumerating our wounds, by itself, will not carry us to a place beyond harm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f707ebe12e6fabd3a7b63a29ced2a2478544eb30/0_139_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7835a1249a5a5493c363af32224def77","title":"racism visa india passport ryanair montenegro","story":"UK-based charity worker says ground staff’s refusal to let her fly was ‘frightening and humiliating’A London-based charity worker, who was denied boarding a Ryanair flight while on a work trip to Montenegro, has accused airport staff of “racism” and “making up their own immigration rules as they go along”.Neha Kagal, who has an Indian passport and a British visa and residence permit, says she was left angry and humiliated after boarding staff at Stansted airport refused to let her enter the flight last March on the basis that she did not have a visa for the Schengen area of Europe.Her case is the latest example of airlines wrongly banning people from flights to avoid potential fines from the destination country.The Embassy of Montenegro in London had categorically told Kagal that she didn’t need a Schengen visa – and has since confirmed this in writing – but ground handling staff refused to listen.She says she and a colleague were forced to stand aside as other passengers were allowed to board. To compound their frustration, she claims airport staff told her that they had to be very “wary of people with blue (Indian) passports” and told her that it didn’t matter what the embassy said as “there was no way she was going to Montenegro on a Ryanair flight”.She says: “Racist Ryanair apparently have their own immigration rules.”Only after  Money intervened would the airline admit it was wrong. Kagal, who works for the UK-based Imkaan charity – dedicated to addressing violence against black and minoritised women and girls – was supposed to be flying to Montenegro with a colleague as part of a United Nations project helping these women fight sexual exploitation.She passed through baggage check-in, where her boarding pass was stamped stating her “visa check” had been done. “But when I got to the gate they demanded to see a Schengen visa,” she says. “I told them that I had contacted the Montenegrin embassy to confirm my visa requirements. While at the airport, I even went so far as to call up the embassy to reconfirm, but the staff wouldn’t have it. It was embarrassing and humiliating.”Given the nature of the work, the charity insists its workers only travel in pairs, so her colleague could not travel, either. The pair had booked hotel rooms, and hired interpreters, both of which had to be paid for despite their no-show. “It was intimated that they had refused me ‘in case’ I needed to be deported back to the UK. If so, it would cost them £20,000 and so they couldn’t take the ‘risk’,” she says.“I was to meet survivors of violence, working in very small NGOs, who had taken time out of their busy schedules to meet with us. In the current climate of hatred and intolerance, I find the behaviour of corporations like Ryanair abhorrent and frightening.”A Ryanair spokesperson says: “This customer was denied boarding in error by our third-party handling agent, Swissport, which has since taken necessary steps to ensure this will not reoccur. We have since contacted the customer to apologise for the confusion and inconvenience caused, and have resolved the matter directly.”It has agreed to pay her the costs she incurred, plus €400 (£352)EU-mandated compensation, totalling £920.Swissport tells the : “We can confirm that a passenger was held back from boarding a flight due to a staff member’s misunderstanding of the required travel documents. We take any complaints of this nature extremely seriously and are contacting the customer to apologise for the inconvenience caused. An investigation is ongoing. Staff have been briefed, and we are working to ensure processes are in place which mitigate against situations like this occurring in the future.”In March, the Observer reported on the case of a family’s easyjet flight from Gatwick to Berlin, where the wife held a British passport and the husband, from the Middle East, had a travel document issued by the Home Office.Easyjet refused to let the man board the flight, insisting he needed a visa to travel to Germany and refused a refund. When shown that the visa wasn’t necessary, it then claimed to be following Gatwick procedures, but Gatwick denied this.Only when Observer consumer champion Anna Tims intervened, and six weeks after their ordeal, did easyJet admit it was wrong, apologised and paid compensation.Qantas banned a British couple from boarding a flight in New Zealand to Beijing in March, where they were going to stay for five nights before heading back to the UK. Check-in staff at Christchurch airport wrongly insisted that the couple needed a visa for China prior to boarding the flight.Yet China has introduced new rules which allow travellers to go through immigration and stay in a number of cities without a visa if they can prove that they will leave China within 144 hours of arriving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dadf9b7c0c0ff56be693f61ae7a12d8fd425cec1/0_39_2812_1687/master/2812.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=502f9dbee5d2bef974a979a741060b5a","title":"malaysia hope is the biggest winner as power passes peacefully","story":"Mahathir Mohamad’s victory is like Nigel Farage running for Remain. But it shows anything is possible in a country long racked by ision and graftHow can you explain what has happened in Malaysia? How can you explain the sheer jubilant wonder of seeing Mahathir Mohamad come back to save the country from the slippery slope he had painstakingly constructed – someone who built so much of modern Malaysia, but also turned the very concept of electoral reform into anathema?It’d be like the spectre of Ronald Reagan returning to take on Trump, according to one meme doing the rounds, though Nigel Farage popping up to run a latter-day Remain campaign may be closer in spirit. But analogies sputter into irrelevance here – the plot twists in Malaysian politics are closer to those in professional wrestling than anything else in real life.It’s surreal. It’s been surreal since that endless night of 9 May, as the country waited and watched into the wee hours, long past the time every previous election had been reduced to incumbents and despair. Mahathir claimed victory, but this is Malaysia, where gerrymandering appears with the same sledgehammer subtlety as the disappearance of US$3.5bn worth of development money in the 1MDB scandal. Surely this couldn’t be happening. Surely anything could happen. And it did.After yet another delay, Mahathir was finally sworn in as prime minister late on 10 May. There he was, 92 years old, smaller in body yet colossal in stature, acid tongue rendered playful by victory: a particular highlight was an aside to the press pack that they “may ask questions, but in a very orderly fashion. Please remember I was the dictator”. Then there was his vanquished opponent, Najib Razak, issuing apologies with a compelling mix of dignity and utter revisionism. But most surprising of all has been the grace of concession from a government long addicted to dirty tricks, and the peace that has followed in its wake.There is a reason for this. Mahathir is a known quantity these are uncharted waters being navigated by the same captain. He’s also a man, and Malay, and Muslim, a palatable alternative for the rural voters who kept the Barisan Nasional coalition in power for so many decades. Malaysia was ready for a change of government, but other changes will take time.But, as the past three days have shown, anything is now possible. Wan Azizah, a savvy politician who is married to Anwar, is the country’s first female deputy prime minister. Mahathir has promised to cede power to Anwar, for whom a full pardon has been secured from the king. Across the country, election materials are being lovingly kept as souvenirs. They are mementoes for the citizens who broke their backs for decades to get to this point, who spent time and money and effort to vote and act as polling agents, and reminders of the opposition politicians who put egos and partisanship aside to run as an alliance. Malaysia has had its first democratic transition of power since its independence in 1957. That’s the lasting beauty of Pakatan Harapan, the new governing coalition it quite literally means hope, a suddenly abundant commodity in a country for so long starved of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fa88acd9207badf2abd10cd2e7de23130f761db/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=242d823170a95e7b4f65c4e6479b5fc9","title":"silence golden cinema aspergers tolerance","story":"Audience members turned on a woman with Asperger’s who was causing a distraction. How would you have reacted?In 1962, for the first and I hope last time in my life, I created a brief sensation in the theatre. The playhouse was the Lyceum in Edinburgh, and the play was a touring production of Billy Liar, which Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall had adapted from Waterhouse’s novel and which I’d first seen in London the year before, soon after Tom Courtenay replaced Albert Finney in the starring role. It had made a big impression on me, perhaps the first play ever to do so, and when it turned up on our doorstep I insisted my parents went to see it, and also bought a pair of tickets for a school friend and myself to a Saturday matinee a few days later.The parental excursion turned out not to be a success: my father was surprised and angered that Billy’s father swore so much, bloody-this and bloody-that and though this hardly qualifies as “strong language” now, it sounded daring enough at the time. (An elderly friend of the family, a Northumbrian schoolmistress, had never forgiven George Bernard Shaw for Eliza Doolittle’s astonishing “Not bloody likely!” in Pygmalion.)Possibly infected by the same daring spirit, when my friend and I attended the matinee we did something that neither of us had planned. The Lyceum in those days clung on to an old tradition and played the national anthem before every performance. A piano and a violin struck up and the audience got to its feet. “Let’s just sit,” my friend said. So we sat.A man in the row behind said, “They must be Irish nationalists.” People turned round to look and turned back to whisper disparagingly among themselves. The anthem seemed to go on for ever, but at last it was over, the curtain went up and the play began. At the interval my friend suggested that we limped stiff-legged up the aisle to buy an ice-cream, to show that we had sat through the anthem for, as it were, medical reasons so that people who had mistaken us for disloyal young Irishmen would discover that in fact we were Douglas Baders. But I don’t remember that we actually did limp. We hadn’t the courage to be situationists. Normal service as an obedient member of the audience was quickly resumed, and the next time we went to see a film we stood as usual through the anthem at the end of the show, disrespectfully putting an arm into our coat-sleeves rather than coming to full attention as the union flag fluttered onscreen.Like most people of my postwar generation, I learned to belong to an audience on weekly trips to the cinema. Saturday morning shows for children permitted a degree of turbulence in the front stalls, where the squealing grew loud at the violent knockabout of the Three Stooges, and orange peel could be thrown at one’s enemies. But long before adolescence these bad habits fell away, to be replaced by a respect for what we saw, that ran from the adverts to the main feature via the trailers, the Movietone newsreel, and Edgar\u0026nbspLustgarten telling stories from the files of Scotland\u0026nbspYard. There was no applause – why would you applaud an image? Today when clapping happens in art cinemas at the end of much-loved old films (It’s a Wonderful Life, Casablanca), it often dies quickly, as though people have suddenly awoken to the fact that the flesh-and-blood versions of James Stewart and Humphrey Bogart haven’t really been walking among them.The cinema is a spell – the theatre too, to a lesser extent. It happens in the dark. The real world outside the hall recedes with the dimming of the lights. Nothing must break the conspiracy between film and audience, which means that, if laughter is appropriate, the ideal audience laughs when you laugh, and at much the same volume and length, but keeps quiet the rest of the time. Other reactions are of course permissible – tears, shock – but their great virtue is their silent expression. The well-known enemies of enjoyment are the rustling sweet wrapper, the crunching crisp packet, the hissing drinks can, the chatty couple, the voluble drunk.I can see that there’s something both tyrannical and puritanical to these conventions, but as a subscriber to them I have to wonder how I (and I imagine many others) would have reacted during two recent and widely reported incidents. In the first, a 25-year-old artist and animator, Tamsin Parker, was forcibly removed from a screening at the British Film Institute for laughing too loudly during Sergio Leone’s The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. According to another cinemagoer, she had been “dragged out shouting, ‘I’m sorry, I have Asperger’s!’”According to her mother, this was her favourite film and her outing to the BFI with two friends had been a birthday treat that had ended in distress and “floods of tears”. According to the BFI, its staff had faced a “challenging and complex situation”, which may be true, because while some of the audience applauded her removal and one man (also evicted) called her “a bitch”, others left the cinema in apparent disgust at her treatment.The second incident occurred at the Swan theatre, Worcester, during a matinee of Stephen Sondheim’s fairytale-based musical Into the Woods, after a woman began to “shush” another audience member, 25-year-old Harry Boniface, whose father, Martin, was acting in the production. The senior Boniface described his son as “non-verbal” with “profound and multiple” learning difficulties. He was making animal noises – the musical includes a cow and a wolf – and left with his support worker when the shushing woman in the audience eventually asked him to go.The BFI is contrite, promising to look at “additional provisions and staff training” to accommodate “all the needs of our customers”. The Swan theatre was disappointed that “in these changing times … a member of the audience should take such an unenlightened view”. Martin Boniface said he would “love for people to be more tolerant and more accepting”, and who also would not hope for that? Better staff training, more public awareness and kindness, more autism-friendly screenings and performances of the kind proposed by the National Autistic Society. These things are a remedy of sorts, but in the end the great immovable is the selfish demand of the audience to hear and see a film, a play or a concert without the intrusion of the imperfect world they have temporarily left behind.One of the best scenes in Ruben Östlund’s satire The Square, which won last year’s Palme d’Or at Cannes, shows an American conceptual artist and his Scandinavian interlocutor having a laboured and reverential conversation in front of a polite audience of well-to-do Swedes. Some unintelligible shouting interrupts the American when he is describing his mission to explore how the “space in a gallery relates to the space inside one’s own head”. It’s a man with Tourette’s, and eventually he makes himself clear. “Garbage,” he says, the implication being that he sees through the nonsense that has fooled everyone else.Now imagine a similar scene in a concert hall – say the Wigmore in London. The audience has paid £60 each to hear the chamber music of Schubert. Someone in the hall begins to show the symptoms of Tourette’s. Unlike the man in Östlund’s film, he has no role as a truth-teller or idiot savant. The audience already knows the truth about Schubert. What is to be done?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e45d518ca0ffd53e31e36ebc66c989386ce1f67/1092_514_3591_2154/master/3591.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70ce1edb33ae5584073159fbe6d8aaab","title":"turn 40 what learned hadley freeman","story":"Here’s what I’ve learned“I’m gonna be 40! Someday!” Sally sobs in When Harry Met Sally. I have long considered Sally to be my cinematic alter ego so I think of this upcoming week as Sally Albright’s Midlife Crisis, because this Tuesday I turn 40. Not someday any more – now.I’m like Sally in pretty much every regard, from the fussy eating to the dislike of wagon wheel coffee tables, but on this subject we differ. I’m genuinely excited about my 40s. My teens were a mess of hormones and mental health issues. My 20s were lost in a vortex of terrible boyfriends and worse drugs. My 30s were a dream, and by “dream” I mean one of those anxiety dreams that turns your bed into a river of sweat, as I was hit by personality-altering fertility panics. My 40s are the decade when I can just live, unencumbered by the neuroses that, in my case, were largely just a symptom of being young and insecure. As Danny Glover would say, I’m\u0026nbsptoo old for that shit.Being 40 means I know stuff. More than when I was 30, and even more than when I was 20. I like that. I’ve spent four decades getting pretty much everything wrong, and now that I know the below I\u0026nbspreckon I should get everything right in the next four.1 As you age you gain so much more than you loseI am not one of those women whose looks improve with age. My cousin recently posted a photo of us in our 20s and I spent three solid days staring at it, not even breaking for meals. “Look how much prettier I once was!” I shouted at passers-by. “Those bright eyes! That unlined forehead! And I had no idea!” Sure, I could weep for all the boys I could have kissed back then but felt too ugly to do so, but those boys were never really all that. And I’m glad I never thought of my looks as my USP, because it means my sense of self is not bound up in them. Instead, I’ve got better at the things that matter to me. I’m more self-confident, which has made me a more stable person and better writer. I no longer judge myself by how others see me, or put up with men patronising me because I am femalehave a funny namewould choose the works of Steve Guttenberg as my Mastermind subject. In\u0026nbspshort, I don’t assume everyone else knows better than me, because experience has taught me I invariably know better than the men who patronise me. And that is worth the wrinkled forehead.Yes, it’s harder to get pregnant over 40 than it is under 30, and yes, women should know this. But the way we are obsessively harangued about this is a trick to make us turn off our intelligence and become baby-obsessed just as our male colleagues are making career strides. When I hit my mid-30s I started, quite frankly, to go mad. I\u0026nbspdated men who in normal circumstances I wouldn’t have spat on if they were on fire and I stayed with them in the belief they were “my last chance” (they weren’t). One night one of these idiots dumped me and, crazed with self-loathing, I went to a party thrown by one of my bosses, where I\u0026nbsppromptly got wrecked, was caught taking drugs in the loo by said boss and then insisted everyone watch me dance to Chaka Khan. Are\u0026nbspthese the actions of a sane person? They are not. So be aware of your options, but don’t become obsessed by them and don’t feel powerless before them. Most of all, don’t do drugs at your boss’s party. Learn from your elders!3 Don’t hide behind your youthI started writing for this paper when I was 20 – yes, as in half a lifetime ago – and because I spent so long working with people older than me I got a little too used to thinking of myself as that stock figure, The Comedy Chaotic Young Person. This meant that I often coasted (of course I came to work hungover – I’m basically a child!), underestimated myself (I can’t possibly write a serious article, I’m basically a child!) and thought my novelty value lay in my youth (Me! Basically a child!). I am definitely a grown-ass woman now so I can’t hide behind the smokescreen of youth and inexperience any more. Instead, I take personal responsibility for what I say and do. This, I honestly believe, is good for the soul.4 Finally, do everythingWell, not everything (see point 2). But the only real regrets I have about my youth are the things I didn’t do because of self-doubt: the jobs abroad I didn’t take, the books I didn’t write. Do it all now, young women, not because you won’t have time when you’re older (although you won’t), but because you shouldn’t let self-doubt hold you back from anything, and it holds too many of us back from everything. And\u0026nbspif there’s one thing I wish for my birthday, it’s that this no longer be true of the next generation. Happy birthday to all of us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8667bcdc96235f2dd8b2a19d5e7ac8dc87ff2823/0_339_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ac012bac40e3c146e965cf915916f41","title":"from babies bums to fatbergs how we fell out of love with wet wipes","story":"We now use 14,000 of the handy cloths every second - but they are increasingly clogging rivers and putting wildlife at risk. So how can we wean ourselves off them?On the eighth-floor isolation ward of London’s University College Hospital, nurses have two lines of defence against the spread of life-threatening diseases. First are the airtight double lobbies in every room. Second – and, arguably, more importantly – are the disinfectant wipes they rely on to prevent the spread of germs and viruses.For nurse consultant Annette Jeanes, the disposable flannels are a godsend that allow her and her staff, not only to protect themselves from superbugs such as C difficile and other viruses, but also to make the most of their time, a crucial factor in the National Health Service.“It’s hard to imagine a time when the NHS didn’t use wipes,” she declares as she surveys the length of T08 ward. “Our nurses are one of our greatest resources and we don’t have enough of them. Wipes have made their lives easier and freed them up to do other things.”Similar arguments could be heard the length and breadth of the UK this week after the government announced plans to address the worst effects of wet wipes following a host of revelations about the ubiquity of the throwaway towels. While the NHS – which is by far the biggest public sector user – can make a strong case for the necessity and benefits of disposable hygiene products, the picture is very different in wider society, where wipes can be more aptly described as a consumer luxury that chokes waterways and threatens wildlife.Until now, the rise of the wet wipe has been irrepressible its history a mirror of global inequality, consumerism and short-term thinking. In the 60 years since the first was deployed, usage has surged to an estimated 450bn a year - or about 14,000 every second.Market research suggests wipes and other throwaway hygiene items are near-perfect markers of haves versus have-nots. In poor nations, usage is close to zero. But once average salaries rise to $1,500 per month, women begin to buy sanitary products. From $3,500, parents are willing to spend on disposable nappies. Once incomes hit $8,000, people splash out on wipes.Age is also a factor. Younger generations whose bottoms were cleaned as babies are more inclined than their parents and grandparents to use wipes. Busy mums are the main market. In the US, 22 million Americans used pre-moist cloths 31 times or more within a week. Between 2005 and 2015, the surface area of non-woven wipes produced in Europe almost doubled.The supplanting of cloth napkins, cleaning rags and toilet paper began 60 years ago.The first pre-moistened, scented napkin was produced in a Manhattan loft in 1958 by a former cosmetics industry employee, Arthur Julius, who later convinced Col Harland Sanders that his finger-lickin’ chicken would sell better if messy eaters could clean up with the Wet-Nap® he had trademarked. Kentucky Fried Chicken has since given away close to a billion wipes. “Enough to reach halfway to the moon,” a spokesman claimed, omitting to mention that disposal will have to be an earthly operation and not a cosmic one.This is only a tiny fraction of the total. Tweaks to the chemical and manufacturing processes have led to alcohol swabs, baby wipes, airline refreshment towels, disinfecting tissues, antibacterials, makeup removers, insect-repellent towelettes and countertop cleaners.Julius’ company – Nice-Pak is still the market leader, churning out 150bn wipes per year – almost 5,000 a second. Rival firms spin out more than that number again, but the most modern products have little in common with the original.Fibres of the paper can now be woven, spun-laced, doused in sanitising isopropyl alcohol, scented, and preserved with anti-fungal agents such as methylisothiazolinone.But the fastest-growing market in recent years is for damp, chemically-treated alternatives to toilet paper, such as adult moist tissues, toddler care products and feminine hygiene wipes. Unlike baby wipes, they are designed to be flushable. Consumers do not appear to know the difference.As well as ugly, it is expensive. Blockages cost the UK about £100m every year, according to Water UK’s director of corporate affairs, Rae Stewart: “Water companies spend billions of pounds every year improving water and sewerage services in this country, but our sewers are just not designed to handle these new wipes which clog up the system. Sewer blockages end up costing the country about £100m every year so it’s clear that something needs to change.”This has contributed to a second wave of pollution of the Thames. Following the contamination of the industrial era, London’s river is now increasingly clogged with the detritus of the consumer age.Walk along the bank near Hammersmith or Barnes at low tide and many of the exposed rocks are flecked with wet wipes discharged through nearby sewer outlets. These are now the most common item of rubbish found on the riverside, overtaking plastic bottles and cotton buds. The citizen clean-up group Thames21 recently claimed wipes are reshaping the waterbed after finding 5,000 in an area half the size of a tennis court.Although some are supposed to be biodegradable, the risks do not go away when they break down. Kirsten Downer, campaigns officer for Thames21 fears for the herons and ducks she sees pecking on the dirty clumps in case they suffer the fate of fish. The problem has also spread along waterways towards the coast. Over the past 10 years, the Great British Beach Clean – an annual event in which volunteers collect rubbish from shorelines – has recorded a fifteenfold increase in the number of wet wipes. On average last year, they found one every five or six steps.The government’s promise of tough action on these single-use plastics has yet to be matched with deeds. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it is not planning a full ban on wet wipes, but says it will work with industry to develop plastic-free alternatives and examine which products are most at fault for sewer problems. Other countries are also taking steps. The European Union is investigating wet wipes as part of a wider study of ocean microplastics. Earlier this month, Australian authorities fined Pental $700,000 for falsely claiming its White King wipes were flushable.Industry leaders in other countries prefer to stress Britain’s exceptional circumstances, saying the problem here is one of sewers rather than products. “I see issues in the UK that we don’t have in the States, notably the presence of waste on the shoreline,” said Dave Rousse, president of the the US Association of the Nonwoven Fabrics Industry. “This suggests – with a high possibility – that sewers are opening out directly into rivers. The waste water is not being filtered.”Rather than a ban, he said the best solution was for better markings on packaging and more education of consumers so they can distinguish between more “flushable” wipes – which are made of cellulosic materials (which break up and sink) – and regular thermoplastic wipes (which bind and float). But many environmentalists and water authority officials are unimpressed by the distinction, and the higher price of the more biodegradable products puts off all but one in 10 buyers.Manufacturers are trying to develop greener products that use wood fibres and other natural materials. There are also calls for a universal ‘Bin it, don’t flush it’ logo on packaging, but the best way to ease the wipe problem is to use them less or stop completely. To help, Thames21 have issued a guide for plastic-free parenting. For the many iniduals and institutions that cannot be weaned, the best bet is to seek the most nature-friendly alternative and to discard items responsibly.At the University College Hospital, which gets through 90,000 packs of wipes each year, staff are trained to dispose carefully. Only used wipes contaminated by faeces, blood and bodily fluids and deemed to be ‘infectious waste’ are destroyed by incineration. All others are ‘macerated’ or pulped down and recycled.Specialist medical suppliers are also working on solutions without plastic. They will inevitably be more expensive, but Jeanes supports change: “I can’t see wipes disappearing from the NHS but it’s a good thing if we are questioning whether we can do things in a way that is better for the environment and reduces our own waste.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a310e813be9479ebcb7e830ee78c474f6a98d526/0_123_2096_1258/master/2096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b36d0d4aa74b34bacb0f4627e659755d","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A nesting stork, a rescued bobcat, and flamingos at sunset are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f1737db7f96f2f4a8e6bbe2198320a39c1db018/0_101_4457_2674/master/4457.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb25a031ce577c77352e59edd53e3a04","title":"cannes film festival 2018 roundup best of week one","story":"A lack of star power has left this year’s festival chaotic and uncertain, but that’s no bad thing, with exciting new leftfield talents vying for a place in the sunSpare a thought for the American tourist come to ogle celebrities at the 71st Cannes film festival. She’s craning her neck to see who’s on the red carpet, eagerly asking what movie is playing tonight. It’s clearly a big affair – the paparazzi have gone wild. But the crowd is too thick and the distance too great, and try as she might she can’t get her bearings.It falls to a French student to put her in the picture. “Tonight, it is an Egyptian film called Yomeddine,” he explains kindly. “It is about a man who lives in a leper colony. All his life inside a leper colony.”The tourist scans the kid’s face to make sure he’s not joking. It transpires he’s not, but she’s amused all the same. “Well how about that?” she says with a snort. “My one night in Cannes and it’s leprosy night.”It may even be that she’s underselling the thing. Believe some sections of the US media and you’d assume that every night is leprosy night that this event has turned unsound and unclean, a glamour-free irrelevance. As evidence, pundits point to the comparative dearth of big US pictures, a lack of star wattage and the holes in the programme left by the Netflix boycott. So the Cannes film festival opens under lowering clouds, buzzing with tension, all of its pieces torn loose and in play. I’m thinking this might be a blessing in disguise.Cannes needed a shake-up and by heavens, it’s happened. Last year’s edition felt cumbersome and conservative. This one is chaotic, uncertain and consequently more interesting. It used to be that the main competition was dominated by grandees. This time, the doors to the citadel seem to have been blown wide open. Yes, the lineup has made room for the likes of Spike Lee, Jean-Luc Godard and 2014 Palme d’Or winner Nuri Bilge Ceylan. But it also contains unfamiliar names such as Eva Husson, Yann Gonzalez and Ryusuke Hamaguchi, all of whom have presumably been selected on merit alone. So far at least, the glamour has largely been confined to the jury. The opening ceremony was a star-gled affair that saw jury members Kristen Stewart, Léa Seydoux and Ava DuVernay enthroned on white armchairs at the head of the stage while a sequin-bedecked Juliette Armanet sang The Windmills of Your Mind. But even these people, it seems, are determined to throw history in the dustbin. Or as jury president Cate Blanchett put it: “We’re trying to remove names and past and just deal with the present.”After all that, it would be nice to report that Cannes chose to open with some bold, insurrectionist masterpiece. Instead, the organisers plumped for Ashgar Farhadi’s Everybody Knows, a schematic potboiler that folds a kidnap plot in with a land dispute and then sits back to observe the ruination that follows. Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem deliver sterling performances as the ex-lovers in crisis, but the plot clanks and grinds and rather outstays its welcome.The critics, then, must look elsewhere for more exotic produce. Happily it’s not long till they find it. Cristina Gallego and Ciro Guerra’s Birds of Passage (which opens the directors’ fortnight) spins a fabulous origins tale, chasing the source of the Colombian drugs trade upriver to the homesteads of the indigenous Wayuu people and finding a fascinating new route through familiar narco-thriller terrain. I also liked Sergei Loznitsa’s Donbass, a rollicking, dangerous imp of a film that serves up nightmarish vignettes from the “People’s Republic of Ukraine”, although it is so pitiless and unremitting I’m not sure I could bring myself to sit through it again. And while we’re about it, let’s not discount AB Shawky’s Yomeddine, the Egyptian leprosy film. This manages to be winning and graceful and just the right side of cloying in its depiction of its middle-aged hero (played by non-professional actor Rady Gamal) turned loose from the colony and setting forth in search of home.Up in the gods of the vast concrete Palais, the critics gather to see The Eyes of Orson Welles, in which Mark Cousins leafs through the director’s sketchbooks to frame him as a primarily visual thinker. In so doing, Cousins sketches a tender, insightful portrait of his own. The Welles who emerges is a headstrong traveller, “mad for contact with the world”, who bounded out of Wisconsin, through Chicago, Ireland, Harlem and Morocco. Cousins revisits these haunts and finds them now bulldozed or derelict or altered beyond recognition. “Paradises don’t last,” he concludes, which may be precisely what made them paradises to begin with.Early mornings at Cannes are given over to the clean-up crews. They come pootling through town on electric carts to direct high-pressure hoses on the cobblestones and monuments until every street takes on a faint whiff of detergent. Most of the mess is just superficial spillage. But some stains, I suspect, will take longer to remove.Full credit to the festival for moving to accommodate the #MeToo movement. The organisers have hurriedly established a sexual harassment hotline and laid on various symposiums to promote the importance of women in film. But the persistent issue is that Cannes’s high-blown art sits cheek-by-jowl with the tawdrier elements of the entertainment industry, to the point where the two become inisible. The town remains – to adapt Graham Greene – a sunny place for shady men. There are oligarchs’ yachts lined up by the Palais, dead-eyed escorts in the lobby of five-star hotels and bacchanalian revels in the villas outside town.Up until last year, Harvey Weinstein presided over this stretch of coast. Now he, too, is being hastily rubbed out of history. And yet Weinstein was not some rogue interloper, the rapacious cane toad dropped into the garden, but merely the biggest and meanest of a particular breed of Cannes monster. Despite much-needed changes, the place remains a magnet for hucksters and hustlers and greedy, overgrown boys who regard every film set as their own personal sweet-shop. In the dazzling glare of the seafront cocktail reception, we look from the art-house producer to the bling-wearing gangster and struggle to work out just which is which.It’s dark in the cinema but it’s more joyous there, too. Leto, by the dissident Russian film-maker Kirill Serebrennikov, is a languorous, ravishing, dying fall of a film, spotlighting the fortunes of a new wave garage band in early-80s Leningrad. Our hero Mike (Roman Bilyk) has the shades and the songs, but he’s being gradually outpaced by the younger, smarter Viktor (Teo Yoo) and struggles to maintain his rock’n’roll lifestyle on a caretaker’s wage. In the end, something’s got to give.Serebrennikov largely shoves the plot to the sidelines to wallow, quite gorgeously, in the pungent atmosphere of the Soviet underground scene. His characters are in thrall to Blondie, Lou Reed and Iggy Pop in thrall to the transcendent possibilities of the music they love. “Wait!” shouts Mike at one point. “I’ve just had an indomitable idea of quite mind-blowing proportions.” This turns out to be an idea for a chord change.I’m filing Leto as my favourite competition film from Cannes’s opening days. It’s the perfect accompaniment to a festival in flux: young, raw and gauche, still finding its feet and groping towards glory. When the old order is failing, something needs to replace it. So bring on the unwashed and unclean, the lepers and punks. These are the runners and riders that have arrived to save Cannes.BlacKkKlansman (Spike Lee screening Tuesday) Spike Lee reckons he should have bagged the Palme d’Or for Do the Right Thing. Still smarting nearly 30 years on, he has another bite at the cherry with his fact-based account of an African American cop who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan. If he doesn’t win this time, the jury are advised to take cover.Dogman (Matteo Garrone Wednesday) The Italian film-maker Matteo Garrone scored a breakout hit with 2008’s Gomorrah, and advance word suggests Dogman might be equally fine. Billed as an “urban western”, it’s about a hapless dog groomer who takes on a psychotic former boxer who is terrorising the neighbourhood. We’re seeing this as High Noon by way of Best in Show.The House That Jack Built (Lars von Trier)Rocking up the Croisette like the prodigal son comes enfant terrible Lars von Trier. It’s seven years since the director was ejected from Cannes for jokingly saying he sympathised with Hitler, but don’t look to him to have reformed his disreputable ways. Von Trier’s latest is a serial killer story described by its creator as “a film that celebrates the idea that life is evil and soulless”.Happy As Lazzaro (Alice Rohrwacher Monday) Still only 35, Italian film-maker Alice Rohrwacher is set for her second visit to Cannes with this class-ide fable charting the friendship between a small-town peasant and the local aristocrat. Rohrwacher won the Grand Prix (traditionally seen as Cannes’ silver medal) for The Wonders back in 2014. She’ll be hoping to go one better this time.The Man Who Killed Don Quixote (Terry Gilliam closing film, Saturday) Might Cannes yet provide a happy ending for Terry Gilliam? The director first attempted to shoot The Man Who Killed Don Quixote back in 2000. Now it appears he’s finally done it. Only last weekend Gilliam suffered a minor stroke. But he’s now out of hospital and determined to attend. He wouldn’t want to miss this premiere for the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fca4508e950c2d1fa99b9498cb140c17df789f5/183_387_2990_1794/master/2990.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026amp;s=8a018a6f8753f7630a2a578ffbabb2be","title":"world cup stunning moments france implode","story":"In open rebellion against their manager, France’s 2010 squad self-destructed as Thierry Henry watched impassivelyIn the first of these two encounters, in which Les Bleus actually showed a surprising degree of enterprise and imagination, the armband had been given to Patrice Evra – who’d kept it on when Thierry entered the fray in the second half. Domenech poo-poohed the idea that this was proof of Henry’s declining status within the squad. But more people would’ve been inclined to take the manager at his word if a French TV network hadn’t found out that he’d visited Thierry in Barcelona shortly before this game, in order to strike a deal that would preserve both men’s self-regard and ambitions.True to his obsession with secrecy, Domenech denied it had been the case, only for Henry to confirm, a week before the start of the tournament, that “yes, the coach has come to see me, and told me I wouldn’t be in the starting XI at the World Cup”.The agreement gave Henry a chance to exit the international stage in as dignified a manner as possible. Domenech had decided to redeploy his team in a 4-3-3 formation that he’d hardly ever put to the test before. In theory, this bold system would have suited Henry perfectly, so much so that it was widely believed that the striker had lobbied the French management to implement this tactical change. Standing at the tip of an attacking trident, Henry would have been able to exploit his undiminished technical abilities with greater effect than on the left side of a 4-2-3-1 set-up, in which he expended too much of his declining energy to cover one of the game’s more enterprising full-backs, Evra.But when France finally adopted their new formation, in that 2-1 win over Costa Rica, it was Nicolas Anelka, not Thierry Henry, who found himself in the position of a No9. Some were surprised, and interpreted this as a snub but not Henry, who’d been forewarned by Domenech. He’d been told that his role would be that of what the French call un joker: a luxury substitute and that, should he refuse to play that role, he wouldn’t be part of France’s final squad.Domenech’s decision was prompted, as ever, by expediency, political nous and a measure of sporting logic to which I’m tempted to add: as was Henry’s. The destiny of both men had been closely entwined since 1998, when the up-and-coming coach had defended the player’s cause within the French camp as forcefully – and skilfully – as he could, something Thierry never forgot.It was fitting than the last act in Domenech’s chaotic reign should coincide with Henry’s swansong. It should also be said that the agreement made sense in pure football terms. Short of match fitness as Henry undoubtedly was (through no fault of his own), he remained a potent presence in front of goal, a vastly experienced international whose knowledge of France’s future opponents was unequalled in the French camp.That quality alone made dispensing with his services a risk that Domenech was not willing to take, notwithstanding the controversy that would have certainly erupted if Henry had been left behind. Henry accepted his de facto demotion with good grace, at least in public. “Je me mets minable pour l’équipe,” he said, which can roughly be translated as : “I sacrifice myself for the team” or even “I’m willing to grind myself into the dust for the team”.There was an element of calculation in Thierry’s stance but, as Jacques Crevoisier and Gilles Grimandi reminded me at the time, he was also a very rare beast: a footballer who could evaluate his own performances – and physical condition – with as much objectivity (and in deeper detail) than any of his coaches.He’d lost speed? He knew it. He couldn’t launch his runs with the same frequency as before? He knew it. Anelka could – just possibly - offer more playing with his back to goal? He knew that too, as he knew that a successful team is more often than not a blend of the older and the new. By his own admission, back in 1998, he and David Trezeguet hadn’t felt “pressure” when their turn had come to take centre stage during the penalty shoot-out against Italy. Twelve years later, Les Bleus needed fresher blood, players who ignored fear – but who would benefit from the guidance of those who had been the young, three World Cups ago. Henry could be that guide, and accepted it.True, a part-time role in France’s campaign might benefit him in more ways than one. It would distance him from the reviled Domenech. His humility would wrong-foot a number of critics. In the stands of the Felix Bollaert stadium, where France had taken on Costa Rica, he’d heard his name sung in the stands with genuine affection. The sight of Henry warming up on the touchline while his younger teammates were playing against Mexico and Uruguay in South Africa would lead many to wonder whether they’d misjudged him after all.The French team had retired to a five-star fortress on the shores of the Indian Ocean, the Peluza Hotel in Knysna, which was only accessible if you could get hold of a boat or show the proper identification documents to the policemen manning a roadblock on the one road leading to the luxurious compound. Henry kept as low a profile as possible, which, given the scant access the media were granted, meant he was invisible. Unverifiable – but persistent – rumours soon circulated of a “breakdown” between France’s new playmaker, the introverted Yoann Gourcuff, and disgruntled old hands, of which Thierry was said to be one, and Franck Ribéry another.Not that it mattered much: when Evra had been given the armband against Costa Rica, France Football ran the headline: “a true captain, at last” on its front page. The most successful French player in history (a tag that only seems to acquire value when you repeat it time and time again) had mutated from cosmopolitan record-breaker to some sort of pipe-and-slippers grandad within the course of a single year. This is not to say that he was resigned to his fate.Despite Domenech’s best efforts to keep the media at bay every day, L’Équipe and other publications painted a disquieting picture of what was happening behind the ramparts of France’s fortress. Henry could no longer consider himself the leader of Les Bleus, but could place himself in the slipstream of those who’d taken on that role, namely Ribéry, Evra, Eric Abidal, William Gallas and, up to a point, Anelka. So he did. As in 2002 and 2006, small self-appointed committees met in private to discuss the team’s performance and the options at their disposal.Domenech was lobbied to replace Gourcuff by the more defensive-minded Diaby on the right side of midfield. That proposal could be defended in tactical terms, but also hinted at racial faultlines within a squad in which players of West Indian and African origin outnumbered Caucasians by two to one. The “sacred union” of blacks, bleus et beurs which had so captured France’s imagination in 1998 belonged, alas, to history – or, for the more cynically-minded, was shown a posteriori to have been a fantasy.Other players favoured reinstating Thierry in the starting XI, and deploying Anelka on the right, in a position similar to that which he occupied at Chelsea. In truth, the subject of these conversations mattered less than what they revealed of the deleterious atmosphere within the camp, and of the dire consequences any slip-up in France’s opening game – against Uruguay – would have on the team’s chances.A number of people could press the self-destruct button. In the end, despite a desperately disappointing draw in which Henry featured for less than 20 minutes (when the Celeste had been reduced to 10 men), and could – maybe – have earned a thoroughly undeserved penalty when his volley crashed against a Uruguayan arm in the box (the source of much merriment in Ireland), the 0-0 scoreline – a repeat of the encounter between these two teams in the 2002 World Cup – came as something of a relief. At least we hadn’t lost.Back home, the mood was sombre defeatist, even. Sixty per cent of L’Équipe readers believed that Uruguay, Mexico and South Africa stood a better chance of qualifying than France. It hadn’t helped that the pre-tournament preparation in Tignes, a ski resort in the Alps, Tunisia and the island of the Réunion had been marked by a series of bizarre incidents: Lassana Diarra’s unexpected withdrawal from the squad, due to an obscure medical condition Gallas’s comical crash in a dune-buggy race Anelka falling from his mountain bike in another of Domenech’s stranger attempts at team-bonding. It didn’t get much better once the team reached its base in Knysna.Sports minister Rama Yade castigated the FFF for housing squad and delegation in one of South Africa’s most palatial (and most expensive) hotels on the eve of the opening match against Uruguay, the news filtered through that the same FFF had chartered a private plane for the players’ wives and girlfriends so that they could be in the Green Point Stadium on 11 June, at a cost of £220,000 and so on.The numerous sponsors of Les Bleus did all they could to drum up support in the French public, but in vain. As Arsène Wenger remarked, whilst it seemed that every other white van and black cab was adorned with the flag of St George in London, the tricolour was noticeable by its complete absence from Paris streets. It was yet another sign that France had fallen out of love with its team on that shameful night in St Denis every setback was and would be perceived as a deserved retribution for cheating Ireland out of a place in the World Cup.And to many it was fitting that the team which would avenge the Irish also wore green jerseys: Mexico, who, on a chilly night in Polokwane, beat France for the first time in their history and all but guaranteed that Les Bleus would leave the World Cup in humiliating fashion, as in 2002, and as they’d exited the European Championships of 2008, having shown nothing that resembled courage, skill or organisation.There is no need to give you a translation of L’Équipe’s headline of on 18 June: LES IMPOSTEURS. A photograph of Ribéry tangling with Mexican striker Guillermo Franco was accompanied by a scathing editorial, in which Fabrice Jouhaud exhorted his readers to laugh at Domenech’s pitiful crew. No sadness should be felt, he said, no tears should be shed. The ‘imposters’ didn’t deserve them. They didn’t care – why should we care about them? In England, a reporter of The Times found a new way to cook an old chestnut when he remarked that if there was no ‘I’ in ‘team’, there was certainly one in équipe. In France, it was thought there were 11, or even 13, as André-Pierre Gignac and Mathieu Valbuena were introduced to replace the hapless Anelka and Sidney Govou in the second half.With the honourable exception of Florent Malouda, goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, and possibly Evra, so overwhelmed by being given the captain’s armband that he could not hold back the tears when La Marseillaise soared above the vuvuzelas in the stadium, it was a case of every man for himself.Anelka’s shocking performance should have warranted a 123rd cap for Thierry as a substitute, but the call never came. France’s record goalscorer hardly bothered to warm up on the touchline and watched impassively as Gignac (four goals in 17 matches for France, eight in 31 for Toulouse in the 2009-10 Ligue 1 season) was brought on at half-time to replace the Chelsea striker, whom we’d soon learn had spoken to his manager in the crudest terms imaginable in the interval.From time to time, the cameras would cut to Henry, arms folded on his knees under a checked blanket, his face almost invisible under a woolly hat the bench might as well have been a bath chair wheeled to a deserted beach. The look on his face was not one of bewilderment, but of barely disguised boredom. He’d seen it all before, and so had we. Or so we thought, until 19 June, when L’Équipe, again, broke with over a century of tradition to print in huge block letters the following words on its front page: “Go get fucked up the arse, you dirty son of a whore”.The national team’s very public meltdown instantly became an affair of state in France, which should have alerted commentators that this was not only about football in fact, it had little to do with football, Anelka’s appalling language, Domenech’s laughable self-regard and incompetence, and so-called “senior players” using Les Bleus as a means to their personal ends, scheming, plotting, disgracing themselves whilst pretending they were rebelling against the ‘system’.It had to do with a fractured society, ridden with post-colonial guilt and neuroses, which had desperately wanted to believe in the 1998 black-blanc-beur utopia, and was now forced to smell its own shit. We, the French, had been cheated by a crew of young men from the banlieue who constantly spoke about ‘respect’ and gave it to no-one but themselves. Who valued nothing but diamond earrings, big wheels, easy girls, didn’t sing the Marseillaise, and could only think with two parts of their body: their feet, and their prick. A friend called me after South Africa’s victory in Bloemfontein, whom I told that – maybe – it’d be for the best. Laurent Blanc would step in. He’d find a team in ruins, yes. But he’d be given the time to build something new, to identify the right players, the next leaders, and …He interrupted me. “Don’t fool yourself,” he said, “the next generation is even worse: la racaille”. Racaille – the awful word that Nicolas Sarkozy had used to describe the youths of la banlieue, a hyperbolic version of ‘riff-raff’, the dregs of society which should be ‘washed away with a Kärcher’, as the then Home Affairs Secretary had said. And, to my disgust, I found a part of myself agreeing with him.Thierry Henry will never be forgiven for what he did and, especially, what he didn’t do when the foolishness of others gave him the chance to become a true hero. A few words from him would have swayed the indecisive the team he’d served magnificently for nearly 13 years was crying out for a figure of authority such as the former French captain, a Patrick Vieira, a Didier Deschamps, a Blanc, even a Zinedine Zidane, who could seize the rebels by the collar, and make them aware of the consequences that their shameful behaviour would have on their own careers – as it was clear that they’d lost any sense, if only temporarily, of the duties attached to representing their country.But Henry remained invisible and silent throughout. The FFF president Jean-Pierre Escalettes saw him sitting at the back of the “bus of shame”, as if he’d been a mere passenger there, and felt an urge to walk up to him – but checked himself, fearing (or so he said) that it would make captain Evra “look like a prick”. “I wasn’t good,” the septuagenarian confessed four months later, “I was powerless”.It wasn’t until the plane carrying the shamed team landed at Le Bourget airport that we finally heard Henry’s voice, when he, very much like Ribéry had done before him, arranged to be interviewed on French national television on 25 June, in this case by the former PSG chairman Michel Denisot, now one of the best-known presenters on the Canal Plus network. Once again, Thierry missed a beat, opening his defence by talking about the “inventions” of “people”, speaking about France’s debacle as it had been nothing more than the consequence of a series of poor results, blown out of all proportion by the media.Henry sounded even less convincing when he tried to deny there had been “clans” within the French camp. “Affinities”, yes, as always. When Denisot teased him – gently – about the relationship between Gourcuff and Ribéry, he immediately looked for the exit door: “I haven’t seen everything. When you go to your room to sleep …” Then, fixing Denisot with a far from friendly glare, he added: “I didn’t see any fight. I didn’t see anyone applying pressure on anyone else.” Gourcuff became “Yo”, with a familiarity I couldn’t help but feel was forced.And when the episode of the team bus was finally broached, Thierry said, again: “I didn’t see anyone applying pressure on anybody else.” Cut, back to the studio – and the PR exercise had turned into another disaster. I have yet to meet anyone who hadn’t been shocked by Henry’s desperately awkward performance. He sounded as if he’d weighed his options until he’d decided that he ought to do something.On the eve of this far from convincing exercise, Thierry had paid a grotesque visit to the Élysée palace to meet president Sarkozy, who’d been so “concerned” with the happenings in South Africa that he’d taken time off from a summit with Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin in Moscow to let it be known that the French head of state wasn’t amused. The footballer was whisked to the Champs-Élysées in a presidential car which picked him up on the tarmac of the Le Bourget airport, after he’d called De Gaulle’s successor from South Africa, or so we were told.Remarkable: a ball-kicker could get the keeper of France’s nuclear arsenal on the phone, just like that. Was it Henry (or his advisors) who thought it might be a good idea? Was it Sarkozy, the PR-obsessed politician, who felt he had to welcome France’s star footballer in his office to keep ‘in phase’ with his disenchanted electorate? Over 100 delegates from various NGOs who were supposed to meet the president at the time (11 am, 24 June) were shown the door in order to accommodate the former French captain, and were requested to make do with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs instead.Quite understandably, to quote Richard Thompson, they “took their business elsewhere”. What was said between Henry and Sarkozy never surfaced, despite the publicity given to their crisis talks. No cameras were allowed. No transcript of what must have been a fascinating conversation was passed on to the press. A parliamentary commission was put together for the sole purpose of holding an inquest on France’s disgraceful failure at the World Cup. On it went, ridiculously so. France had, truly, had a breakdown.Henry too had benefited from the protection and encouragement of a ‘big brother’ in the early stages of his career, literally so, as it was his own brother, Willy, who’d made sure everything was fine for the little one. He knew as well as anyone that, should he assume this role, he could have a profound impact on a group of players that was in desperate need of a figure of benign authority. He was the last of the world champions, for goodness sake.He was the last chance, perhaps, that France had of regaining the esprit de corps that had led them to three World and European finals in eight years. Henry could have exited international football in the fashion his achievements deserved, and, perhaps, silenced those who doubted that he could ever be considered a true “great” of the game. Players still listened to him. All he had to do was to walk out of a bus. But he stayed put, seemingly unconcerned. He remained true to the policy he’d adopted two months beforehand: do what’s asked of you, no more than that, shut up, and let them self-destruct if that’s what they want to do.You’ll have nothing to do with this mess anymore, you won’t be responsible for it.This is an edited extract from Thierry Henry: Lonely at the Top by Philippe Auclair. By David Hytner in Cape Town, 25 June 2010Raymond Domenech suffered the ultimate humiliation at the hands of his players as strikes, rows, resignations and recriminations left the French in disarray on one of the darkest days in the country’s football history.Domenech’s impotence was laid bare in extraordinary fashion after his players refused to train at their scheduled afternoon session, in protest at the French Football Federation’s decision to send home Nicolas Anelka. The Chelsea striker argued with Domenech in the dressing room at half-time in last Thursday’s defeat by Mexico, reportedly saying: “Go fuck yourself, you son of a whore.” After he refused to apologise to Domenech, the FFF expelled him from the squad.In front of hundreds of fans at what was an open session in Knysna, France’s players began by signing autographs. But once on the pitch, the captain, Patrice Evra, had a row with Robert Duverne, the fitness coach, which resulted in the latter storming off and the players withdrawing to the team bus and pulling shut the curtains. Domenech had to separate Evra and Duverne.Evra, who had earlier stayed on the bus to talk to Domenech, was seen with a letter, which turned out to be a statement from the players. Incredibly, it fell to Domenech to read it out. The coach seemed to be caught between a rock and a hard place and the scene was described by some commentators as the most unbelievable in the history of Les Bleus.The France team director, Jean-Louis Valentin, resigned. “It’s a scandal for the French, for the young people here, for the federation and the French team,” he said. “They don’t want to train. It’s unacceptable. As for me, it’s over. I’m leaving the federation. I’m sickened and disgusted.”France intend to train today, most likely behind closed doors, ahead of tomorrow’s game against South Africa, in which the players intend to “ensure that France regains its honour”. It is unclear whether Domenech will give the team talk. France need a handsome victory coupled with a favourable result in the Uruguay’s match against Mexico if they are to advance to the last 16.Of his argument with Evra, Duverne said: “Patrice Evra came to tell me that the players were not going to participate in training. I was angry because we play a big game in two days and we have no right to destroy our last chance.”Domenech had said that he had “left open the possibility” for Anelka to apologise but the player was not prepared to do so. “The decision to exclude him, then, was the right one,” Domenech said earlier in the day. “I am sorry for the children for whom the French team represents something. Anelka does not have the right to say such things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4903fdd438179188cd482ebf5b2720de9e11a029/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0aadbcc418d8ad83cfe290c740d307a","title":"premier league stasis compelling narrative 2017 18","story":"Somehow, with no title race since 2014 and Manchester City all but wrapping up this one in October, it has still been enthrallingAnd now the end is near. And so we face the final curtain or at best a rather demob-happy, oddly tension-free final flutter of a curtain that fell some time ago for most of English football’s top tier.Sunday’s final fixtures of the Premier League season will be played out in the usual conjoined fashion, simultaneous kick-offs designed to offer last-day drama and a level playing field to the final jostle for air and space.Except this year things are a little different. Those shared three o’clock kick-offs will serve only to illustrate the lack of tension at the fag-end of the season, the fixtures lined up like a taxi rank at midnight, lights on, engines idling, contentedly at rest.The last remaining notes of uncertainty in the Premier League are wrapped up in unlikely mathematics. It is possible Liverpool might lose to Brighton at Anfield while Chelsea win at Newcastle. On the other hand Brighton have nothing to play for and Liverpool have yet to lose at home in the league this season. In all likelihood the top four is already a lock.Below that the Europa League places are safely packed away. The only real drama of the past few weeks has lurked at the bottom. But as it stands Swansea, who cannot score, need to enact a 10-goal swing on Southampton to avoid sliding away along with the pre-doomed West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City.This sense of stasis is at least in keeping with the season as a whole, nine months that have provided a strange mixture of energy, colour and sweat, laced through with a peculiar air of predestination.Not that the Premier League’s promotional machine will be overly concerned as the season unspools into its final dreamy sunlit Sunday gadabout. This has been another fun, colourful season for a hugely successful product – lacking only in some vital note of tension.This is unsurprising. Never before has the gap between the richest and the poorest been so stark. Much hand-wringing has been devoted to this process over the last quarter century but this season feels like a significant point of departure, with the summit that separates the richest and most powerful disappearing up through the clouds and out of sight.In a sense this has its own kind of tension. It has become habit to lament the death of the FA Cup, with its folksy old notes of drama and upset, the social order briefly reversed. But the Premier League can provide this on its own now, a bespoke league pyramid all in one fixture list.Perhaps Huddersfield successfully avoiding relegation is a modern-day stab at a third-round Cup shock. Perhaps in time David Wagner’s round of arse-baring on-field bumps after the final whistle at Stamford Bridge will become our own parka-clad mods pouring out on to the Hereford mud, those moments when careers are made and legends forged, on this occasion simply by remaining in this most vertiginously stratified league.In many ways these are the twin themes of the season. More than ever power is set one way, as reflected in finances, possession stats, the one-sided nature of so many meetings within the same league. Ranged against this is football’s basic resilience, the ability of the game to resist whatever we do to it, to keep on churning out its notes of beauty and fascination, finding new forms even as its surrounding weather is drastically altered.The champions embody this most completely. The title race to all intents ended in October, the day José Mourinho’s Manchester United went to Anfield and winkled out a cautious 0-0 draw from a game in which they had a single shot on target. Mourinho defended his tactics energetically, pointing to the many twists to come, the attritional nature of the league season. He was wrong, though. The only way of hoping to catch Manchester City is to try to win like Manchester City, a team so stacked with goals and talent, so adept at depriving their opponents of meaningful contact with the ball that the majority of their Premier League encounters became near certainties.And still there is that paradox. Despite being a project geared towards removing uncertainty and variables – best tactics, coach, talent, money – City have been hugely compelling champions, not just unusually uplifting to watch but also lurking on the side of the light, such is the purity of Pep Guardiola’s commitment to his tactics, his ability to find new depths in already excellent footballers. Record points, record goals scored: this has been one of the most watchable one-sided winning runs one could hope to see.There is an end point to this. The Premier League has had nothing even vaguely resembling a title race since 2014, Demba Ba and all that. Even the miracle of Leicester City was something of a stroll without its underdog backstory.The gap at the top of the Premier League is even larger than it is in France, where the league really is an exercise in managing dead air. In La Liga the gap at the top is 15 points, in the Bundesliga 24. Europe’s domestic leagues have a problem, an absence of internal energy. It isn’t immediately clear what the answer might be. But too often the late stages of the Champions League, where power finally meets equal power, have provided the only note of interest in the spring.The Premier League has at least offered some fascination within the usual internal tiers, the leagues within the league. Manchester United and Tottenham have had fascinatingly indeterminate seasons, soundtracked by a basic existential confusion over what success is supposed to look like these days.United will finish second and may win the FA Cup. And yet the surrounding weather has been choppy, the sense of stalled progress there in the unease at Mourinho’s defensive tactics, a squad packed with trapped attacking verve that has only rarely played with freedom. Mourinho is already sharpening his cleaver before the summer. An improvement in results and, more vitally, style is required, if only to still the sense of ambient unease.Lifestyle football: this has been another regular note in the season, with Everton fans among those demanding not trophies or local derby victories but an improvement on the tone and texture of the football their team plays, demanding to be entertained at the very least. It is hard to argue with this in the league of stasis, a place where there is little else to aim for with any real sense of hope.Tottenham remain perhaps the most interesting club in the upper reaches, run at a profit, playing fine winning football but still gripped with that basic confusion over what adds up to success, though not so much internally. For Mauricio Pochettino a Champions League season in the new stadium has always been the priority, domestic cups be damned.Lower down the table it looked for a while as though this might be the year when the managerial old guard were finally junked, with shared howls of unhappiness as David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Alan Pardew and then Mark Hughes continued to maintain what appears to be a revolving Proper Football Man job share.The reality is perhaps a little different. Even slightly haggard middle-aged men tend to have their own distinct personalities and Moyes deserves credit for keeping West Ham in mid-table without any significant new manpower.Pardew tapped into another strange new anxiety, a weakness among some club owners to aim for a dimly conceived idea of entertainment and progressive, free-flowing football. Pardew was hired with a brief to unlock the talents of some ambitious signings, relax his players, primp the brand. In the event it was a disaster, an ill-matched confusion of a bold, peacocking public persona with sound mid-season footballing sense.Tactically there is, as ever, an urge to spot new trends, even if these can disappear just as quickly as they are detected. Certainly there has been an agreeably attacking trend. Jürgen Klopp’s blitz-football, those moments when Liverpool enter the red zone and attack in a dizzying swarm, have provided some of the moments of the season. The progress made by the player of the season, Mo Salah, has been stunning, with a rare joy in watching a supremely talented player reach out to the far fringes of his own attacking gifts.Further down the willingness to attack has also been rewarded, with Roy Hodgson providing one of most quietly heartening stories of the season at Crystal Palace. The freedom with which Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend performed, resurrecting a moribund team in autumn, has enlivened a league that for all its slight sense of claustrophobia, of being settled, remains impossibly watchable .Of all the many farewells and end notes one looms above everything else. Probably Arsène Wenger should have gone two years ago, possibly six or seven if the more disaffected fans are believed. Arsenal may now begin to cash in his legacy in earnest. Either way he leaves behind a club that will now become just another club like the other clubs, aspirational but also held in place by a hierarchy that looks as set as at any point in English football history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4a539871653f751f72c9bd3553f31bb156d08d7/625_72_2375_1425/master/2375.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe3e9af7ea097d83cf7b356ba815f4d1","title":"sensible gareth southgate england world cup","story":"Gareth Southgate has made the sensible decision to name his World Cup squad early, this coming week in fact, perhaps because of his close proximity to the furniture rearranging that took place when Glenn Hoddle trimmed Paul Gascoigne from his list at the last moment in 1998.As Southgate has explained, injuries permitting there is no need to prolong anyone’s agony when you have a couple of weeks to spare and a reasonable idea of the group you would like to select. Better to let everyone know the good or bad news early and give the iniduals in the finalised squad as much time as possible to get to know each other.Southgate has already been unlucky in losing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joe Gomez to injury. Both Liverpool players were virtual certainties to make the trip. Oxlade-Chamberlain on account of his tremendous form since moving from Arsenal, Gomez because of his versatility and ability to play in a back three. That may not be the way England actually line up, at least not all of the time, though the player who can happily provide cover in a couple of positions is always a bonus to a manager looking to leave himself as many options as a squad of 23 will\u0026nbsppermit.England at the moment are a young squad, with few seasoned internationals absolutely demanding selection, and for that reason Southgate may feel able to resist the temptation to include one or two names for the future simply to increase their experience.Jadon Sancho and Ademola Lookman, the two starlets breaking through in the Bundesliga, have both been mentioned, though the circumstances are not quite the same as when Sven-Göran Eriksson took a 17-year-old Theo Walcott to Germany in 2006. Back then the team virtually picked itself, everyone knew pretty much how it would line up and, having been preferred to strikers of the quality of Jermain Defoe and Darren Bent, Walcott failed to manage a minute on the pitch in the World Cup. He was put back with the under-21s by the next manager, Steve McClaren, and ended up missing out on the 2010 finals under Fabio Capello when he boasted vastly more experience.Sometimes the best of intentions do not always produce the desired results and Southgate may feel, with players such as Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Marcus Rashford under consideration, that he is doing enough for the future in any\u0026nbspcase.The flip side of the youth policy is what might be termed the elder statesman question. As already mentioned England do not have too many of those but Southgate is believed to be willing to name Joe Hart among his three goalkeepers, even though the most experienced international at his disposal is unlikely to be first choice.Martin Keown famously retired from international football after Brazil knocked England out of the 2002 World Cup in Japan, and who could blame him? In the later stages of his career he had been selected for the 1998 and 2002 tournaments by two different managers and failed to kick a ball in either.If Jack Butland and Jordan Pickford are the first two goalkeeping names on the list, surely it would do no harm to further Nick Pope’s encouraging development rather than take Hart along as unrequired back-up. Similarly, if Gary Cahill and Chris Smalling are unlikely to be first-team choices, it might be better to make up the numbers with an Alfie Mawson or a James Tarkowski, defenders presently on the periphery of the squad but players who are likely to be around when the next World Cup comes along.So, on that basis, here is a suggested squad. The three goalkeepers who deserve to go are Butland, Pickford and Pope, although Southgate may prefer Hart to the Burnley player. Three centre-backs who seem certain to make the trip are John Stones, Harry Maguire and Phil Jones, and another Burnley player, Tarkowski, would be an adventurous fourth. Southgate must also consider the claims of Mawson, Cahill and Smalling for one place as extra defensive cover, though Michael Keane has probably slipped off the radar after an unimpressive first season at Everton.England are pretty well off for full-backs even without Gomez, so much so that they can afford to ignore the fact that Danny Rose has fallen from favour at Tottenham. Rose may still get the call but few would argue if Kyle Walker, Kieran Trippier, Ryan Bertrand and Alexander-Arnold were the quartet boarding the plane.In midfield the big question is whether to take Jack Wilshere, now that Oxlade-Chamberlain has pulled out. While there are doubts over the Arsenal player’s fitness record, Southgate seems unconvinced by the claims of Jonjo Shelvey. There is also the debate over whether Raheem Sterling and Dele Alli should be regarded as midfielders or strikers, though little doubt that both will be going. So should Jesse Lingard, and one has the feeling that Southgate will allow as much time as possible for Adam Lallana to prove his fitness.The manager has hinted there will be no surprises, so that probably means Wilshere is in and Shelvey out, though it does not necessarily rule out a call-up for Loftus-Cheek. Five options for midfield might be Jordan Henderson, Eric Dier, Wilshere, Lallana and Lingard, and five for up front would be Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy, Sterling, Alli and Rashford. That leaves one spare place, which could go to Loftus-Cheek at the expense of an extra striker in Danny\u0026nbspWelbeck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb48374a776862355a8dc3b593a5cb1a3932931e/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57eec65caaa7767c261a9e57158e19bc","title":"blind date cameron steve","story":"What were you hoping for?A fun night out that didn’t involve me making up an excuse to leave early.First impressions?Tall with a friendly smile.What did you talk about?School crushes, driving in America and marathons.Any awkward moments?I initially offered a handshake, then insisted on a hug.Good table manners?Maybe too good: he tried to eat a taco with a knife and fork.Best thing about Steve?He had some amazing stories.Would you introduce him to your friends?I’d introduce him to most of them.Describe him in three wordsEngaging, interesting, cool.What do you think he made of you?Someone who isn’t afraid to discuss inappropriate topics of conversation at the dinner table.Did you go on somewhere?We sure did.And... did you kiss?No, but we got a second hug in.If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?I’d have found a way to make my job sound a bit sexier.Marks out of 10?8 (Steve told me he was going to give me an 8).Would you meet again?I didn’t make up an excuse to leave early, so yeah, I’d be keen to catch up again.What were you hoping for?An interesting story and a hangover the next day.First impressions?Very well turned out.What did you talk about?90s gay dramas, European social faux pas and running marathons.Any awkward moments?I made Cameron choose our dinner in its entirety.Good table manners?Perfect, especially because we were building and sharing the fajitas.Best thing about Cameron?Easy to talk to.Would you introduce him to your friends?Some of the more respectable ones, yes.Describe him in three wordsWell-travelled, driven, friendly.What do you think he made of you?That I talked too much, gave him my entire family history and offered little help in choosing our dinner.Did you go on somewhere?We did, to Hawksmoor for negronis.And... did you kiss?We didn’t, no.If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?Maybe that we had more chemistry?Marks out of 10?A solid 8.

CEO Oscar Munoz doubled-down, referring to the removal as “re-accommodating the customers”.This week the airline announced they were “streamlining” their onboard menu items on flights under four hours – their way of saying customers would be getting less food and fewer options. Muffins would replace hot breakfasts, wraps would replace full lunches, and tomato juice as a beverage option would be phased out.Customers were quick to express their outrage, and today United U-turned on the tomato decision. So why is the beverage – which is not particularly popular under normal circumstances in America – drunk so much on planes?There have been a number of scientific investigations trying to answer that question. In 2015, Robin Dando, a physiologist at Cornell, found that exposure to loud noises, like that of a jet engine, dulls sweet flavours but intensifies the umami taste present in tomato juice. Five years earlier, German airline Lufthansa commissioned research into the popularity of tomato juice when they realised they were serving 53,000 gallons a year. Researchers from the Fraunhofer Society found people enjoyed it more on planes because our taste and smell receptors are less sensitive at altitude, which means people enjoy the freshness of the juice without the earthy, mulchy taste.Those research-based accounts seem somewhat contradictory, though: can the taste of the drink be both enhanced and dulled? Even if they can, do ordinary passengers know that before they order the drink?It’s more likely there is a psychological basis for the popularity. Choosing a drink on a flight is an unusual situation: you have to decide when the trolly comes to you whether you’re thirsty or not. The beverage is normally free – meaning you want to extract as much value as possible. Tomato juice hits an odd sweet spot: it’s the only drink on the trolly that feels healthy, extravagant and unusual – plus you’ve seen so many other people order it, it becomes a tradition, the same way you eat popcorn at the cinema or hotdogs at a baseball game.There might be another reason too, which goes back to United “streamlining” the food options. With less free food available on flights, many people are hungry when the drink cart comes around but don’t want to pay for a meal. Tomato juice has a lots of fibre and high water content, and makes you feel full even when you’re not. It’s basically a cold soup you could even call it a free meal.So congratulations to United for realising their huge screw-up and reinstating it. Or, as a United spokesman put it, in the company’s inimitable style: “With all of our food offerings, we monitor customer feedback and what they would prefer and adjust accordingly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86c9b6e19db208848681af123d3a0753bb7bc003/0_1241_3723_2232/master/3723.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24f34890aa172159dc366099ac5eb3ab","title":"yotam ottolenghi tamarind recipes","story":"This sweet and sour fruit lends great flavour to prawn stew, asparagus salad and glazed pork chopsThe sharp and sweet acidity of the tamarind fruit is a much-loved tool of Indian and Pakistani cooks, as well as other parts of Asia and the Middle East. But it has never become a key player in western larders, which is a shame, because it shouldn’t be restricted to one cuisine. I often interchange tamarind with vinegar or citrus, and it’s already familiar to Brits through Worcestershire and HP sauces, where it provides the familiar, sharp kick.This southern Iranian dish features fresh fenugreek, which can be found in Middle Eastern shops and online. The leaves add a more herbaceous dimension than the seeds, although the latter would work here, too. It’s important to cook the herbs, because that creates the deep flavour. Serve with rice.500g raw king prawns, peeled and deveined4 tbsp olive oil1 tsp ground turmeric 5 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed Salt and black pepper100g tamarind pulp1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 2 green chillies, finely chopped5 spring onions, finely sliced80g coriander leaves, finely chopped, plus 5g finely shredded leaves, to serve 50g parsley leaves, finely chopped50g fenugreek leaves, finely chopped (or 2 tsp fenugreek seeds finely crushed in a spice grinder)1 tbsp plain flour1½ tsp ground coriander1½ tsp ground cumin1 tsp ground cinnamon⅛ tsp ground cloves¼ tsp chilli flakes1 tbsp soft brown sugarMix the prawns with a tablespoon of oil, the turmeric, one crushed garlic clove and half a teaspoon of salt, then leave to marinate.Soak the tamarind in 200ml hot water for 20 minutes, then use your hands to separate as much pulp as possible from the seeds and fibre. Strain into a sieve, pressing down on the pulp to extract as much liquid as you can: you should end up with about 160ml tamarind liquid.Heat two tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan on a medium heat, then sweat the onion for 10 minutes, until soft and lightly browned. Add the rest of the garlic and half the green chillies, and cook, stirring, for a minute. Add the spring onions, herbs and fenugreek, and cook on a medium-low heat for 20 minutes, stirring often, until deep green.Add the flour, spices, chilli flakes, a teaspoon and a half of salt and a generous grind of pepper, cook for 30 seconds, then add the tamarind liquid, sugar and 500ml water, and simmer for 10 minutes, until the sauce thickens and comes together.Meanwhile, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a frying pan on a high flame. Fry a third of the prawns for two minutes on each side, until golden brown, then move to a plate.Stir the remaining raw prawns into the sauce and cook for three minutes, until just cooked through.Serve the stew from the pan or a large bowl, sprinkled with coriander, the fried prawns and the remaining green chillies.This sharp, fresh mint sauce is a condiment for keeping in the fridge. I guarantee you’ll find yourself reaching out for it with increasing regularity: it’s great with lamb or pork, spooned over rice or mixed with vegetables.I prefer to extract tamarind paste from compressed pulp. Shop-bought pastes vary greatly in concentration of flavour and are generally sharper and more intense than paste you make yourself, so add it gradually, until you get a level of acidity you like.Prep 8 minCook 3 minMakes 1 small jar – about 180ml2 tsp shop-bought tamarind paste, or a lemon-sized piece of tamarind pulp 35g mint leaves15g parsley leaves, roughly chopped1 tbsp white-wine vinegar1 tbsp honey1 anchovy fillet, drained½ tsp ground cardamom½ tsp ground Iranian lime (optional)2 green chillies, deseeded and finely chopped1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 tsp dijon mustardZest of 1 lime, finely grated2 tbsp olive oilSaltIf using, soak the tamarind pulp in 60ml lukewarm water for a few minutes, work with your hands until the pulp falls away from the seeds, then pass through a fine sieve to make a thick paste. It will keep in the fridge for up to a month.Blitz two teaspoons of shop-bought tamarind paste – or two to three teaspoons of the homemade paste – with the remaining ingredients, two tablespoons of water and a quarter-teaspoon of salt: you should end up with a thick, green paste. Spoon into a clean jar and refrigerate for up to a week.This light, simple salad is perfect alongside a meat or veggie main. Counterintuitively, the sharp sauce complements the gentle flavour of the asparagus, rather than overpowering it. Gently mix the salad mere seconds before serving, to keep the thin asparagus slices as fresh as possible.Prep 5 minCook 10 minServes 4 as a side400g thick-stemmed asparagus, woody ends snapped off1½ tbsp olive oil1 tbsp lime juice15g mint leaves, roughly shredded30g pistachio, very lightly toasted and roughly choppedSalt2 tbsp mint, lime and tamarind sauce (see previous recipe)Using a peeler or mandoline, slice the asparagus lengthways into fine strips and mix in a bowl with a teaspoon and a half of oil, a teaspoon and a half of lime juice, half the mint leaves, half the pistachios and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.In a small bowl, stir the mint, lime and tamarind sauce with the remaining oil and lime juice and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.Just before serving, spoon the sauce over the asparagus, and sprinkle on the remaining mint and pistachios.Brining chops doesn’t only add flavour to the meat – it also makes them incredibly tender.

Drain the chops (discard the brine) and pat dry. Coat the chops in the five-spice mix and set aside for 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 220C425Fgas 7 and put a griddle pan on a high heat. Once the pan is hot, grill the chops for 90 seconds on each side, until they have good char lines, then transfer to a baking tray and roast for about five minutes, depending on thickness, until the meat is just cooked. Leave to rest for five minutes before serving.While the chops are cooking and resting, mix all the ingredients for the salad with an eighth of a teaspoon of salt. Serve each chop with the salad and a generous spoonful of the mint, lime and tamarind sauce."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cbf13ef7cdc57b61ee552df2651cbce39209a93/0_49_3519_2111/master/3519.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=436c65d830bc7224909cc12b54f17cd3","title":"rail fares reform tickets","story":"Absurdly high fares, a bewildering ticketing system, passengers playing cat-and-mouse with train companies trying to spot “split-ticket” bargains there are lots and lots of reasons why the root-and-branch reform of fares promised this week by the network operators is long overdue.Given the price-gouging history of the privatised train companies, and the way they are hooked on extorting walk-up passengers who dare not book at precisely 3.32am 12 weeks before travelling, none of us can be confident this is not just a PR con trick. But if they are serious about reviewing fares and introducing a bit more fairness, here’s six ways they can go about it.1. Per-mile fares Other countries have a quaint tradition where the cost of your train journey is based on the distance travelled. We abandoned this in favour of “charge whatever you can get away with”, or, its more recent iteration, “we’re having a laugh”.Take, for example, the prices I found for trains this coming Monday at about 10.30am booked a few days before. The single fare from Bristol (Temple Meads) to Bradford – that’s 166 miles – is £59, but you have to change twice. With one change, it’s £99.30. That’s 60p a mile.Compare that with a train from London (Marylebone) to Birmingham at the same time – 101 miles. The cheapest fare, with no changes, is £5.50, or 5p a mile. Explain that one.Walk-up fares are absurdly expensive, while off-peak special deals are arguably too cheap. Most European railways operate on a largely per-km system. But our operators will no doubt come up with a gazillion “dynamic pricing” reasons why fairness and simplicity is not possible here.2. Fair season tickets Cambridge to London Liverpool Street is 48 miles. The annual season ticket is a shocking £4,540. Tunbridge Wells to London Cannon Street is 30 miles. But the annual season ticket is more expensive, at £4,644. On an absolute level, and on a comparative level, both are bonkers. 3. Part-time season tickets You can buy weekly, monthly and annual season tickets. But if you are a flexible worker, travelling three times a week at peak times, there is nothing beyond some “carnets”. Matching ticketing with modern working patterns is urgently required.4. Annual all-country pass Germany’s rail network stretches 41,000km, compared with Britain’s 32,000km. Yet Deutsche Bahn offers the BahnCard 100 that lets you\u0026nbspboard any train anywhere in the country for a year for €4,270 (£3,733), or nearly £1,000 less than the 30-mile commuter journey from Tunbridge Wells. If Germany, where wages are higher, can offer this price – which even includes U-bahn (underground) trips – why can’t we?5. 16- to 18-year-olds Our fares system nonsensically assumes that at 16 you are an adult and able to pay the full fare. Meanwhile, at 60, Transport for London offers residents a “Freedom Pass”, with free travel after 9.30am, worth as much as £3,500 a year. 6. Buying tickets I fly London to Dublin frequently. I buy the flight in Ryanair’s app, usually £40-£60 return. I check in using a QR code on my phone, which, with a few scans, lets me through security and on to the plane. Rail ticketing technology is stuck in the 1970s. That said, I’m not sure I’d want Ryanair to run the railways."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d57d52fe9b75328229f7a89a7018281d5b7a21bc/3_7_2908_1746/master/2908.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3165f5ec1072a93ae2c2ef255276ed05","title":"salary what get paid talk about it makes brits cringe","story":"There’s nothing that makes Brits cringe more than discussing our salaries. Have the gender pay revelations changed that?How much do you earn? There are few questions that British people find so excruciating – or rude. Walking around Bristol on a heaven-scented spring day, buttonholing random strangers about their personal finances, I sense most would prefer it if I were asking when they last masturbated, or passed stool, or voted Conservative.“I’d say that’s a cheek!” says a gentleman in his 80s. But why? “I’m British, that’s why. My business is my business.”I try a younger guy in athletic gear, performing stretches by a park bench. “If you ain’t paying me, I ain’t interested,” he says. A model neoliberal citizen.I approach a couple of mothers in the park and cast a shadow over their picnic rug. One is a stay-at-home mum the other is not. “It’s not something you want to talk about in front of your friends, is it, what you earn?” the latter says. “Some people are underpaid, some people are overpaid, life isn’t fair.” Her friend pointedly attends to her child. I apologise for ruining their lunch.It’s awkward, isn’t it? The median annual income in the UK, according to the most recent Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, is £28,677 for full-time employees. Jeremy Corbyn’s last published tax return puts his income at £136,762 Theresa May’s was £117,350 but she hasn’t published one since she became prime minister David Cameron never published a tax return, but he did publish his earnings in light of the Panama Papers scandal: £200,307 from salary and rent in 201415. José Mourinho is on a reported £15m at Manchester United and is apparently unhappy. Chris Evans makes more than £2.2m at the BBC. A nurse starts at £22,128. It ought to be one of the least personal things about us – a simple data point, one that’s not so hard to estimate, surely – and yet clearly it’s emotive. “I don’t think that’s a very nice conversation to have publicly at all,” as Kate Winslet told the BBC when pressed on the issue of gender pay disparities in Hollywood a couple of years ago. “It seems quite a strange thing to be discussing out in the open like that. I am a very lucky woman and I’m quite happy with how things are ticking along.”How much do I earn now that I’m freelance? Not enough to turn down a commission from the , but a lot more than the national average: let’s leave it there for now. As I ask these “vulgar” questions of friends, family members and random strangers, I detect two main reasons for squeamishness. One, you might earn too little and be ashamed. Two, you might earn too much and be ashamed. Revealing your salary might bring a twitch on either string, depending on who you’re talking to.A fellow freelance writer on £26,000 confesses: “I do find it shameful to talk about because I feel like it’s not very much for someone who has had a lot of advantages in life.” At the other end of the income scale, there’s often a fear of being judged for having made certain compromises. “I wouldn’t share my salary because I’m quite embarrassed that I’m earning too much and still don’t feel it’s enough to live a comfortable London life,” says a friend who works in recruitment in the City. Another who classes herself as a “high earner” say she doesn’t want to be labelled a “corporate whore”.“I like to be on equal terms with people irrespective of our salaries,” she says. “While I regularly get the extra round or pay for dinner for friends who might not have as much cash, I don’t like there to be an expectation that I will do those things.” There are further reasons, too. “It makes me feel self-conscious and embarrassed about my relatively modest living arrangements and asset accumulation given my high salary. And I don’t like knowing when people earn more than me. It leads me to question whether I’m sufficiently successful and leaves me feeling dissatisfied with my lot.”The people most willing to share their figures, I find, are those who take a certain pride at having succeeded on their own terms. In 2012, Jack Monroe was on income support and in debt, with a food and fuel budget of less than £10 a week and a son to feed now she is a successful food writer with a couple of bestselling cookbooks to her name and a company employing four members of staff. “Mine is the last salary to be paid at the end of each month,” she says. “I pay my staff well. I don’t want the people I work with to find themselves in difficult circumstances.” She pays herself £21,000 a year which, given she works about 50 hours a week, she estimates as about half what she pays her cleaner (£14 an hour). “I probably don’t get paid as much as I should, but that’s a hit I’m prepared to take as I’m used to living on not much money. It’s a real skill being financially resilient and keeping your head.”My old university friend Simon, who has cerebral palsy, tells me he earns “closer to £40,000 than £50,000” as a policy research manager. “Very few people ever ask me this question as most of the occupants of our village who go down the pub seem to be either scientists for biopharma or financial masters of the universe which makes my salary seem puny,” he says. “Nonetheless, in terms of providing the nice things my family need, I feel well paid, and in terms of what my father gets paid – all I have ever really aspired to – I am doing OK as well. For me, it is also about being a disabled person – my quality of life is far better than many other people in my position typically expect and I feel profoundly lucky.”Still, a headline figure can be misleading. You might earn £10,000 working for a charity because you’re a saint you might also be married to a management consultant who makes six figures by laying other people off. You might turn down that slightly compromising commission because you have impeccable ethical credentials you might also have a trust fund. Also: which number do you choose? It’s customary to cite pre-tax income on job adverts in the UK, but it’s not in France and many other European countries – which immediately changes your relationship to that figure. If you’re self-employed, do you cite gross income (ie all the money you earned in a year), net profit (ie all that minus expenses) or post-tax income (ie all that minus the amount you pay in tax)? How do assets come into it?And what about benefits, tiny amounts, really, but which often incite just as much envy and resentment as, say, the £3.4m home secretary Sajid Javid is reckoned to have earned when he was at Deutsche Bank? It gets complicated. The first person I encounter in Bristol is Kirsten, 49, walking with a crutch with Snoop, her staffie cross. “We saved each other,” she says. Following failed surgery on a degenerative spinal condition, she lives on disability benefit and volunteers at a local hospital for the chronic pain management programme. “I don’t really know how much I get… I mean, I sort of know. But I’d rather not say.”She’s used to difficult conversations about pay. Before her operation, she spent most of her career administering mental health services for the local authority (“But that was cut due to funding reasons”) and went on to work in human resources for a small firm that recruited healthcare professionals. “It was so hard to make everything fair,” she says. “I’d be fighting for iniduals who’d been on minimum wage for a long time. There was a bit of hypocrisy going on in management, them all getting bonuses and the people at the bottom being on minimum wage.” Her current benefits are OK: “But it’s been a hard slog to fight for them.”People on lower wages – and especially on minimum wage – are generally fine with telling me. I catch Theresa, 54, a contract cleaner, just as she finishes her shift at a supermarket. “I was fortunate when I had my family because my husband had his own business, so I was ‘kept’ for a while. But then my husband got ill and was unable to continue with that. The benefits weren’t enough. He was lucky to find this cleaning job, but he found it a struggle with his medical condition – he lives on painkillers – so we were able to job-share. When he’s struggling I step up the pace and the company’s happy. And because we do a good job, we get sent here, there and everywhere as overtime.” The ability to share hours and fuel costs with her husband is a bonus. “But what goes in comes out.” After rent, council tax, bills and so on, she’s left with “pennies”.But she says she’s lucky. She likes the variety of locations, and the hours (approximately 5am-1pm) mean she can look after her grandchildren after school, so that her children can go to work. “My daughter-in-law starts work at five, finishes at one, comes home, hands my son the keys, and off he goes until 11 at night. If they do it that way, they don’t have to pay for childminders. And still at the end of the day, they haven’t got anything for what I call the little luxuries – you know? And that makes me quite cross.”Mickey, 58, is philosophical about the £23,000 he is paid as a park keeper by the council. “It’s not bad – but I could be earning more,” he reflects. “I used to have my own company and run my own contract here, but then the council took over and employed me.” He hasn’t had a pay rise for six years, so in effect his pay has gone down. But as a public sector employee, he can at least look up what his bosses are earning. According to the Bristol city council website, its highest paid positions are strategic directors (on £136,000) the salary ratio of highest-paid to lowest-paid employees is about 10:1. (Private companies will soon be obliged to publish this data, too.) However, the highest-paid roles are being replaced by new, even higher-paid roles: executive director (£135,000-£165,000), level two director (£94,000-£120,000) and level one director (£85,000-£105,000).But Mickey is philosophical. “They do a job,” he says. “They get paid the going rate. There are no tensions.” Indeed, he reckons his job is more enjoyable than theirs. “I grew up round here. My dad worked here. This is special, the best place in Bristol. I’d do this for no money.” Let’s hope no strategic directors read this.I notice Ed, 44, sitting at a table by the park cafe, tapping at his laptop in aviator shades. “I can tell you what I earn, but it’s weird – I’m not a normal 9-5 type person,” he says. “It’s nothing at the moment.” He recently returned from Austin, Texas, where he launched a craft cider business that paid him an annual salary of about $85,000 (£62,500) he sold most of his shares for about $2m (£1.47m) and is currently working out what to do next. In the meantime, that “nothing” includes an annual idend of about £25,000 a year from a cider bar he owns in Bristol.“I’m in an exceedingly lucky position,” he says. “I come from a pretty poor background. None of my old friends is a particularly high flyer – I’m kind of the friend that my mates take the piss out of for being rich. People tease me about what I’m going to do with the money.”He has always been of a “tax the rich” mindset, but now he has to adhere to that himself. “One of the things I hate is that when you go to see any accountant, the assumption is you want to pay the minimum amount of tax. That agenda is unhealthy.” To his surprise, his US accountant recently told him he was exempt from paying $370,000 tax he thought was due on the capital gains in his business, owing to a piece of post-financial crash-era legislation. So now he’s figuring out what to do with it. “I’d like to do something with a bit more social worth than just getting people drunk,” he says. “Maybe something political.”I speak to a couple of retirees whose dogs are entangled: David, 88, and Sue, 73. “We’ve just met,” David says. “She’s from Yorkshire, I’m a Bristol native.”“I’ve lived in Bristol 27 years, thank you very much.”David spent most of his career as a schoolteacher and a local government officer before that when I ask how much he earns, he says “nothing”, besides his state pension and his teacher’s pension. How much is that? “Aha!” he says. “I’m not telling you because you can find out.”“The same with me,” Sue adds. “It would be easy for you to find out. My state pension is the very basic state pension and it’s topped up by the very basic pension credit.” (She eventually discloses that it’s £120 a week, plus £101 top-up.)David considers reticence to be a British trait. Sue isn’t convinced. It depends where in Britain you’re from and when you were born. “I come from a mining village near Wakefield where everybody knew everybody’s business, so attitudes were completely different,” she says. “People were careful with money because there wasn’t a lot of it to go round. That’s the difference between then and now. There is too much of an attitude now of, ‘I want it, I’ll go out and get it.’ Then, if you couldn’t afford it, you didn’t have it.”“How much do you earn then?” David asks me.I still find these numbers a little limiting. How do you factor in security, for example? I have no pension, no sick pay or holiday, no idea what I will be doing next month, and recently lost my one regular source of income, so my bank balance fluctuates wildly. Or joint income? My wife, also a freelance writer, earns much less, so it’s ended up being me who pays all the bills, childcare, rent and so on. Or hours worked? Usually 60 a week? Journalism is not a growth industry. With a rough average of 40p a word, I must publish about 175,000 words a year, about two novels’ worth, to sustain it… And yet, I’m white and male, I’m not scraping sewers or toileting the elderly, and I feel the need to provide hundreds of extra words to justify my privilege (also: I’m paid by the word). I suppose my main worry is not what I earn now so much as what I’ll earn in the future. Is the industry sustainable? What will I do when I’m old? How does anyone else manage? The wider narrative since 2008 has been one of decline: work more, expect less, hope you get lucky. Short of envious of my fellow citizens, I’m simply impressed that anyone can make it work.I approach a man who’s quietly drinking a beer while looking after his baby daughter. He’s a stay-at-home dad for three days of the week and earns £15,000 from a couple of days lecturing at Bristol University. His wife works at Airbus and is the main breadwinner. “We had lots of clear conversations about how best to make it all work, economically and emotionally – and I’m certainly not resentful because we’re in a happy position where one of us can spend time with the children,” he says. “I think the conversation has matured. People recognise that to earn a stupid amount of money, you have to make sacrifices elsewhere.”Does he think Swedish-style salary transparency would help matters here? He sighs. “It would require such a change of mindset. Post-Brexit, I’ve lost a bit of faith in humanity, to be honest. As things roll on, that concept that we’re going through progress… you kind of think, huh. Maybe we can regress sometimes, too?”Three Hare Krishnas on a hill are playing a harmonium and chanting mantras in harmony. When I tell them I am going around asking people how much they earn, they all laugh.“That’s such a boring question!” says Jahnava, 45. “I thought it was going to be something juicy.” She works for a charity called Coracle, which provides her a salary of about £5,000. Woah, that’s not much, I say. “I rely on the Lord.” You would say that. What about food, shelter? “It’s provided by the charity.”Her friend Ellis, 22, has long blond hair and a shirt with lobsters and bananas on it. “I don’t know how much I earn – I don’t have a job right now,” he says. “I’m looking to get a portering job in the hospital, which would be about 18 grand, I think.” How does he support himself in the meantime? “I don’t know.” He laughs. “Jobseeker’s allowance. And lovely people around me. My grandparents give me a little bit of cash sometimes.”I mention that most people find these conversations difficult.“Maybe British people are too much in their minds?” Jahnava says. “At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter how much money you have to live. If you have food, shelter and your health, there’s nothing to stop you from being completely content.

From channelling your inner Kate Moss and Love Island contestant to ditching the Woodstock look, here’s how to survive itYes, that’s even if you can remember them. Use the 90s revival as an excuse to be comfortable and look cool. You will need a pair of dungarees (think TLC), some tiny sunglasses (The Matrix) and a bumbag (Vanilla Ice … or not). Bonus: wannabe Spice Girls (yes, that is intentional) can even dig out, we mean buy, ginormous-soled Buffalo trainers. After all, what better way to walk through miles of mud?Nineteen sixty-nine is a long time ago. Enough time, you might think, for the Woodstock look to be to solely the territory of BBC4 documentaries and those who actually, you know, live in Woodstock. To be clear, a festival in 2018 is not an excuse to pretend you saw Hendrix do the Star-Spangled Banner, or wear flowers in your hair. Fringing and headbands are not OK. And anyone who commences body painting – unless they’re Keith Haring and Grace Jones at the Paradise Garage, obvs – is seriously in breach of the fashion commandments.The unwritten rule that you don’t wear the band’s T-shirt to the gig has been broken by fashion – soz, musos. Now, merch is the statement you want to make in your field of choice. It can take the form of caps – Kendrick Lamar’s What Happens on Earth Stays on Earth – or T-shirts. Bieber’s are a merch classic, and we can only imagine what Beyoncé and Jay-Z will bring come their tour in June.So, there’s you. You booked your ticket ages ago and had the date marked in your diary for months. Then there’s RihannaLady GagaGwen StefaniPJ Harveydelete as appropriate. They arrive at the site by osmosis, or possibly a helicopter, and remain backstage until they perform, unscathed by the surroundings, in anything from a dress made of mirrors to a perspex headpiece with Hellraiser vibes. Last year, Rihanna wore a Gucci chainmail bodysuit to Coachella, just to hang out in her trailer. Imagine trying to use a Shewee in one of those.Sure, in other ways, Moss’s lifestyle is not exactly easy to attain: the Count boyfriend, the holiday schedule, the house in the Cotswolds. But her festival look is by numbers – in a good way. Moss knows that when you’re out in the wilds, you should stick to the classics: jean cut-offs, sunglasses, wellies and a biker jacket. It may not be the height of innovation but is the best thing when you’re battling an easterly gale and trying to keep the lager in your cardboard cup unharmed. Goals.Alexa Chung is the patron saint of modern festival dressing. She has done it all: PVC trousers, slip dresses and over-the-knee socks, often with a Barbour, usually with a bit of side eye. These are clothes that suit someone walking through the backstage area pretending they don’t notice photographers. They are not the kind of thing to wear when “having a wash” translates to using a couple of wet wipes in your wonky tent.Wings seem to have faded from fashion, but the vestiges of the child’s dressing-up-box remain. Paris Hilton has a lot to answer for: her Coachella look last year involved a rainbow frock and cat ears. And it goes without saying, no Native American headdresses, bindis or anything that can be perceived as cultural appropriation. Not in a festival, not IRL, not anywhere. Not OK.

It’s not easy. You may have to watch it twice, maybe three times, probably more. In the clip, Childish Gambino is a dancing, running, alternately homicidal and joyous streak of shirtless charisma. Your eyes want to follow him, soak him in. But if you do, you’ll miss the point he seems to be making in the video, an enigmatic and provocative effort that has accumulated over 74m YouTube views and hundreds of thinkpieces in the six days since its release.So instead, try directing your attention on all that’s happening in the background as Childish Gambino – the musical moniker of multi-hyphenate artist Donald Glover – moves through a spare industrial space in a succession of meditative tracking shots that serve as steady foundation for the frenetic action they capture.There are children in school uniforms doing dances of African and American origin. There is a white horse with a hooded rider. There are police. There are people running across the upper level of the space that looks increasingly like a prison as the video progresses. There are chickens, girls on bicycles, money in the air, mobs running in riot-like pandemonium. There are kids lost in their cellphones, car fires, SZA sitting on the hood of what appears to be a 1986 Camry.While Childish Gambino is surely the star – playing the role some have suggested is America itself – viewed in context of the background action, the video is dizzying, hypnotic treatise on racism, gun violence, joy, spirituality, hip-hop and entertainment in the United States. Its symbolism has been linked to Jim Crow, Michael Jackson and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. YouTube videos investigating these Easter eggs have more views than many actual music videos.Since debuting This Is America during last week’s episode of Saturday Night Live – for which he served as host and musical guest – Glover has refused to reveal the video’s message, telling TMZ “that’s not for me to say.” What’s certain is that This Is America is a brilliant, career-defining moment. “This is one of the great performers in modern America,” says TV host Touré, whose books include 2012’s Who’s Afraid of Post-Blackness? “He’s showing a really interesting ability to do soul music, television, movies, comedy and drama and to make art that has political substance, but not so much that it becomes propagandist or preachy.”This Is America has dared us to decide what to make of it. The video’s background action commences immediately after the video hits it pivot point: Childish Gambino pulling a gun from his pants and shooting a hooded man in the back of the head, execution style. This is when he declares the song’s guiding principle: “This is America.”The implication is that the brutal violence and general mayhem is no different than daily life in the US, where guns, entrenched racism and police brutality against black Americans dominate the headlines. Gambino goes on to kill a gospel choir in a moment evoking the 2015 Charleston massacre, in which nine people died during a prayer service at one the country’s oldest black churches. The guns are handled with great care, being wrapped in red cloth some believe symbolizes red-state second-amendment reverence. Meanwhile, limp bodies are casually pulled out of the frame.Others view This is America as a clear critique of the way such violence is digested by a culture in which mass shootings and the killing of unarmed black men are so common that we have become numb to them, distracted by entertainment in the same way the video’s joyous dance sequences distract us from chaos in the background.The video was directed by Hiro Murai, who also directs Atlanta, the half-hour series Glover, 34, writes, produces and stars in. (His brother Stephen serves as co-writer and head story editor.) The show follows rapper Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry), his cousinmanager Earn (Glover) their friend Darius (Lakeith Stanfield) and Earn’s girlfriend Van (Zazie Beetz) as they maneuver through the Atlanta rap scene. In its two seasons Atlanta has been widely celebrated, and awarded, for its honest, melancholic, darkly funny and often surreal take on black America.“Atlanta is the best show on TV, period,” Chris Rock said in a March New Yorker profile of Glover. Jordan Peele noted: “For black people, Atlanta provides the catharsis of ‘Finally, some elevated black shit.’”In fact, Peele used Childish Gambino’s biggest hit Redbone during the opening credits of Get Out, his Oscar winning 2017 horror film about the daily terrors of being black in America. The biggest hit from Childish Gambino’s 2016 LP Awaken, My Love! Redbone is a slinky gospel slow ride showcasing Gambino’s soulful (and surprisingly high-pitched) vocals. “Stay woke,” the song’s chorus implores, a message that for Get Out’s protagonist Chris was a foreboding warning of the threats to come. “Stay woke, that’s what this movie is about,” Peele said of the song during a 2017 interview with HipHopDX. “I wanted to make sure this movie satisfied the black core movie audience need for characters to be smart and do things that intelligent, observant people would do.”Redbone won the 2018 Grammy for best traditional R\u0026ampB performance, an award Glover presumably put on his shelf alongside the two Emmys and pair of Golden Globes he’s picked up for Atlanta. The album from which Redbone came itself earned three Grammy nominations and demonstrated a marked evolution from Childish Gambino’s first two albums, which were defined by a jokey internet humor, more straightforward beats and rhyming and lyrics the Pitchfork review of 2013’s Because The Internet equated to a Christmas ham.Awaken, My Love! found Childish Gambino dropping the structure of his previous output in favor of lushly layered psychedelic fun in the tradition of George Clinton and vocals reminiscent of Prince at his most soulful. Lyrics evoked the same surreal sense of dread that permeates some of Atlanta’s best scenes – “All I see is zombies  Feeding all around us  All they eat are people  and you won’t survive,” Gambino sings on Zombies – and forecasted the complicated racial politics of This Is America. Childish Gambino debuted the album with three shows in California’s new age desert nexus of Joshua Tree, performing in glow-in-the-dark body paint. Cameras were expressly forbidden. “He always had technique and talent and was always clearly a good rapper,” says Touré. “But it was this funny kind of jokey hip-hop. To see him develop into a very soulful, Parliament-style sort of R\u0026ampB artist, it’s extraordinary.” “It sounds like I’m sucking my own dick – ‘Oh, he thinks he’s great at everything,” Glover said in the New Yorker, describing his lifelong ability to identify the algorithms that would make him successful at anything he attempted, “But what if you had that power?” What Glover was saying is that he knows he does, and there is little reason to doubt him. He can rap while perfectly executing the South African Gwara Gwara, start a massive cultural conversation and earn unbridled praise in the process. (“Donald Glover is a Genius,” Erykah Badu tweeted after the video’s release, while Janelle Monáe’s tweet of just Glover’s name received over 5,000 retweets.) He makes one of the decade’s landmark television shows and has won many prestigious awards. At the end of the month, he joins one of the most successful movie franchises of all time as Lando Calrissian in Solo: A Star War Story. Next year, he’ll play Simba in the live-action reboot of The Lion King. He left his gig as a staff writer for 30 Rock after three years because he wanted to focus on acting, and left his role in the beloved series Community because he wanted to focus on music. He’s suggested that the next Childish Gambino album will be his last, as he’s bored with the project. Given the scope of his career thus far, Glover’s statement indeed seems less self-fellating and more a sober assessment of the extraordinary gifts he’s fully aware he possesses. Gifts that, much like in the extraordinary joy and terrible violence of the video, are hard to look away from.

A 10-day-long extravaganza – with free entry for its midweek community events – All Points East brings to the UK the combination of eclecticism and mega names that Barcelona’s brilliant Primavera Sound nails year upon year.

If you love J Dilla more than your firstborn, this is the festival for you. As previously mentioned, for the first time since its inception in 2007, Field Day won’t be taking place in its spiritual home of HackneyTower Hamlets.

Fifteen years later, and Download is stuck with its oh-so-2003 name, but it’s also one of the most joyous festivals in the UK, home to one of music’s last staunch tribes: the mighty metaller.

Probably.Does it pass the festival Bechdel test? There’s a lot of long, luscious hair being headbanged across Donington Park this June, but hardly any of it belongs to women. Metal isn’t generally known for its strong female presence and though the likes of Rolo Tomassi, Marmozets and the Pink Slips are fronted by women, the only all-female acts we can spot on the entire bill are Babymetal and L7.

Now grime rules the roost, with Stormzy’s only UK festival set happening here this summer. Wireless also boasts one of the youngest crowds on the festival circuit, and as such the energy levels will likely put to shame anyone over the age of 25.Does it pass the festival Bechdel test?

Pop genius Dua Lipa is the only female solo act to grace the main stage and even though the likes of Sigrid, Nadia Rose, Kate Nash, Hinds and Dream Wife are featured lower down the bill – and the quarter-female Wolf Alice headline the BBC Radio 1 stage – there is still a blind spot when it comes to women being invited to play bigger slots.See also TRMSMT, Isle of Wight, RIZE festivalWho Vampire Weekend, St Vincent, Feist, Josh T Pearson, Oh Sees, Ezra Furman, Omar Souleyman, Julia Holter, Mulatu Astatke, Lucy DacusWhat Small but perfectly formed, End of the Road has its roots in alt-country, but also welcomes indie big-hitters and experimental folkies.

Namely, that after 11 consecutive Reading and Leeds festivals (plus a dozen or so Glastonburys, a handful of T in the Parks, a sprinkling of Indietracks and the occasional depressing event set up in a massive Portuguese car park and most probably headlined by Muse), your memories are likely to be somewhat squiffy. They’re the kind of memories that have been doused in several litres of Lightning Strike cider, left to marinate in a hedge for four days and woken up with ill-advised tribal facepaint. And, like the bearded man in the healing fields who claims he can levitate through the 17th dimension, they’re probably not to be trusted. So when I check my own festival memories I have to wonder if many of them actually happened. Did I really see a baby in a buggy crowdsurfing through a packed field? Can it be true that I carried one of my friends across a mud-plagued Glastonbury site while he told passing strangers that he was the supreme ruler of the universe, only to then watch him pass out in a toilet block and urinate on himself? Was the night I spent inhaling toxic plastic fumes as tents and toilet blocks were set ablaze around me a figment of my imagination, a fever dream brought on after eating an undercooked chicken pad thai?Whether it’s watching Kevin Rowland confuse an entire crowd by wearing white stockings and suspenders or witnessing Michael Eavis redefine the very definition of the term “singing” while onstage with Stevie Wonder, the thing about festival memories is that they often take on a strange, hallucinatory air. Sure, you buy your ticket to watch Oasis or Beyoncé or Skepta – but then you come back telling friends that actually you went to see six shows by a fully grown man pretending to be a lobster while singing Christmas songs instead.That is the whole glorious point. The best festivals should exist at the point where reality and surreality meet, and your mind is no longer completely sure what’s happening. There should be giant spiders spouting fire, DJ sets that involve you climbing onstage to dance in your wellies, and deep and meaningful conversations about life, the universe and where you put your last piece of chewing gum.You’re left with a muddy mountain of experiences, many of which are hard to verify and almost all of which have no application once back in the real world. It’s unlikely that many potential employers out there are going to be impressed by your ability to fashion semi-waterproof shoes out of two Sainsbury’s bags and a lanyard. Remembering where your tent is located at 5am after several hours in the rave fields might be a game-changer at the time but it doesn’t really translate to anything particularly useful in the office environment. But that’s not important. What’s important at a festival is that you had the best possible time – and that’s especially likely to be the case if you can barely remember any of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0a3b6f7beaf5bbf9e40a4ae50c6a05d014edc11/0_0_4582_3055/master/4582.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc18312cd415b1d10dab490e649cb007 480w","title":"brexit customs standoff could go on for another week sources","story":"Ministers pessimistic about prospect of finding solution, with two rival plans in playResolving the cabinet standoff over customs after Brexit could take another week or more, senior government sources say, as ministers prepare to meet in breakout groups to thrash out the rival proposals.Theresa May has ided members of her deadlocked Brexit inner cabinet into two groups, tasked with tweaking the two rival plans to find an acceptable compromise.But ministers remain pessimistic about the prospect of finding a workable solution, with one comparing the process of wearing down their opponents with the Marathon des Sables, an endurance race across the Sahara.“It feels like everyone’s quite entrenched,” said another senior source.The impasse has stalled negotiations in Brussels, and is becoming increasingly politically embarrassing for May, who was challenged by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, about the “shambles” of her negotiating strategy in parliament on Wednesday.A spokesman for the prime minister said on Friday: “We think both options have merit, we’re discussing both of them further. The groups reflect the issues that have been raised in relation to the two models. The groups are working through these issues of priority and need to come up with the right solution.”He added: “We are not setting any further deadlines for ourselves apart from October. That continues to be our focus.” October is the deadline by which the government hopes to agree the outlines of a trade deal, to allow time for parliament to ratify it.But the EU27 have stressed that they want to see progress on the Irish border issue in particular before the European Council meets next month.The depth of the isions in cabinet burst into the open last week, with the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, describing May’s favoured customs partnership as “crazy”.The Conservative rebel Dominic Grieve, who has repeatedly challenged the government over its Brexit plans, said Johnson should resign if he disagreed so profoundly with other members of the cabinet.“The prime minister has a difficult task and I don’t think it’s helped by this tendency of the foreign secretary to express himself,” he told the . “If you don’t like a policy, you leave the government. That’s what you should do. If there are problems, you either accept them or you have to go. That’s your choice.” Asked if that meant he thought Johnson should resign, he said: “He should resign. Yes.”But allies of Johnson stress that both proposals remain in play, and point out that the business secretary, Greg Clark, has spoken out in favour of the partnership plan.The cabinet breakout groups have already met once and will gather again on Monday.Brexiters remain deeply sceptical about the customs partnership, which also has the backing of Philip Hammond, and would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU.This “hybrid model”, as it is also known, will be discussed by the group including David Lidington, Liam Fox and Michael Gove. Brexiters fear it will force Britain to remain too close to the EU copying the bloc’s product standards and regulations, for example.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.One Brexiter suggested the prime minister may be hoping the persuasive Lidington can “flip” Gove or Fox.The other group will discuss the so-called “max fac” proposal favoured by the Brexit secretary, David Davis. It relies on technology to minimise border checks, but its opponents believe it cannot resolve the Irish border issue.Davis will have to try to convince Clark and the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, that it can be tweaked in such a way that it can work. But backers of the customs partnership believe max fac would never get through the Commons.Negotiators in Brussels are ready to resume talks with the UK as soon as the government has a preferred solution and have laid out a series of questions about the customs partnership, having initially dismissed the idea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c09df26be112836df19d517d49fd05ed255f02e/0_0_3056_1834/master/3056.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e104ea4e0729ef9159acba913d22206","title":"jeremy corbyn must change course on eea says lord kinnock","story":"Former Labour leader says Corbyn’s objections to European Economic Area membership are based on ‘infantile leftist illusion’Jeremy Corbyn will commit a “serious evasion of duty” if he does not change course and back the UK retaining key aspects of the single market after Brexit, the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has said.In a strongly worded attack, the peer signalled that Labour MPs should defy Corbyn if he repeats instructions to abstain in parliamentary votes on Britain staying in the European Economic Area (EEA).A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group.

An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.Lord Kinnock was one of 83 Labour peers who rebelled against Corbyn and backed an amendment to Brexit legislation in the upper house for the UK to remain in the EEA – a grouping that allows for the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital within the European single market.In a thinly veiled swipe at Corbyn, Kinnock said objections to EEA membership were based on “infantile leftist illusion”.He said that if Corbyn did not alter his stance he would condemn the working people Labour was supposed to support to the “rockslide” of hard Brexit.With the pro-EEA amendment to the EU withdrawal bill set to return to the Commons, Kinnock wrote in The Independent: “It would be a serious evasion of duty if Labour did not seize this chance to protect our country from the rockslide of ‘hard’ Brexit.“By supporting continued EEA participation we can end the prime minister’s deference to the cliff-edge kamikaze squad and force her, or her successor, into the pragmatic patriotism of putting country before party.”Kinnock defended his refusal to abstain in the EEA vote, as Corbyn had wanted, saying: “I do not break the whip lightly. I respect our Labour leadership in the Lords and I value loyalty. But I have also said that the virtue, in excess, fills graveyards.“In this case, not continuing in the EEA would mean endangering, sacrificing, thousands of skilled and decently paid jobs and, with them, the life chances of countless families and communities.”Kinnock, who led Labour between 1983 and 1992, added: “The objections to supporting EEA membership from some in the upper reaches of the Labour party seem to centre on claims that it would either restrict a Labour government’s freedom of socialist action or that it would mean ignoring our supporters who voted to leave the EU, or both.“The first of these claims is based on falsehood. The EEA is open to member states of the EU or the European Free Trade Association.“Neither the EEA nor the EU are part of the socialist superstate of neocon delusion or of the global capitalist adventure playground of infantile leftist illusion.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d66b96cef2d907733ac3446ebaacc240ab09d4de/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3e740218b90591cad515fa14ca019f0","title":"tuc march for new deal for workers draws thousands in london","story":"Event to highlight pay squeeze is set to be the largest rally in the capital for four yearsThousands of people have gathered for a major demonstration in central London to call for a “new deal” for workers and public services.Union members and campaigners from across the UK have travelled to the capital for the TUC rally, where Jeremy Corbyn and the leaders of the Britain’s main unions are scheduled to speak.A decade on from the financial crisis, real wages are still worth £24 a week less than they were in 2008 and are not expected to return to pre-crash levels until 2025, according to the TUC.At that point, real wages in the UK will have been in decline for 17 years, during which time the average worker will have lost out on about £18,500 in real earnings.Frontline workers including nurses, ambulance crews, postal workers, teachers, civil servants and cleaners were marching to call for a higher minimum wage, a ban on zero-hours contracts and more funding for the NHS, education and other public services.The TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said ahead of the march: “UK workers are suffering the worst pay squeeze for two centuries. It’s taking wages longer to recover from this crash than from the great depression and second world war. “This means families are struggling to get by. Millions of kids are growing up in poverty despite having parents in work. Mums and dads are skipping meals and turning to dodgy lenders to make ends meet. “That’s why tens of thousands are marching today for a new deal for working people. We need great jobs in every region and nation of the UK, and higher wages for all workers, not just the bosses.” The march was set to be the biggest demonstration since the last major TUC rally in London four years ago. Corbyn is expected to say that the Labour party will always “proudly support” working people coming together and organising to transform their workplaces. He will say: “In government, we will give workers and employees more power at work, by strengthening their rights and freedoms to organise together to improve their lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e6d1a8e37115df12bdf532f04ea5aa54fcf6fa3/622_196_4953_2971/master/4953.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ae2a3235869f260ba5812c5fd77f953","title":"children exploited county lines gangs need help mother says","story":"‘Helen’ criticises lack of support after her son was groomed and made to sell drugs in rural areasHelen’s son Tom went from being a well-behaved teenager who received good grades at the grammar school he attended, to a boy his mother did not recognise. He started lying about where he had been and became defensive when asked questions knives began going missing from the kitchen and money would turn up in his bedroom.“Odd items started appearing in the house like money and cigarettes – he used to be very anti-smoking. Then he suddenly went missing for more than a week. That’s when things took a turn in a different direction,” Helen says.Tom was eventually found by police, who told Helen her son had been groomed by a gang. From that point on, Tom fell deeper into the murky world of “county lines” drug trading, in which young people are recruited by dealers who offer them money to sell drugs in out-of-town locations.“He was always 10 steps ahead of everyone. Everyone’s hands were tied and we did not know how to find him or where he was. It was extremely frustrating,” Helen says.“He was exploited and he was a victim, but we were told he was choosing this lifestyle of criminality.” She says this attitude stopped Tom from being referred to the national referral mechanism under modern slavery laws, which ensures they receive appropriate support. “That is a big failure by professionals and it stops kids.”Last year, Tom nearly died after being stabbed, but such assaults are not uncommon in county lines. The National Crime Agency reported last year that county lines groups “impose high levels of violence, including the prevalent use of weapons and firearms to intimidate and control members of the group and associated victims”.Helen says a lot of stabbings are the result of turf wars, and social media is also a trigger. “There is a feeling of not valuing their own lives. They are prepared to lead a short life as long as it is a life of bling and status. They don’t care if they are not going to live a long and healthy life ... When you have that situation, where someone is prepared to die young ... how do you compete with that?” she says.She adds that since being stabbed, Tom has changed but she is not sure it is enough to make him quit that lifestyle. “We are having better conversations now, and he has been unreachable for a long time. When you are involved in these gangs you are taught to hate the police and to hate your parents. I am grateful we can communicate relatively well now.”But escaping county lines dealing is not straightforward. “They say eight ways in and one way out,” Helen says.The experience has taken a heavy toll on the family. “He bears no resemblance to my own son, he is a different human being. Lots of parents would not be able to deal with that and it’s easy to throw your child out in that situation, but I knew he hadn’t chosen the lifestyle. He had been groomed and whatever happened had been done to him,” Helen explains.What does she think of how the problem is being tackled by the government? She believes not enough people like her, who have lived through it, are being consulted on how to combat it.“The strategies around tackling serious violence don’t often involve listening to those who have lived it. But we should for our children. We owe it to them if an experience highlights a flaw in the system, people should pay attention and ask ‘where are we going wrong and how can we fix it?’” • All names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa3e570e1a5dbcedc2108434f59698451abf69ef/0_105_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c478185105b38f73ff73d9607a51080","title":"stuart lancaster england leinster racing 92 champions cup final","story":"Former England coach will seek redemption for his international disappointments when Leinster take on Racing 92 in Saturday’s Champions Cup final in BilbaoFor more than 12 centuries pilgrims have travelled to northern Spain in search of spiritual fulfilment and emotional comfort. Stuart Lancaster has only to alight from Leinster’s team bus at Bilbao’s San Mamés stadium rather than walk the trail to Santiago de Compostela but, after two-and-a-half years, his journey to professional redemption is finally complete.The Champions Cup final against Racing 92 is not just about one man but it is a particularly resonant day for England’s erstwhile coach. The last must-win showpiece games his family attended were in 2015 when England were bowing out of their home World Cup at Twickenham. A big occasion for rugby lovers in Dublin, Paris and the Basque country also marks a personally significant return to the sunlit uplands for Lancaster and his wife, Nina, their two children, parents and friends.Those who assume sacked English coaches simply shrug their shoulders and ease into another highly paid role are oblivious to the stark reality. Cumbrian farmers’ sons never wallow in self pity but even Lancaster’s positivity drained away during 2016 when he was jobless with no clear route back into top-level rugby. This week, in a small room on Dublin’s south side, it all finally came tumbling out. “The main thing was a lack of purpose. Not having a team to coach was really eating away at me, not being able to put anything right and just having to sit there thinking about it. It is very difficult when you are out of work.”But for a series of unexpected coincidences, he might still be in Leeds agonising over what might have been. The first emerged on the eve of the 2016 domestic season when Leinster’s defence coach, Kurt McQuilkin, headed back to New Zealand at short notice because his sister was ill. By sheer luck Lancaster used to play with Simon Easterby, Ireland’s forwards coach, whose brother Guy was the Leinster manager. When Lancaster’s name first came up in the Ireland office, the nearest man across the desk was Andy Farrell, previously a member of his England coaching staff.Even now Lancaster sounds immensely grateful: “If this role hadn’t come up, I don’t know how it would have played out. There was certainly nothing else in the pipeline. There was no time for ‘Am I or am I not good enough to be coaching at this level?’ It was a case of: ‘You’re in because we’re at Glasgow on Friday.’”The existence of direct flights from Leeds to Dublin also avoided having to uproot his two children, Sophie and Dan, from their A-level studies. All those dawn airport dashes through the snow to catch his twice-weekly flights have been worth it. At his first team meeting, Lancaster told the players they could win in Europe – “My opening line was: ‘I think we can do great things here’”– and now they are 80 minutes from doing so for the first time since 2012. Their still-improving squad are increasingly the envy of Europe and the players are glowing about Lancaster’s technical input. Among the believers is their tactical kingpin Johnny Sexton, another instrumental figure in his recruitment.“Johnny texted me and said: ‘Let me know what you need me to do to help get it over the line.’ That is pretty powerful coming from a guy who we’d played against five times with England.”Which begs several tantalising questions. Could it be that Lancaster would make a better international coach now than the less experienced model hired by England after the incident-packed 2011 World Cup campaign in New Zealand? Ireland have already drafted in Farrell and, after 2019, there are likely to be a number of vacancies in all sorts of interesting places.Alternatively – “I really enjoy the day-to-day element of club coaching” – could this most approachable and personable of sporting figures may yet conclude he is naturally more suited to club and provincial team preparation? As things stand, it gives him the same match-day buzz without the managerial distractions that restricted the amount of hands-on coaching he did with England. Wherever he goes next, he has promised not to make that same mistake again.Not being the formal number one – with Leo Cullen the Leinster director of rugby – also does not bother him. “I am quite happy to take on responsibility and decision-making if needs be but I don’t have to be the number one. Wayne Smith is a good example. He was coaching New Zealand, then he went to Northampton, then he came back and worked under Graham Henry. I don’t want to give the impression I wouldn’t want to go back and be a number one at some point but it works at the moment for me. As long as I’ve got a strong role that would be fine.”He does admit that watching England from afar can still be tricky, particularly when a Leinster-heavy Ireland beat his former charges at Twickenham in March. “You can’t help but look and see how the team are doing. You are so invested in it.” Lancaster’s team never lost three championship games on the trot or finished fifth but he remains faithful to the players.“England are still a great team. I wouldn’t read too much into the Six Nations, it came down to small margins. I would never not want England to do well, particularly when I know how hard the players worked in 2012-15. What happened in the World Cup hurts them just as much as it hurts me.”Ah, the World Cup. Maybe a Leinster win would alleviate some of the pain that clearly lingers. “Obviously I still look back with huge regret that we didn’t do better. Things didn’t go well for about half an hour of the Wales game and that changed everything.”In a results-based business, the fallout was never going to be pretty. “It’s tough, particularly for my parents, when criticism is coming your way. I would look at other coaches and feel for them because it’s difficult to get back.”All of which makes his family’s presence – minus his daughter who turned 18 this week – in the San Mamés stands all the more special. Despite his protests to the contrary – “It’s more about repaying Leinster than vindication” – one of modern sport’s most heart-warming comeback stories now awaits its conclusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c65dcac07101eb13de9532e7d43813c1f49862b1/145_359_3700_2220/master/3700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61a7e799918289f47a71e6271b9e9419","title":"county cricket surrey v yorkshire somerset v hampshire and more live","story":"Worcestershire are set for a first-innings lead against Essex at New Road, with them currently 161-5 in reply to 177. Joe Clarke is unbeaten on 61 and, like Keaton Jennings over at Trent Bridge, is chasing a second successive century after a big one here at the Oval last weekend. Lancashire have reached lunch at 281-7, a lead of 148 over Notts with Jennings unbeaten on 111. The visitors lost Jordan Clark just before the break to Jake Ball. Somerset have lost two more since Vic’s post and go into lunch at 86-4 against Hampshire (231) at Taunton.In Division Two, Derbyshire are 397-7 against Durham at the County Ground, with a quartet of half-centuries for Ben Slater, Wayne Madsen, Billy Godleman and Matt Critchley. A trio of low-scoring crackers at Canterbury, Grace Road and Edgbaston are joined by Middlesex’s 455-8 against Gloucestershire at Lord’s. Sussex are 118-5 in reply to Kent’s 215 – Matt Henry has four wicket – while Glamorgan are 148-7 in reply to Leicester’s 191. Leaders Warwickshire are 203-8 in reply to Northants 256. Meanwhile, here at the Oval, I have heard the odd whisper that this rain may be hanging around for the rest of the day. Fingers crossed, that does not happen.Lunch at the Oval has arrived 10 minutes early due to rain, with Yorkshire at 40-3. I suspect it may also delay us after lunch as well given the ground staff are covering the whole square. This weather is not entirely unexpected. We have been playing under overcast skies all morning. When play does resume, Joe Root will resume on 14, including a couple of boundaries – a square drive off Jade Dernbach, who he later dabbed through the slips to third-man.Greetings (belated) from Taunton. I’ve not missed a ball but have been distracted (old players’ dinner last night and there are still a few around, then lost my glasses). More importantly the game is moving on with some rapidity.Hampshire had an early morning flurry to be bowled out for 231 and Somerset are currently 68-2. Just as significant as the figures is an injury to Kyle Abbott, the South African seamer, who has left the field. Conditions were useful for him, but chasing a ball at mid-off he turned an ankle. He left the field immediately and has not been sighted since, a major blow to Hampshire.The ball is still swinging and two of Somerset’s youngsters have departed to fine deliveries. Eddie Byrom was bowled by Fidel Edwards and George Bartlett caught at slip off Brad Wheal. Matt Renshaw, who, I discover, when he opened his locker upon arrival at Taunton, found it bulging with sandpaper, has played some cracking shots – an uppercut six among them, has also had some luck he was dropped on 15 behind the wicket and was very close to lbw against Edwards.If Somerset can occupy the crease for a while expect captain James Vince to do some bowling, hoping to emulate the heroics of Tom Abell on Friday. They do not appear to be set on crease occupation at the moment however. Renshaw and Hildreth are playing lots of shots … and he’s just been caught at slip off Berg for 36. It’s 71-3.At Trent Bridge, Keaton Jennings has his second successive Lancashire century having hit one in the draw against Somerset at Old Trafford last week. This one, a patient effort, looks highly likely that it will contribute to more for a Red Rose side still searching for their first win. In reply to Notts 133, he has helped them to 259-6. He is partnered at the crease by Jordan Clark, who has 29. The Lancashire lead is 126 and counting.Here, Che Pujara has just fallen to Sam Curran for 17, caught at second slip – low catch for Scott Borthwick. Yorkshire are 34-3 with Joe Root on nine and Harry Brook yet to get off the mark. Crikey, Joe Root is at the crease already. Alex Lees fell for a golden duck, caught at third slip off Jade Dernbach, before Adam Lyth (six) was trapped lbw by Sam Curran, leaving Yorkshire at 7-2 after four overs. To add to the drama, Che Pujara has just cut the first ball of the fifth over the slips for six. 13-2 now. … as Amar Virdi is superbly caught at third slip by Jack Leaning off Tim Bresnan. Ollie Pope finishes unbeaten on 158.Elsewhere, a morning wicket for Stuart Broad at Trent Bridge, with Lancashire’s Dane Vilas caught and bowled. Keaton Jennings is 71 out of 196-5 in reply to 133. Hampshire have been bowled out for 231 at Taunton. They started the day eight down. In Division Two, there’s early trouble for leaders Warwickshire, who have lost two morning wickets and are 145-6 against Northants, who made 256. New Zealand’s Dough Bracewell has four wickets to go with 81.Yorkshire have struck in the opening 15 minutes to remove Conor McKerr for 29, ending a partnership of 81 with Ollie Pope for the eighth wicket. McKerr aimed a big booming drive at Tim Bresnan, only to see it scurry through to Adam Lyth at second slip. He couldn’t cling on to the catch but parried it up towards first slip, where Che Pujara ed to complete the catch. That wicket fell at 373, but Surrey are now 388-8 and Pope is on 145, equalling his career best. … where it is dry but overcast ahead of day two between Surrey and Yorkshire. Day one didn’t always look like being a dominant day for the hosts, who turned things around courtesy of Ollie Pope’s unbeaten 131 – remember the name! The 20-year-old scored his third first-class hundred, his second this season, in just his 10th match and was helped out by contrasting half-centuries from watchful Dean Elgar and belligerent Rikki Clarke. Surrey were 69-4 and 162-6 either side of lunch before ending the day on 366-7, with Joe Root’s Yorkshire under the cosh.Pope will bat with the tail this morning and hopefully look to carry on a carefree approach which he adopted once passing three figures last night. A couple of milestones of note yesterday 10,000 first-class runs for Clarke and 400 wickets for Jack Brooks. Both excellent performers over the years. Brooks’s milestone is made all the more impressive given he didn’t make his debut until mid-2009. Wickets tumbled around the country. Lancashire are in control against leaders Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in the battle of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. Anderson took two wickets in Notts 133 all out, but Broad is yet to strike in their reply of 157-4. Worcestershire are 47-0 against champions Essex at New Road, with the visitors bowled out for 177. Alastair Cook top-scored with 37 on a mixed day for England’s Test incumbents and hopefuls. James Vince hit 44 for Hampshire against Somerset at Taunton, where rain meant only 58.1 overs were bowled. Hampshire will begin day two on 158-8.In Division Two, Dawid Malan posted 76 for Middlesex against Gloucestershire at Lord’s, as did Eoin Morgan in a rare Championship appearance. Nick Gubbins made 99 in 356-6. After last weekend’s ‘snatch defeat from the jaws of victory’ act for Leicestershire against Durham at the Riverside, things are going from bad to worse at Grace Road. Glamorgan are 82-0 replying to 191.Ben Slater, Wayne Madsen and Billy Godleman hit fifties for Derbyshire in their 301-4 against Durham at Derby, while Kent and Sussex look to be involved in an intriguing low-scoring clash at Canterbury. Kent’s 215 plays Sussex’s 69-4. Kent’s New Zealand quick Matt Henry has continued his excellent start to the season with three wickets.Finally, leaders Warwickshire are 100-4 replying to Northamptonshire’s 256, a significant triumph having been 102-7. Steven Crook and Doug Bracewell their heroes with wickets and runs.Away from the county scene, fingers crossed for a successful day at Malahide, where Ireland have just got life as a Test nation under way against Pakistan following yesterday’s rain.

In these milder months, there’s no excuse not to be outside as much as possible. Here are nine ideas for inspiration.Ride a waveThe north Cornwall coast, with its big Atlantic seas, is Britain’s premier surf destination, with Fistral beach at Newquay probably the country’s best-known surf beach. But there are great places to learn to surf all around the UK. If you’re after a board experience with a less steep learning curve, stand-up paddleboarding offers the chance to take to the water in an easy-to-learn fashion. As well as the exhilaration of surfing the waves, paddleboarding can be a means of exploring the wonders of Britain’s tranquil inland waterways.Get started: Surfing England (surfingengland.org) has information on surf clubs and learning to surf. The British Stand Up Paddle Association website (bsupa.org.uk) has information on where to learn.See colours in bloomSpring and summer are the best times to explore England’s most glorious gardens. Among the Royal Horticultural Society’s (RHS) stunners is its flagship garden, Wisley in Surrey. Home to one of the world’s largest plant collections, it’s a riot of flowering bulbs and blossoms in spring, with fragrant roses and colourful mixed borders in summer. The RHS also runs summer flower shows around the country, including the world-famous Chelsea flower show. The National Trust is  to more than 200 gardens and landscaped parks, many attached to its historic houses, with Studley Royal water gardens at Fountains Abbey, also a world heritage site, among the best known.Freewheel through forest trailsZip along peaceful country lanes between summer hedgerows, pedal past glowering mountains above Scotland’s Glencoe pass as part of a tour or expedition, race with other cyclists, or even head off-road along forest trails on a mountain bike. Cycling can provide high-adrenaline sport or light, relaxing exercise, but whichever way you ride, getting on a bike gives you an up-close view of the countryside that you’d never get from a car.Get started: Cycling UK (cyclinguk.org) can help you get on the road, with advice on everything from buying a bike to cycling groups and routes.Escape to the countryCity dwellers craving a rural fix should seek out one of the many regional annual outdoor shows, a celebration of farming and rural life, with sheep and cattle competitions, horse and dog shows, sheep-shearing contests and farm machinery displays. These days, though, the events are also packed with family-friendly entertainments, ranging from air displays and carriage-driving races to skateboarding and marching bands. Local producers showcase their food and drink, and makers display arts and crafts.Get started:UK County Shows (ukcountyshows) has countrywide information and links to inidual shows.Swim in scenic surroundingsWhat could be a more perfect summer idyll than plunging into a cool lake or river on a hot, sunny day? Wild swimming – taking a dip in rivers, lakes, streams and waterfalls – has a growing number of fans. Popular spots to swim include Ullswater in the Lake District and lochs throughout Scotland, while rivers in the Brecon Beacons are home to stunning waterfall plunge pools. In the south of England, Pangbourne on the river Thames is one of many popular locations, and there are even urban swims to be had in London’s Serpentine and Highgate ponds.Get started: There’s information on locations throughout the UK and all-important safety tips tips at wildswimming.Soar into the treetopsThere’s a special kind of thrill to hurtling through the treetops suspended on a wire. Locations range from urban parks (such as Heaton Park in Manchester and Battersea Park in London) to mountains and forests. Zip World, with locations in Wales, offers a variety of adventures through forest, over a quarry and even – this one’s for the fitter and more adventurous – underground in caverns. Go Ape has locations throughout England, Scotland and Wales, and a collection of mainly forest-based attractions.Kayak along the waterwaysBritain has thousands of miles of rivers, lakes, reservoirs and canals canoeing (single-ended paddle), or kayaking (double-ended paddle), is a great way to explore them. Assuming you don’t have your own canoe, you’ll need to join a club or go to an activity centre, where staff will generally help new paddlers with an induction session. Sea kayaking is a lot of fun, too, and more experienced paddlers may enjoy canoe polo (just as it sounds) or white-water canoeing. Get started: British Canoeing (britishcanoeing.org.uk) has information on canoe clubs and activity centres around the country, and on canoe hire.Walk this wayWhether it’s a Sunday stroll or a serious hike, there’s no simpler – or cheaper – way to explore Britain’s great outdoors than on foot. The British countryside is laced with public footpaths all you need to get going is a pair of walking boots or sturdy trainers (plus a map and weatherproof gear if you’re going far). Among myriad footpaths, 16 national trails pass through some of the country’s most iconic landscapes. They include the South West Coast Path, with 630 miles of trails snaking around the Dorset, Devon, Cornwall and Somerset coasts, and northern England’s hilly Pennine Way.Get started: National Trails (nationaltrail).

From learning to hand-tie a spring wedding bouquet to perfecting a festival-ready floral crown, this is the place to go this summer for cutting-edge botanical design. The highlight in the programme has to be The Foragers Garden Party workshop, which caters to all al fresco needs, from rustic barbecues to afternoon tea. Bring it on.narcissusflowers 21 June (and various dates)Learn a new craftStep away from the sandy beaches and seafood and head straight to The Studio at Burlingham Hall in Norfolk to get your hands – rather than your toes – dirty this summer. Artist Victoria Hall runs a two-day workshop for beginners in the art of paper marbling at this picturesque country estate. You’ll learn about the history, get familiar with watercolours, and tackle various paper patterns (including curl and comb designs). In fact, you’ll have a range of eclectic designs under your belt by the end. And if you don’t leave feeling like a born-again artist, you’ll certainly have the materials to make some pretty alternative Christmas cards.burlinghamhall 16-17 AugustGo down to the woodsHead to the Latitude festival for late-night poetry, light installations, and the biggest comedy, theatre, and arts line up in its 12-year history. Held in Suffolk’s picturesque Henham Park, Latitude is renowned for its eclectic arts programme, with a bit of yoga and lake swimming thrown in for good measure. This year it’s all about Bridget Christie and Tim Key in the comedy selection, while the Killers and Alt-J are definitely headliners to be reckoned with. But it’s the addition of enigmatic music and fashion icon Solange to the bill – her first time heading up a UK festival – that’ll be a real feast of the senses.latitudefestival 12-15 JulyFill up at a foodie festivalIs your idea of heaven on a hot day hitting up a beer garden? Then Pub in the Park is for you. Launched last summer by chef Tom Kerridge to celebrate great British chefs, pubs and music, this year sees the festival go on tour. There are four locations – Higginson Park in Marlow, Royal Victoria Park in Bath, Dunorlan Park in Tunbridge Wells and Knutsford, Cheshire – to choose from. Dishes from Kerridge’s own Michelin-starred Marlow pubs The Hand and Flowers and The Coach will pop up at the four festivals, alongside others from throughout Britain, and there’ll be chef demonstrations and a whole foodie village to shop in. Let’s not forget the soundtrack – brought to you live by the likes of Tom Odell and Razorlight.www.pubintheparkuk various dates between 17 May and 9 SeptemberSee a film under the starsIf you see one film this summer, just make sure it is outdoors. When it’s warm outside (and even when it’s not) there is no shortage of quirky film events, but Picnic Cinema – run by the arts organisation and charity Eden Arts, in Penrith, Cumbria – pulls out all the stops. You can dress up, bring your own picnic (the clue is in the title), and even sleep over. With music, dancing and surprise entertainment, amid spectacular scenic views, you may even forget you’re there to watch a film. Last year, revellers got suitably attired for Pulp Fiction, Withnail and I and The Wicker Man so we can’t wait to see what this year has in store. Just don’t forget your torch.picniccinema various datesJoin the circusIf you’ve ever dreamed of running away with the circus, now’s your chance. To mark 250 years since “the father of modern circus”, Philip Astley, pioneered this industry in London in 1768, Somerset House (in conjunction with Somerset House-based creative producers Crying Out Loud) will present two weekends of contemporary circus, hip-hop dance and music in the iconic grounds.

Not that you’ll have much time to sit with your head in a book at Hay festival Wales, where Margaret Atwood leads a stellar line up of about 800 inspirational, thought-provoking discussions and panels. She’ll speak on The Handmaid’s Tale and beyond, while Philip Pullman, joined by Marina Warner and folklore academic Jack Zipes, promise tales of wonder, magic, and hope.

It’s a special one, marking 50 years since its inauguration, and as a result, the festival has been appealing for stories from anyone who was there in 1968, watching Jefferson Airplane and T Rex et al.

Hastening the country’s giddy descent into feudal, flag-waving battiness, the broadcast media is indulging in displays of royal arse-licking not seen since the court of Queenie in Blackadder II. All this and not even a bank holiday to show for it. I ask you.Conjecture is the order of the day, as evidenced in last week’s Diana to Meghan: Royal Wedding Secrets (Channel 5), the title of which promised something scurrilous but in fact yielded royal biographers Andrew Morton and Penny Junor spouting the purest slurry and designer Elizabeth Emanuel reliving the creation of Diana’s wedding dress while mournfully clutching offcuts. There was ITV’s Invitation to a Royal Wedding, in which Trevor McDonald and Julie Etchingham promised a wedding “unlike any we’ve seen”, all the while standing like planks outside Windsor Castle in their wedding clobber. And who could have overlooked Prince Harry’s Story: Four Royal Weddings, also on ITV, a hagiographical portrait documenting the prince’s boulder-strewn journey from bereaved child to swastika-sporting booze-hound to generally likable human being?There will, of course, be plenty more of this. The coming week brings a rich smorgasbord of WTF programming, including When Harry Met Meghan: A Royal Romance (Saturday, 7pm, Channel 4), in which we get the lowdown on Meghan’s humble beginnings, and Meet the Markles (Tuesday, 10pm, Channel 4), which finds YouTube star Amelia Dimoldenberg travelling to Florida to track down the Markle family. Meanwhile, Extreme Cake Makers (Sunday, 4.25pm, Channel 4) and First Dates (Thursday, 10pm, Channel 4) will both be undergoing royal makeovers. Amid this sea of sycophancy sits an island of sanity in the form of The Windsors Royal Wedding Special (Tuesday, 9pm, Channel 4). Its mere existence should earn it some sort of commemorative plate.Elsewhere in our new red, white and blue televisual universe, expect “friends” of the bride, ie randoms who once picked up her coffee cup by accident on a film set, to languish on TV sofas and share their intimate memories of Meghan, and montages to be played and replayed of horses and carriages, soldiers sweating in bearskins, guests in awful hats and royal superfans parked outside the palace sporting union jack vests and radioactive sunburn. Assume the brace position as Nicholas Witchell, smug overlord of all things royal, takes up residence on the Mall, causing flowers to wilt within a three-mile radius through sheer force of his banality. If ever there was a threat to the future of the monarchy, it’s this guy.And gird yourself for the interminable chuntering of royal “experts”, namely the columnists, the biographers, the ex-butlers and bodyguards currently undergoing emergency teeth-whitening treatment before hightailing it from one studio to the next crying God for Harry, and hailing the wonderful boost to the nation that is this display of richness by very rich people. By jove, it’ll be glorious. One nation under the royals. Brexit? What Brexit?

The attorney general, Jeremy Wright, told the House of Commons that the prime minister Theresa May had written to Belhaj and Boudchar to apologise for the “appalling” treatment they had received.After the statement, Straw conceded publicly for the first time that he had authorised some of MI6’s actions, despite previously telling MPs that allegations of his involvement in rendition were conspiracy theories. Rifkind, a former chairman of the ISC who served in various cabinet roles under Margaret Thatcher and John Major, told the BBC: “I think it’s absolutely vital and in the public interest that the role of the prime minister and ministers at the time in this affair should become better understood. “Tony Blair was prime minister. He has been uncharacteristically silent, so far as I am aware not a word has he said. Jack Straw said he would love to give evidence to the ISC on those matters relevant to national security where he can’t speak openly.“What is not known is the extent to which the then prime minister and other ministers were party to what MI6 was doing. And we know that Mr Blair took a very strong personal interest in Libya.”Belhaj and Boudchar fought a protracted legal battle over their claim that they were kidnapped and returned to Gaddafi’s regime in a move linked to Blair’s infamous “deal in the desert” with the Libyan leader. “They could quite easily come to the judgment either that ministers, in their view, did not know, or were not involved, or that ministers were ... right up to their necks, as it were. “There will be no reason of national security why either the involvement of the prime minister, or ministers, or their non-involvement, should not be, not only investigated, but the results announced to parliament and to the wider public.” He added that the committee had the right to decide on its own authority whether to carry out such an investigation. During the 2011 Libyan revolution, documents also came to light revealing MI6’s role in the rendition of a second Libyan opposition figure, Sami al-Saadi, who was kidnapped along with his wife and four young children. Straw has said he would be happy to give evidence to the ISC, stating that he sought to act at all times in a manner consistent with his legal duties while foreign secretary. But that would be done behind closed doors, and MPs have called for Straw to give evidence before parliament about his role in the kidnap and mistreatment of the two families. Human rights groups, meanwhile, say there needs to be a broader inquiry, independent of government.

One day he would tell his story, challenging those who saw his family only as refugees, defined by the war they had survived. Eight months later, he has become a published author. His book, Homes: A Refugee Story, is set to be officially released on Saturday 12 May by an Edmonton book publisher.“It’s unbelievable, to be honest,” says Abu Bakr, 17. “I can’t believe it.” News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can follow up with our Further Reading guides and can also recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThe book captures his experience of growing up in the Middle East. He was nine when his family moved from Iraq to Syria to escape escalating tensions between Sunni and Shia Muslims. A year later civil war broke out in Syria, punctuating memories of being surrounded by family and playing video games with the horror of car bombings, attacks on schools and late-night explosions.“I really want people to know about what’s happening back home,” says Abu Bakr. “Not just about the war, we also had some good times with family and friends. Even in the hard times we had some good memories.”He wrote the book with Winnie Yeung, the schoolteacher with whom he first shared his dream. Initially they planned a short presentation for his peers. “I could tell he was feeling quite alienated,” says Yeung. “He was saying that his fellow classmates really had no idea where Syria is, or what’s going on in the Middle East. They were asking him: ‘Do you have chairs in classrooms there?’”With permission from his parents, the pair got to work. Using the few English words he knew at the time, he began sharing all he could remember of his childhood. Yeung soon realised that their project was bigger than a class presentation.“I wanted to write it out as a story, so that I could put it in his hands and say: ‘This is your life, you can move on from this,’” she says. “This is part of a really important past and you should be proud for living this life and living it so well.”During lunch hours and after lessons, Yeung would frantically scribble notes as Abu Bakr recounted his childhood. Struggling to navigate the language barrier between them, they got creative. “There was a lot of charades and pantomiming,” says Yeung. “I got a lot of things wrong, we misunderstood each other quite a bit. It took so long to get the stories right.”Google Translate became their go-to app. They looked up events on YouTube and news websites, transporting Abu Bakr back to the streets of Homs through Google Earth’s street view. The two spent hours browsing through mobile phone photos, selfies and online images, trying to identify key details. “Especially with the weaponry, Abu Bakr didn’t know the English words, or even the Arabic,” she says. “So we would look at a bunch of different images online and then he would go: ‘This one.’ And I would learn what it’s called.”Yeung, who learned “the most basic” Arabic, also spent hours interviewing his family in order to contextualise his experience. Born and raised in Edmonton, the project became a crash course for her in conflict. “I barely even watch war movies,” she said. “Part of my late-night internet research would be: OK, how do soldiers carry the AK-47? What are the parts of that weapon? I found myself reading army field manuals.”At times the stories pouring out of Abu Bakr, a young man with an easy smile and warm laugh, left her in shock. The horrors of war were woven into the fabric of his childhood memories: flying homemade kites amid the rubble of destroyed buildings, playing with bullet casings he found on the street. “It was so matter of fact for him, so normal.” His story, she realised, was not just one of living through a war, but also of the deep bonds that sustained his family through their turbulent journey. For Abu Bakr, the book became an anchor as he worked to find his place in his new home, helping him improve his English and meet residents from across the city.He hopes the book will help keep attention on the crisis unfolding in the Middle East, offering a glimpse into the personal experience of one refugee at a time when the number of people fleeing war and persecution around the globe has reached record highs.“I really hope people will read my story and enjoy it,” he said. “And I hope they will get the main idea of it – how hard it is leaving home and how hard it is to live in a civil war.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Riot police were stationed outside the gate where people believed Najib would enter.After losing the election this week to the opposition, led by former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, there had been concerns that Najib would try to flee the country to avoid the chance of prosecution for his role in the 1MDB scandal, which he was accused of covering up while in office. Mahathir has pledged a full independent investigation into the billions of embezzled funds and many believe this will implicate Najib.Mahathir confirmed he had already ordered the 1MDB investigation files to no longer be restricted under the Official Secrets Act. “They will then submit the report to me and I will study it,” he told a press conference on Saturday.Speaking about the re-opened 1MDB investigation Mahathir said: “We want to do it as quickly as possible.” “It is a very complex thing because it involves a lot of people, it involves a lot of decisions made, and the money you know has to be investigated as to the money laundering,” he added. “We have to contact America, Switzerland, Singapore.”By Saturday afternoon, Najib had resigned as the president of his UMNO and as chairman of the Barisan National coalition. “I have a moral responsibility to step down,” he told the party’s Supreme Council. “We all feel sad about what happened but as a party that upholds democratic principles, we accept the people’s decision.”Najib also took to twitter to apologise for his “shortcomings and mistakes”.“After over four decades in politics and the recent election campaign, which was regrettably personal and perhaps the most intense in Malaysian history, I will take a short break to spend time with my family whom I have not seen enough of in recent years,” he wrote.Najib also tweeted that he hoped the “isive period” in the country’s history would end with unity.“I pray that after this isive period, the country will unite. I apologise for any shortcomings and mistakes, and I thank you, the people, for the opportunity to lead our great nation. It has been the honour of my lifetime to serve you and Malaysia.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3486846.1525704399!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"overcome by the pong of a pine marten den count yourself lucky","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPine marten: the distinctive smell of its scat is often described as like that of Parma violets. Illustration: Michael VineyA friend who lives on a windy hilltop, in a house nestled in trees, called to tell of a strange smell in her woodshed. There was something, perhaps, going on in one corner, behind a pile of tools. She had glimpsed a furry tail.This is the season when furry animals have babies – and a leafy hilltop adjoining conifer forestry made the pine marten, notorious for siting its nursery in attics and sheds, the likely candidate.A listen at the door was rewarded by sounds of mewing from the corner, as of kittens. The scatter of droppings on the floor matched that of Martes martes, or the Irish cat crainn. We retreated, happy that Ireland’s rarest mammal, long in slow revival after centuries of decline, was staking out a new domain above the western shore.What might have clinched the matter was the distinctive smell of the scat, so often described as like that of Parma violets, even by people without great experience either of the flower or of the scented English sweet of the same name.As a connoisseur of the musky, unmistakable aroma of otter spraint – sampled from the greenest, best-fertilised tufts of grass on stream banks – I was quite looking forward to a new olfactory experience. The overwhelming fragrance of the shed, however, was that of Jeyes Fluid, my friend being one of many householders repelled by the alternative odour, redolent of violets or not.I did not have to go far online, indeed, to find a blog complaining of “having to move downstairs” to escape the pong of a pine-marten den in a roof space. So mixed, indeed, are responses to these intrusions that the Vincent Wildlife Trust has put a special leaflet online: The Pine Marten in Ireland: A Guide for Householders. It could be prudent reading for people now returning to their rural holiday houses.The shortage of natural den sites in Ireland (notably in trees old enough to have big holes) has made houses and sheds attractive to female martens seeking seasonal warmth and safety. They are a long-protected species, and will abandon their kits if disturbed.The two or three young themselves will want to play by night – martens are largely nocturnal. So their noisy skittering on bedroom ceilings can be unwelcome. But from March to July, action to evict a family could bring prosecution under the Wildlife Act.The Vincent trust readily admits that martens “do not make good house guests” and urges proofing the house against invasion. But the animals are superlative climbers and can squeeze through gaps as big as their head (5cm for females).A second leaflet, supported by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, addresses more of the martens’ misbehaviours. How to eExclude Pine Martens from Game and Poultry Pens describes in detail electric fencing to protect the gun clubs’ pheasant chicks and ways of making a henhouse martenproof.All this may stir questions about what pine martens are “good for” and reinforce the wilder concerns for newborn lambs and babies left out in their prams. The predatory diet of this much-abused native mammal includes neither (except, at times, bits of dead lamb) and embraces even frogs, snails, beetles and blackberries. More helpfully to humans, it is a control on rodent populations and its hunting of rats and mice, bank vole and white-toothed shrew extends even to grey squirrels.This, as recent Irish research has shown, can help restore numbers of the native red squirrel. The red is lighter and more agile, and can retreat to the far ends of branches, while the bigger grey also spends more time on the ground and is easier to catch.This study, carried out in Co Wicklow woods by Dr Emma Sheehy of the University of Aberdeen, found the fur of grey squirrels, but not of reds, in marten scats. It has had wide attention in Britain, where restoration of the marten in Scotland, Wales and northern England and conservation of red squirrels are priorities.In Ireland, meanwhile, the research has been intensive, including genetic study of DNA from marten hairs left in sticky tubes baited with raw chicken. This helped the large-scale assessment of the marten population published last year by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.Led by Dr Declan O’Mahony of Northern Ireland’s Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, the report identified 134 inidual martens at sites spread across the island, with an average low density of about one animal per square kilometre of forest. Combining this with other data, the total population in Ireland was estimated at 3,043. This confirmed the pine marten as a settled and stable resident, but still one of the rarest mammals in Ireland."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3492396.1526111519!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"emma mhic mhath%C3%BAna calls for hse to be dismantled","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmma Mhic Mhathúna: ‘Talk to cheap.

Photograph: Tolga Akmentolga AkmenAFPGetty ImagesThe Government expects British prime minister Theresa May to push ahead with proposals for a new “customs partnership” which it believes could pave the way for a soft Brexit, and which Dublin will support at next month’s European Union summit.The  understands the British government has told Dublin about the proposals, and the Government is likely to back Ms May at the summit.However, Irish support will be forthcoming only if Ms May faces down the hard Brexiteers in her cabinet and her government shows progress on a common understanding of the border “backstop”, the commitment to maintain an open border even without agreement.Downing Street has told Dublin it has problems with the backstop, but that Ms May’s proposals on a customs partnership would lessen the importance of the arrangement.Government sources agree that the potency of the backstop would be decreased and that it would become “less important” for Ms May if she put forward a customs proposal. It would make it “less offensive” to the DUP, which supports Ms May’s government.While further work would be needed on any customs proposal – even if Ms May gets it through her cabinet – it would “point to a direction of travel” from the UK government of where it wants to go, say sources. It would not be “a solution in itself”.The proposal would see British officials collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for an EU member state. The EU has already rejected this model, and a willingness to look afresh – even if it only “provides the basis” for future talks, according to one source – will be seen as a softening of the Irish and EU position. Earlier this week, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said of Ms May’s customs proposal: “The view of the EU is that it isn’t workable in its current form but it is something that perhaps we could make workable.”The backstop – which would ensure no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland without agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border – was agreed in principle in December, although the UK has rejected the EU’s legal interpretation of it.However, in tandem with the customs proposal, the British government must “at a minimum” table its own interpretation of the backstop in the weeks before the June summit.It was further argued that the tabling of a customs proposal would make it easier for the backstop to “go green” – be agreed – and this would “leave space for the legal experts” to iron out the details over the summer.In effect, the mooted move would mean the EU taking Ms May’s proposal seriously in order to help her agree to the backstop. Senior Government figures believe the DUP’s priority is now that the North should be treated no differently to the rest of Britain, even if this means staying in a UK-wide customs partnership which would replicate many of the features of the customs union.DUP leader Arlene Foster has said Northern Ireland must move in “lockstep” with the rest of the UK.Although Ms May has said she could not accept the EU’s interpretation of the backstop, the Government is adamant the fallback option must be included in any Brexit deal. “We still need the backstop,” said a senior Government source."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3493321.1526119050!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leinster rugby fans stranded in dublin due to issue with aircraft","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPassengers wait to board the Aer Lingus flight to Bilbao at Dublin airport this morning.

Anguilla anguilla) to the Sargasso Sea is one of the great animal migrations.It is an arduous 6,500km journey from Europe’s inland waterways for the seriously endangered species which is threatened by historic overfishing and the degradation and loss of its habitats due to land reclamation, the construction of dams and reductions in water quality.And now attempts to conserve the Irish branch of the family have been, at the very least, complicated by, of all things, Brexit, their fate tied to the prospects for maintaining a frictionless border between North and South on the Erne river at Ballyshannon.The decline of eel stocks in Lough Erne, where commercial fishing has been halted, has been attributed in part to the attrition of both elvers entering the river from the Atlantic and of developed silver eels descending from Lough Erne through the turbines of the ESB hydroelectric power station.The EU requires member states to develop eel management plans and to take measures to ensure that at least 40 per cent of adult eels can escape from inland waters to the sea where they spawn. On the Erne that has meant the seasonal deployment of lorries with aerated water tanks to transport trapped live eels around the turbines.The protection of the eel is just one of 142 areas of North-South co-operation that are underpinned by joint obligations to EU regulations and to the Belfast Agreement, and which form a key part of the Irish strand of the Brexit discussions.They are a measure of the complex interdependence of both the cross-Border relationship and the scale and scope of the talks process.For the most part there is no question of the UK wishing to repudiate any of programmes that range from environmental projects to cross-Border hospitals, but EU negotiators and their UK counterparts have to work on legal language to copperfasten their post-Brexit future.The eels – provisions for safeguarding the EU’s management plan and regulating the cross-Border transport of live animals – will have their special place in Annex 2.8 of the Irish protocol to the Brexit orce deal, the Withdrawal Agreement, currently being discussed by the two sides.Discussions about the controversial Border “backstop” – an agreement would fully align Northern Ireland with the rules of the EU to avoid a hard border – have tended to catch the headlines and eclipse what can seem the more humdrum but nevertheless vital issues.As the protocol makes clear, however, the range and detail of the discussions is huge – as well as ensuring free trade in goods, the protocol says it shall also “be implemented and applied so as to maintain the necessary conditions for continued North-South co-operation, including in the areas of environment, health, agriculture, transport, education and tourism, as well as energy, telecommunications, broadcasting, inland fisheries, justice and security, higher education and sport”.Guaranteeing many of these, Irish officials stress, is also dependent on unhindered movement across the Border – the necessity for a Border deal permeates the entire protocol.It also contains provisions to safeguard the Common Travel Area between the Republic of Ireland and the UK, for joint citizenship provisions for Northern Ireland, and to “respect the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent”.It requires the UK to guarantee that there is “no diminution of rights” caused by its departure from the EU, including in the area of protection against forms of discrimination enshrined in EU law.The Irish protocol currently runs to eight pages of the 129-page Withdrawal Agreement, which is now being turned into legal treaty language.The challenge EU leaders have set themselves is to complete broad agreement on the treaty text by June, so that it can be finalised by October and then be put to member states and the European Parliament for ratification ahead of the UK’s departure at the end of March, 2019.The Withdrawal Agreement contains the agreement on transition, or the “implementation period” as the UK calls it, and, like the rest of the text, it stands or falls on agreement on the whole package, including the Irish protocol.The important parallel discussions now under way on the “future relationship” between the EU and UK, essentially the future trading relationship, are also conditional on no “backsliding” on the agreements made in December in the “Joint Report” between the EU and UK which is reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement.Brussels and Dublin are adamant that unless the UK honours its commitment to the “backstop” provision of that December agreement, the future relationship talks will stop and the Withdrawal Agreement and the transition deal will be put in jeopardy.Those talks are set to produce a political outline of a future trading relationship which will be approved with the Withdrawal Agreement, although not having the same legal standing. A trade treaty can be agreed only once the UK is no longer an EU member-state.The Withdrawal Agreement text is colour-coded to reflect different stages of agreement – currently 15 per cent of the protocol is in green, effectively agreed, 37 per cent remains in yellow, on which there is political agreement on objectives but not on drafting, and 47 per cent is white or uncoloured, unagreed. There is much still to do.Most of the protocol white text reflects how the EU sees the operation of the “backstop” arrangement – the Border fallback guarantee should the UK prove unable to come up with and agree with the EU-preferred scenario for preventing a hard border.The Withdrawal Agreement text on safeguarding human rights post-Brexit remains in yellow – the UK is understood to accept in principle that there should be “no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity” in the North. However, the language proposed by the commission remains problematic, and the full enumeration of such rights in the annex to the treaty protocol has yet to be agreed.The range of these rights goes well beyond the issues of discrimination, equality and identity that are traditionally seen as central to the conflict – gender rights legislation, for example, or carers’ rights, or family law arrangements, including custody and maintenance issues, may have their roots in EU legislation.Although most of such regulations will be incorporated automatically into UK law by means of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, campaigners in the North worry over the abandonment by the UK of obligations under the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights.“The EU Charter acts as an important constitutional safeguard underpinning human rights protections in Northern Ireland and its removal weakens the quality and range of human rights protections available here,” the Northern Ireland Human Rights Consortium warns.The EU’s protocol text proposes that “The United Kingdom shall continue to facilitate the related work of the institutions and bodies set up pursuant to the 1998 Agreement, including the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and the Joint Committee of representatives of the Human Rights Commissions of Northern Ireland and Ireland, in upholding human rights and equality standards.”Irish officials are said to be concerned at the lack of specific commitments to ringfence such funding.Other non-Border issues such as UK adherence to EU “state aid” rules – to prevent unfair competition through state subsidies – and the challenge of customs-free “transit” for Irish lorries and goods across the UK to EU markets also remain unagreed.Although not mentioned in the Irish protocol, and in theory an issue for the post-Brexit future relationship talks, because it is an issue of specific concern to Ireland and not other member-states, Irish officials are keen to see the issue taken up in the Irish talks strand.The UK signalled as far back as last August that it is willing to sign up to membership of the Common Transit Convention to facilitate the transit trade in both directions, and there are precedents using seals on lorries. But there are concerns at how the Irish lorries will be able to bypass potentially long customs queues at ports such as Dover. Transit across Northern Ireland will also require maintaining harmonised transport regulations such as recognition of hauliers’ licences.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"dup leader insists free flow with the republic possible after brexit","story":"  May 6, 2018Arlene Foster described as \u0026lsquoreal leader of the Conservative Party\u0026rsquo by senior British Labour figure   May 10, 2018Party publicly panicking as UK plan for EU customs partnership falls apart "},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

The helicopter will have twin, counter-rotating blades which will power through the thin Martian atmosphere at almost 3,000 rpm – about 10 times the rate of a helicopter on Earth.The helicopter has solar cells to charge its lithium-ion batteries, and a heating mechanism to keep it warm through the cold Martian nights.“The altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet. The atmosphere of Mars is only one per cent that of Earth, so when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it’s already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet up,” said Mimi Aung, Mars Helicopter project manager.“To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.”Controllers on Earth will command the Mars Helicopter, through a system of commands send from the ground, rather than a real-time joystick.The full 30-day flight test campaign will include up to five flights of incrementally farther flight distances, up to a few hundred meters, and longer durations as long as 90 seconds. On its first flight, the helicopter will make a short vertical climb to 10 feet, where it will hover for about 30 seconds.Please review our commenting policyHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekPrince Harry and Meghan Markle: Royal wedding details and latest newsAustralia boosts Pacific aid and diplomacy as China influence spreadsPassengers to see which airlines offer most legroom when they bookBritain does not deserve to win Eurovision: Tristram SaundersComment: Iran and America fight, while Russia plots.

Although China is rarely mentioned, we need to be engaged - and if we are not, others will.” A Commonwealth nation which only gained independence from Britain in 1978, Tuvalu has a population of about 11,000, scattered across its nine thin atolls.The main island, Funafuti, is just 60 feet wide in parts. But the remote country has become enmeshed in larger concerns about China’s growing ambitions in the region. “It is as close as you can get to a Pacific paradise ... but you do have to wonder what the diplomats will do every day,” says Graeme Smith, an expert on China’s role in the Pacific at the Australian National UniversityChina and Taiwan have been locked for decades in a chequebook diplomacy war to win the support of small Pacific nations.These island states have scant resources or revenue but have been adept at trading off tensions between China and Taiwan and, more recently, Russia and Georgia.At times the results have been farcical: in 2004, the nation of Vanuatu announced it was switching its diplomatic recognition from China to Taiwan after a promise of aid and then changed back to China eight days later.Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge drink coconut milk from a tree planted by the Queen in 1982 in Funafuti, TuvaluRecently, China has increased efforts to win support from the remaining backers of Taiwan, now numbering fewer than twenty worldwide. The latest was the Dominican Republic, which switched allegiance from Taiwan two weeks ago after Beijing offered it a suite of investments and loans reportedly worth about £2.3 billion.Australia has become increasingly concerned that China’s interests in the south Pacific could extend beyond this diplomatic tug-of-war and could pose a direct security threat.Recently, Fairfax Media reported that China approached Vanuatu about building a permanent military presence – a move that would be seen by Canberra as a serious potential military risk.Both China and Vanuatu denied the claim, though unnamed Australian security officials reportedly remained convinced that Beijing was pursuing military ties. China\u0026#39s aircraft carrier sailing during military drills in the Pacific in 2016Responding to the report, Malcolm Turnbull, Australia’s prime minister, said: “We would view with great concern the establishment of any foreign military bases in those Pacific island countries and neighbours of ours.Britain appeared to share Australia’s concerns, announcing in April that it will open new  high commissions in Vanuatu, Samoa and Tonga. “An increased global footprint will also ensure that Britain and its allies are able to counter the malign influence of countries who seek to undermine the UK,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.China’s aid and investment in small Pacific states has grown sharply and prompted concerns that a failure to repay debts could allow it to claim significant assets  – a scenario that occurred, most notably, in Sri Lanka and left Chinese-owned companies in control of a strategic port.According to research by the Lowy Institute in Sydney, China provided $US1.8 billion in aid and loans to South Pacific nations between 2006 and 2016. .html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Put simply – if we’re not there some other influence will beWinston PetersIn an apparent response, both Australia and New Zealand announced this week large increases in aid across the Pacific. Aside from the Tuvalu embassy, Canberra revealed plans to build an undersea telecommunications cable between Australia, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands.The project, estimated to cost about £80 million, replaced an earlier plan by the Chinese firm Huawei to connect a cable between Solomon Islands and Sydney – a move that worried Australian security agencies.Ms Bishop, Australia’s foreign minister, played down suggestions that this week’s Pacific largesse was motivated by fears of China.But her New Zealand counterpart Winston Peters, not renowned for his diplomatic niceties, was more direct. “Put simply – if we’re not there some other influence will be,” he said. How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekPrince Harry and Meghan Markle: Royal wedding details and latest newsPassengers to see which airlines offer most legroom when they bookBritain does not deserve to win Eurovision: Tristram SaundersComment: Iran and America fight, while Russia plots.

Security is still threatened by sectarian tensions, which erupted into a 2006-2007 civil war at the height of a 2003-2011 U.S. occupation.The election\u0027s victors will have to contend with the fallout from US President Donald Trump\u0027s decision to pull out of the nuclear deal with Iran, a move that raised fears among Iraqis that their country will be a theatre of conflict between Washington and Tehran.Iraq has defeated Isil but is still grappling with corruption and economic hardshipThe three main ethnic and religious groups - the majority Shia Arabs and minority Sunni Arabs and Kurds - have been at odds for decades, and sectarian isions remain as deep as ever even though they joined forces to fight Islamic State.I will participate but I will mark an \u0027X\u0027 on my ballot. There is no security, no jobs, no services. Candidates are just looking to line up their pockets, not to help people, said Jamal Mowasawi, a 61-year-old butcher.The three main candidates for prime minister, all Shia, are incumbent Haider al-Abadi, his predecessor Nuri al-Maliki and Shia militia commander Hadi al-Amiri. All need the support of Iran, which has economic and military sway in Iraq as the primary Shia power in the region.Abadi is considered by analysts to be marginally ahead, but victory is far from certain for the man who raised hopes that he could forge unity when he came to office. His office released photographs of him voting on Saturday morning and going through the same security pat down as other Iraqi voters. In office Abadi reached out to minority Sunnis but alienated Kurds after crushing their bid for independence. He improved his standing with the victory against Islamic State, which had occupied a third of Iraq.But Abadi lacks charisma and has failed to improve the economy and tackle corruption. He also cannot rely solely on votes from his community as the Shi\u0027ite voter base is unusually split this year. Instead, he is looking to draw support from other groups.Even if Abadi\u0027s Victory Alliance list wins the most seats, he still has to negotiate a coalition government, which must be formed within 90 days of the election.Amiri, 63, spent more than two decades fighting Saddam from exile in Iran and leads the Badr Organisation, the backbone of the volunteer forces that fought Islamic State. Victory for Amiri would be a win for Iran, which is locked in proxy wars for influence across the Middle East with Saudi Arabia.But many Iraqis are disillusioned with war heroes and politicians who have failed to restore state institutions and provide badly needed health and education services.There is no trust between the people and the governing class, said Hussein Fadel, a 42-year-old supermarket cashier in the capital. All sides are terrible. I will not vote.Hadi al-Amiri, a Shia militia commander running for prime minister, shows his ink-stained finger after casting his vote at a polling station during the parliamentary election in BaghdadSome people expressed frustrations at technical problems which kept them from voting in Falluja, which used to support Saddam, was devastated by battles between US troops and insurgents during the occupation and is now far from recovering from the war against Islamic State militants.I have to vote it\u0027s very important. My voice is going to waste. Are they telling me no election? Shall I just go home?, asked labourer Khalid Abd, 65.Critics say Maliki\u0027s sectarian policies created an atmosphere that enabled Islamic State to gain sympathy among some Sunnis as it swept across Iraq in 2014.Maliki was sidelined soon afterward, having been in office for eight years, but he is now trying to make a comeback. He is again posing as Iraq\u0027s Shia champion, and has proposed doing away with the unofficial power-sharing model under which all main parties have cabinet representatives.Maliki, who pushed for US troop withdrawals, and Amiri, who speaks fluent Farsi and spent years in exile in Iran during Saddam\u0027s time, are both seen as closer to Tehran than Abadi.More than 7,000 candidates in 18 provinces, or governorates, are running this year for 329 parliamentary seats. More than 24 million of Iraq\u0027s 37 million people are eligible to vote in the election, the fourth since Saddam\u0027s fall.In Kirkuk, the main oil city disputed by Iraq\u0027s Kurds and the Baghdad government, 90-year-old Najm al-Azzawi has witnessed Iraq\u0027s upheaval over many years: Saddam\u0027s military adventures and the crippling international sanctions that followed, the US occupation, sectarian bloodshed and Islamic State\u0027s reign of terror. But he has not lost hope.God save Iraqis from the darkness they have been in, he said.

It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but Harry and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm.The core aspects of the wedding, including the church service, associated music, flowers, decorations and reception, will be paid for by the Royal Family, with Ms Markle’s parents both set to attend.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesFormer Suits star Ms Markle told last year how she could not wait to say yes to the prince when Harry got down on one knee as they cooked a roast chicken dinner at his home, Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.Indicating the depths of his feeling for his bride-to-be, the prince revealed in a television interview: It was this beautiful woman just sort of literally tripped and fell into my life, I fell into her life.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, Windsor. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Royal sources said the guest list will be restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, and was taken both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small, and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.As well a dress code, the Royal guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day. The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Read more about who they are here.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayOther guests will include members of Ms Markle\u0027s family - her mother Doria Radlan and father Thomas Markle Snr - and of course many members of the royal family.Tennis star Serena Williams and Ms Markle\u0027s former Suits co-stars Sarah Rafferty, Patrick J Adams and Wendell Pierce could also be on the list.The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsThe Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince George and Princess Charlotte look almost certain to be page boy and flower girl. The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be seen as part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be making their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999.  The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. They will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.Harry also has to decide whether to wear a wedding ring. William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a “special place” during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.After the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will then undertake a two mile tour of Windsor greeting well-wishers. They will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for their reception.Read more about the procession here.Following the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Scant details have emerged about the receptions so far, but we do know that the couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake.Kensington Palace said Ms Ptak, owner of the Violet Bakery in Hackney, will create a cake for the Royal wedding incorporating the bright flavours of spring. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonIt is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father Thomas Markle choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, is expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle, but may not make a formal speech.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesIn February, one of the five original Spice Girls Mel B hinted that the Spice Girls were expected to reunite for the Royal wedding. The singer, known to fans as Scary Spice, claimed she had received a proper invitation during an appearance on a television chat show.Fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham also appeared to let slip she was attending the big day during an appearance on The Late, Late Show with James Corden earlier in April. Asked if she would be among the guests, she said: I, uh, I, I don\u0027t know...However, it has recently been reported that the Spice Girls have no plans to perform at the wedding, and have not been rehearsing for the event.Victoria and her husband David were invited to the 2011 royal wedding. Prince Harry with the Spice Girls in 1997Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday declared.Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers plan to extend licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on the nights of Friday 18 and Saturday 19 May - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.

The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekAustralia boosts Pacific aid and diplomacy as China influence spreadsPassengers to see which airlines offer most legroom when they bookBritain does not deserve to win Eurovision: Tristram SaundersComment: Iran and America fight, while Russia plots.

The ceremony, which takes place on Saturday May 19, will be held in Windsor it will include two wedding receptions and a carriage procession, as well as the service.Prince Harry and Ms Markle have broken tradition by choosing to hold their wedding on a Saturday, as royal weddings usually take place during the week. The wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge was held on a Friday and the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales was held on a Wednesday on both occasions the public were given an extra bank holiday.While Downing Street have said there are no plans to give Britons a day off for this year\u0027s royal nuptials, pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open until 1am on Friday May 18 and the day of the wedding itself.Amber Rudd, the former Home Secretary, opened a consultation on the plans in January. She said: “The Royal wedding will be a time of national celebration, and we want everyone to be able to make the most of such an historic occasion.“I hope that this relaxation of the licensing hours will allow people to extend their festivities and come together to mark what will be a very special moment for the country.”Here is everything you need to know about how the big day will unfold.The service will take place at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.There, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeMeghan\u0027s father will meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door, before walking her down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd.

If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen to take the photographs on the wedding day. Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father, also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception – although Princess Charlotte and Prince George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekPrince Harry and Meghan Markle: Royal wedding details and latest newsAustralia boosts Pacific aid and diplomacy as China influence spreadsPassengers to see which airlines offer most legroom when they bookBritain does not deserve to win Eurovision: Tristram SaundersComment: Iran and America fight, while Russia plots.

The series follows Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s.It’s perhaps the archetypal image of the cult we’ve come to recognise: the followers of Rajneesh, who died in 1990, dressed in orange their leader was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities) the disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead, lost contact with their families.But cults don’t have to follow the pattern of Rajneeshpuram, as the Oregon ranch was renamed, or the bloodbaths at Jonestown or Waco, where David Koresh’s sect the Branch Davidians was raided by the FBI in 1993. More often than not, they are more mundane than that… but no less damaging.Rajneesh, also known as Osho, with his ‘Orange People’ followers (Netflix)Katy Morgan-Davies last month published a book about her experiences living in Brixton with the cult leader – and her father – Aravindan Balakrishnan, who was jailed on charges of rape and imprisonment in 2015. Morgan-Davies managed to flee the cult in 2013 after 30 years – her entire life.Cults are back in the news again, but for Ian Haworth they never went away. As the head of the UK-based Cult Information Centre, he spends his life collating information on cults, offering advice and help to those who have escaped – or wish to – and campaigns for stricter legislation to control the reach and influence of these malign groups.“I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults,” says Haworth. “That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thing.”Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan (PA)That interest comes in peaks and troughs, naturally, with particular focus at the moment thanks to Wild Wild Country and Morgan-Davies’ memoir. Haworth says: “I suppose the biggest peak we’ve had began on 1 January 1999, when there was a huge amount of cult activity related to the millennium, when all kinds of things were promised or predicted. Of course, mathematically, the millennium ended at the end of the year 2000, not the end of 1999, but cult leaders don’t really care about such things. They care about money, and controlling people, and power.”Born in Lancashire, the son of a farmer, Haworth emigrated to Canada in 1972 while in his twenties. By 1978 he was working as a communications consultant for a large company, and had never given a thought to cults. Aged 31, he happened to be stopped by a woman with a clipboard in a Toronto street.After fleeing a cult in 1978, Ian Haworth has dedicated his life to helping others in the same situation (Cult Information Centre)“She was very attractive and I was very single,” remembers Haworth. “When she asked me if I had time to answer a few questions for what I thought was market research, I said yes.”But after only half a dozen questions, the tone of the exchange altered. The woman told Haworth that his answers indicated he’d fit in very well with a group she was involved with, and that it would enable him to give something back to society rather than just taking. A meeting was taking place the following week and Haworth was invited along.“I turned up and there were about a hundred people there,” he says. “A woman was talking about her addiction to alcohol and drugs, and how this group had helped her. I was planning to sneak away at the end, because I’d been brought up to be polite and didn’t want to just walk out. Then they brought out drinks and cakes, and as I’d paid $2 (£1.50) to attend I decided I might as well get my money’s worth before leaving.”The world of Cults: in picturesThe world of Cults: in picturesAravindan Balakrishnan, known as ‘Comrade Bala’ within the women-only collective he founded 40 years ago, carried out a brutal campaign of sexual degradation against the women over several decades. In this picture, he stands with some of his cult followers including his daughter.

Revealing her real identity, Miss Morgan-Davies said that waiving her anonymity was an important step – “to retrieve the identity the cult tried to steal from me”.\u0026#13PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Evidence picture showing the bedroom of the imprisoned daughter of Aravindan Balakrishnan.

Aravindan Balakrishnan was jailed for 23 years in 2016. To keep his devotees in check, Balakrishnan invented \u0027Jackie\u0027, which he said could kill or trigger earthquakes if anyone went against his will. He claimed that a challenge to his leadership resulted in the 1986 space shuttle disaster and Jackie, an invisible war machine, was responsible for the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour party leader. PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Jim Jones, founder of the Peoples Temple sect in Jonestown, north Guyana, in 1978. Believers of the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ followed Reverend Jones to Guyana in the Seventies, hoping to create a utopia in the jungle. Jonestown was envisaged as a “rainbow family” of all ages and races, the preacher had promised them: “Divine principles. Total equality. A society where people own all things in common, where there is no rich or poor, where there are no races.” APwords by Adam LusherReverend Jones wanted to create a glorious sacrifice, a defiant act of “revolutionary suicide” that would echo through history. Some disciples willingly colluded, cheering as he exhorted them to kill themselves and their children. But the bodies found with bent needles in their arms testified to the fact that some refused and were forcibly injected. Rexwords by Adam LusherWhen they finally counted the bodies after what would become known as the Jonestown massacre of 18 November 1978, the total came to 918, of whom 304 were children. They had been persuaded to “drink the Kool-Aid”, Flavor Aid, used to mask the bitter taste of cyanide, mixed with a dash of Valium.APwords by Adam LusherMaude Julien, now 60, was forced to hold onto an electric fence for without showing feeling as a child. The ritual was considered to be a test of her willpower by her father, who wanted to make her “superhuman”.\u0026#13Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which was built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s. Rajneesh, who died in 1990, was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities). His disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead and lost contact with their families.During a break he went into the corridor for a cigarette, and that’s when the cult members pounced. Haworth had seen his doctor not long before and been told if he carried on smoking like he did he’d be lucky to see 40. The group told him that they would absolutely guarantee he would stop smoking if he attended a further course for $220. He’d already looked into smoking-cessation courses that were of comparable cost, so decided he’d give this one a go.“The course took place in September, 1978,” says Haworth. “By the end of the course I’d given notice at my job, promised to dedicate my life to the cult, and handed over all my savings, which amounted to about $1,500.”Jonestown commune mass suicide in 1978 (AP)Even now, Haworth cannot identify the tipping point that turned him from someone who’d turned up for a meeting at the behest of an attractive woman to someone who gave himself, body and soul, to a cult, other than mid-way through the course when he stopped smoking. “I suppose that was the moment I went over to them – they had done what they said they would do.”Cults often thrive on feeding into people’s desires. Sometimes they will promise success, artistic or creative talent, fulfil a desire in their targets to effect social change or, as with Haworth, to “give something back” to the world. They will promise freedom from addictions or improved physical or mental health. They’re what Haworth calls therapy cults, as opposed to the religious cults that offer more spiritual promises.If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had. You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situationOver the next month, Haworth tried to recruit his friends and even neighbours to the group. They were appalled at the change in him, but, he says, “I thought they were wrong, I knew they weren’t part of the elite, like I was.”It was an almost textbook recruitment, and Haworth firmly believes he would have been lost to everyone who knew him but for one error on the part of the cult. “Most cults programme their members against the media very early on. These people didn’t do that,” he says. And that was what saved him.A neighbour gave him a copy of the Toronto Star which had featured a front-page exposé of the group Haworth was involved in, written by the investigative reporter Sidney Katz. Haworth read the piece and contacted Katz immediately to verify his facts. He then, as he describes it, “fell apart at the seams”. Having seen Katz’s research and evidence first hand, at the invitation of the journalist, Haworth angrily confronted the cult’s leaders, and they effectively banished him. He was finally free of them.“That was in October,” he says. “Then, in the November, everything came out about the Jonestown cult. And I knew that could have been me. It took me 11 months to fully recover and get back to myself.”NXIVM (which calls itself a ‘multi-level marketing organisation’) member Allison Mack leaving US District Court after her bail hearing in Brooklyn (Getty)It took that long for the nagging whispers of “Cult Ian”, as Haworth describes the person he was when he was with the group, to be finally silenced, and for “Real Ian” to reassert himself. And good sense would dictate that was the point he turned his back on cults forever and got on with his life.“I come from a farming background in Lancashire,” says Haworth. “People used to say, ‘If there’s summat up, then tha’ does summat about it’. So I did summat about it.”Sidney Katz put Haworth in touch with a TV producer called Peter Scott and together they set up what was first called the Council for Mind Abuse, and which later metamorphosed into the Cult Information Centre in 1987, now run as a charity.I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults. That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thingHaworth and Scott concentrated on the group he had been involved with, even handing out flyers to a party of new recruits flown into Canada, exhorting them to go back to the airport. Faced with Haworth’s evidence, many of them did. Eventually, the resistance proved too much for the group. “Toronto wasn’t big enough for the both of us,” he smiles. “They got out.”Haworth doesn’t know where they are now, or if they still exist. Cults change their names often, to keep one step ahead of the media or inquisitive minds, and to muddy the paper trail they leave behind. Besides, he soon had more than enough on his plate as more and more people began to get in touch, especially after he had relocated back to the UK.One of the Cult Information Centre’s primary roles is working with ex-cult members. He likens the trauma that recovering cult followers go through to PTSD, and says systems to deal with and help them are variable, if present at all.He would also like to see stronger laws to deal with cults there’s no specific legislation surrounding them, and it’s only when cult leaders are discovered to have committed actual crimes, such as Aravindan Balakrishnan in 2015, that the law can act.Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh surrounded by devotees (Netflix)The Aravindan Balakrishnan case, and the revelations of Katy Morgan-Davies in her new book, add an extra dimension to Haworth’s work. It’s one thing to try to help cult members who have managed to break free return to their old, pre-cult lives, but what of those born into cults?“If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had,” says Haworth. “You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situation.”And don’t think it is only stupid people who would fall for a cult. Experts say that cults are most likely to be attractive to intelligent, well-educated people… they have flexible minds can consider and be seduced by the alternative lifestyles offered by cults.Documentary about alleged sex cult NXIVM being producedSmallville actor allegedly tried to recruit Emma Watson to ‘sex cult’Waco: what really happened when David Koresh’s cult faced the FBI?From Jonestown in the Seventies to Rajneeshpuram in the 1980s to Brixton in the 2000s: cults endure, and spring up all across the world. Nothing about modern life and its complexities has inured us against the attractions of a charismatic guru or cult leader.“They start off wanting the usual things,” says Haworth. “Money, sex, power over people. Then, after perhaps about 10 years, they start to believe the things they say, they maybe start to believe they are gods.”And as long as the false gods continue to prey on the innocent, Ian Haworth will continue his 40-years-and-counting battle against the scourge of the cults.For more information on Haworth’s work at the Cult Information Centre go to cultinformation.org.ukor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Serendipitously, at the start of this bicentennial year, I found myself invited to a wedding in what used to be called Karl-Marx-Stadt, since renamed Chemnitz, in the former East Germany. Communism may have formally collapsed with the downfall of the Soviet Union, yet it has not been extinguished.The world’s most populous state and rising superpower, China, is officially communist, albeit nominally. And socialist ideas remain prevalent throughout the world. The resurgence of socialism could be seen in the Chavismo new left wave of Latin American politics (admittedly now in the process of being rolled back). In the US, self-proclaimed socialist senator Bernie Sanders could well have been as unlikely an occupant of the Oval office as Donald Trump – if the Democratic National Committee had not conspired against him.In the UK, unapologetic socialist Jeremy Corbyn  swept to the leadership of Her Majesty’s opposition, appointed Trotskyist John McDonnell as shadow chancellor (McDonnell recently told the Financial Times that their aims for Britain are socialist), pronounced socialism as no longer a dirty word to a delirious conference, before garnering 40 per cent of the vote in the general election. In France, Jean Luc Mélenchon performed respectably in the first round of the French elections, commanding nearly 20 per cent of the vote. In Greece, the left-wing Syriza government remains in power – even though its manifesto has been crushed by international finance capital. Its former finance minister and firebrand Yanis Varoufakis describes himself as a lapsed Marxist. His recent essay penned in  cites Marx’s analysis as both the key to understanding our present predicament and the way out of it.John McDonnell says he won\u0027t be a Marxist ChancellorIn 2015, socialism was the most searched word on Merriam Webster’s online dictionary. Socialism does not carry historical baggage for a younger generation left behind by the iniquities of capitalism. A Harvard study found that a majority of millennials reject capitalism and a third are in favour of socialism. This is what might be called the revenge of Marx the rehabilitation of one of the world’s historical philosophers. Marx inverted Hegelian doctrine into dialectical materialism, affirming that it was material relations that were responsible for consciousness and social relations  –  not the other way round. In 2011, back when it was still unfashionable to confess to being Marxist, Oxford University literary theorist Professor Terry Eagleton boldly decreed that the bearded prophet had been right after all. Eagleton is no longer alone.A slew of books herald the end of capitalism, in the words of economic sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, and announce that we are entering the epoch of Postcapitalism, according to the gospel of journalist and author Paul Mason. The most dangerous philosopher in the West, Slavoj Zizek,  according to The New Republic magazine ,  is communist one of his recent tomes, Living in the End Times, conjures up the apocalyptic sense of the death throes of capitalism.Of course, it wasn’t meant to be like this. Marx’s ideas had apparently been discredited with the collapse of communism and consigned to Trotsky’s dustbin of history. Hadn’t history proven that communism was not a historical inevitability? Then came the 2008 financial crash and the demise of political economist Francis Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’. A decade of austerity was the death knell for the ideological vacuum. The fall-out has seen a polarisation between authoritarian nationalism and progressivism between dystopia and NOT dystopia, if you like.Neoliberalism​  always presented itself as depoliticised, in that the free market is akin to an all-enveloping atmosphere and as irresistible as a force of nature. Its allocation of resources and outcomes supposedly only required mere supervision through technocratic managerialism. In reality, it could not have been more ideological, operating through the corporate capture of the state and hollowing out of the institutions of civic society. Global capitalism appeared to be indomitable and impregnable, in so far as it was the hegemonic system. Yet at the same time, the delayed reaction of a series of political earthquakes, in the form of the Arab Spring and a wave of authoritarian populism, has exposed its vulnerabilities. Even if these events have not challenged the fundamental basis of the system, its neoliberal globalisation variant is under attack.Yanis Varoufakis was at the forefront of Greece’s radical left coalition (Getty)Mao Zedong’s description of capitalism as a paper tiger seems as pertinent as ever. Marxism bequeathed a rich legacy of thinkers, ranging from Lenin and Trotsky to the Frankfurt school, as well as the likes of Antonio Gramsci, Fredric Jameson and Alain Badiou. It was once unthinkable to break with Marxist orthodoxy on the left. Until, as American Marxist Marshall Berman relates in his modern classic All that is Solid Melts into Air (taking its cue from the famous phrase in the Communist Manifesto), a group of disaffected French post-structuralists and postmodernists, namely Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes, did just that. Disillusioned by the defeat of May 1968, when an uprising against De Gaulle resulted in his party emerging even stronger than before, they broke ranks.Raoul Peck: I Am Not Your Negro director on his film about Karl MarxPub where Marx and Engels discussed communist theory shuts downKarl Marx is \u0027back in fashion,\u0027 says shadow chancellor John McDonnellIs Jeremy Corbyn, in the words of his favourite philosopher Karl Marx,\u0027We can learn a great deal from Marx\u0027, says Jeremy CorbynIn the intervening decades, the battles of identity politics have been significant but they have also been hampered by the lack of a structural, systemic understanding of how capitalism operates. Where resistance has mirrored the fragmented, atomised, hyper-inidualism of neoliberalism then it has often been doomed to failure. All of which is very much bound up with the Cold War victory of the US empire. The CIA saw its chance, according to a recently declassified research paper. The agency read French postmodern theory, concluding that its questioning of the objective basis of reality could be used to undermine the Marxist doctrine of historical and teleological inevitability. Millions of dollars were pumped into front organisations such as magazines, publishing houses and favoured academics, in order to push postmodern ideas and to create a centre left, thus demarcating the outer boundary of respectable ideas – anything beyond which could be denounced as dangerous and radical lunacy. After all, the strategy of ide and rule has generally been the preferred one of the ruling class.Karl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesKarl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesGerman social, political and economic theorist Karl Marx.

The statues, created by artist Ottmar Hoerl, are part of an exhibition at the Museum Simeonstift Trier that were created to commemorate the 130th anniversary of the death of Marx in 1883. Marx, who was born in Trier, is the author of The Communist Manifesto, and his ideas on the relationship between labour, industry and capital created the ideological foundation for socialist and communist movements across the globe. Marx was familiar with the methods of the ruling class. He was often on the run from European authorities, eventually finding refuge in the relative tolerance of London where he ided up his time between his smoke-filled home (Soho then later Kentish town), the British Library and watering holes. His rebellious life  –  immersed in the struggles of the 19th century, from the 1848 revolutions to the Paris commune  –  lent itself, naturally, to the counterculture of the late 20th century. And now to the glamour of the big screen. A new Marx biopic – The Young Karl Marx   from I Am Not Your Negro director Raoul Peck  –  has been released. Marx’s starting point, outlined in his 1844 letter For A Ruthless Criticism of Everything Existing to fellow philosopher Arnold Ruge, is a philosophical tabula rasa comparable to a Cartesian wiping of the slate clean. This position of ‘Kritik’, adopted by the young Hegelians, gradually evolved into praxis for Marx. Hence, in Theses on Feuerbach (1888), Marx states “the philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point, however, is to change it”.The Communist Manifesto itself was not merely a political and economic tract. It is a call to arms, as well as a work of canonical sublimity and literary fecundity by turns poetic, inspired and visionary. Author and journalist Francis Wheen’s biography describes the Damascene moment at which Marx anoints the word ‘proletariat’. It descends on to the page like a thunderclap across the landscape, presaging the revolutions to come of the 20th century. In the wide-ranging debate Die Judenfrage, or The Jewish Question, Marx posits that the liberal definition of freedom is limited. The motto of ‘Liberté, Egalité, Fratérnité’ of the French revolution is just that  –  a good slogan. To take one example, equality does not relate to power or wealth but merely denotes equality before the law.Marx formulates that consciousness is generated by the mode of production, in a classic inversion of the Hegelian system. He defined alienation as the quintessential state of mind and being under capitalism, corresponding to the economic relations of commodification, exploitation and oppression. It is a state of mind that is little understood by the billions who experience it daily. Thus, bourgeois society is predicated on economic inidualism, private ownership and self-interest. The relations between iniduals, including intimate relations, are thus egoistical. Pure self-interest becomes the prime driver of not just economic processes but all relations. Under capitalism, every entity, no matter how sacred, can be transformed, exploited and sold for profit. This is what Marx meant by the intrinsic process of commodification. And it is this limitless commodification which extends into every sphere, including sex, the body and relationships.Lenin (left) and Trotsky were two of the 20th century’s greatest revolutionaries inspired by Marxism (Getty)Online pornography, social media  and dating apps are merely the latest extrapolations of this relentless commodification. Furthermore, social roles and relations are engendered by historical modes of production. Thus, the agrarian, feudal world corresponds to the social strata of monarchy aristocracy and the church dominating and exploiting the peasantry. Similarly, the industrial, urbanised world corresponds to the social structure of the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat. In a memorably thunderous passage in The Communist Manifesto, Marx extrapolates this connection between social and economic relations to define free trade: “It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom  –  Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.”Marx outlined the history of mankind as the history of class struggle in which the classes are opposed in a dialectical paradigm. Thus, we move from antiquity with the duality of slave owner and slaves to the feudal age of lord and serf to the capitalist age of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is these same unsustainable contradictions that Marx later proposes will bury capitalism, when the burgeoning proletariat become the ‘gravediggers’ of the bourgeoisie. This ‘final’ stage will usher in communism, completely transforming and reconfiguring the previous relations into a classless society. Marx outlines that communism, in abolishing private property, also abolishes alienation and wage bondage, leading to worker emancipation and, by extension, universal emancipation. Nevertheless, Marx subscribes to the enlightenment belief in the rationality and logic of mankind to create a narrative of progress. The bourgeois capitalist system is perceived as a necessary step in this progression, enabling the transition from a feudal, agrarian society into an urban, industrialised one. Thus, the bourgeoisie is portrayed as having played a revolutionary role in transforming the world. In its propensity for upheaval and turmoil, capitalism never ceases to alter the world.A monument to Karl Marx in the German city Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt (Getty)The dialectical materialist analysis of the history of class struggle played out in the contradictions of Marx’s own life. Whether in his marriage to the aristocratic Jenny Von Westphalen, or his friendship with industrialist Friedrich Engels, which enabled the genius of Marx and offset the penury of his journalism and political activities. Some of the most switched-on uber capitalists and masters of the universe concede that Marx’s basic analysis of capitalism has never been improved upon. Trump billionaire backer and donor Peter Thiel states that the breakdown of the status quo points either towards libertarianism or Marxism. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett  infamously once said: “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”The Marxist critique of capitalism hinges on its innate tendency towards concentration and centralisation of wealth. In Capital Volume 1, Marx fleshes out the M-C-M circuit (in which M is money and C is commodities). This circuit guarantees the expansion of capital, providing the economic basis of capitalism as a mechanism for limitless capital accumulation. The resulting crises of overproduction and capital accumulation are resolved through the enforced destruction of productive forces, the conquest of new markets and more thorough exploitation paving the way for more extensive and destructive crises. Fracking might be viewed as the ultimate metaphor for this process, whilst Uber is emblematic of the same hyper-exploitation.French economist Thomas Piketty’s work, updating the original title to Capital in the Twenty-First Century, using a large amount of historical data, has further corroborated Marx’s theories on the concentration of wealth. Unsurprisingly, several decades of neoliberalism have been the greatest testament to how a deregulated capitalism, red in tooth and claw, siphons wealth to the top 1 per cent or even 0.1 per cent. Recent figures show that the wealthiest eight billionaires in the world (whom you could fit into a people carrier) have as much wealth as the bottom half of the global population, or some 3. 5 billion people. Astonishingly, the equivalent figure was the 62 wealthiest billionaires in 2016. Back in 2010 it was more than 300. This is how rapidly wealth is being sucked up to the top  – this may be termed the vacuum-up effect as opposed to the myth of trickle-down economics.Stefan Konarske, left, as Friedrich Engels and August Diehl as Karl Marx in ‘The Young Karl Marx’ (Rex)Whilst Victorian capitalism was dominated by small-to-medium-sized companies, the middle decades of the 20th century witnessed a shift to statist capitalism. In effect, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China  represented variations on this theme. Since then the age of globalisation has been ushered in with multinational corporations straddling the globe – many of them larger than the states they operate in. The movement of vast pools of capital on a global scale is historically unmatched. Mega mergers seem to be rarely out of the headlines. In other words, the centralisation Marx predicted 150 years ago is panning out.There is a one-way trend towards the control of capital by an ever smaller number of players. Neoliberal doctrine emphasises the virtues of competition. Yet the reality of deregulated free markets, most evidently in financial services, has been monopoly, cartels, collusion and rigging. This is evidenced by the big four dominance in every sector from banking, accountancy, magic circle law firms, to high street supermarkets, energy companies and privatised utilities. The contradictions of the system have now attained a new level of absurdity.Capitalists presently invest in existing money, be it financial instruments, housing or debt, in order to make profit. In fact, this financialisation of the economy has superseded the traditional profit-making processes of manufacturing. Unlike manufacturing, this financialisation does not create value. Instead it creates asset bubbles of financial and housing speculation, which eventually burst, as happened on a seismic scale in the 2008 crash. Since the 1970s there have been a series of escalating market crises  – yet even this volatility is profitable for hedge funds.Civil unrest in France in 1968 was described as a social revolution against capitialism (Getty)So if late capitalism is economically, socially and ecologically unsustainable, not to mention bankrupt, then whither to from here? One of the obtuse criticisms of Marx has been the lack of a blueprint, despite the fact that a participatory, truly democratic society would need to emerge organically rather than following a roadmap. Marx posited revolution as “the driving force of history”. The overthrow of the existing state and the dissolution of property would lead to liberation extending to the dissolution of the bourgeois conceptions of family, marriage and all nation states. This liberation from national barriers would then bring everyone into connection with the production of the whole world for the pleasure of their consumption.Under communism, Marx daintily describes how one would be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner (naturally). Communism would appear to truly represent the end of the history, or at least the end of history, as class struggle :  “Communism is the riddle of history solved and it knows itself to be this solution.” Marx formulates that human emancipation can only be achieved by going beyond the bourgeois framework material emancipation translates into spiritual and sensuous emancipation. Only the resolution of the material modes of production, beyond the paradigm of economic inidualism, private property and self-interest, can liberate consciousness and revolutionise social relations  –  such that there is the capacity, the capability and propensity for free behaviour and genuine ties between iniduals based on love, warmth and affection, rather than purely calculating and cold self-interest.The exultant victory lap of all-singing, all-dancing capitalism has been remarkably brief the unipolar moment of American triumphalism short-lived. Only recently, US defence secretary Jim Mattis  announced that the era of great power politics has returned. Undoubtedly, a set of progressive ideas is coalescing amongst the new left  –  a green economy, public and democratic control of the economy, full automation. This 21st century manifesto is embodied in such books as Inventing the Future. The critical question remains of the vehicle necessary to bring about this transition.There is no doubt that 21st-century global capitalism is far more sophisticated and resilient than that of pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russia. The transition of capitalism to an alternative political and economic system will likely play out over a protracted period, even if it is catalysed by revolution. Much in the same way that feudalism evolved into capitalism through the dual industrial (economic) and French revolutions (political), in which the bourgeoisie superseded the aristocratic order preceded by the 17th-century English civil war.Or to leave the last word to Marx: “No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.”Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

Scientists want to test how “heavier-than-air vehicles” will operate on the red planet, Nasa said in a release. “The idea of a helicopter flying the skies of another planet is thrilling. The Mars Helicopter holds much promise for our future science, discovery, and exploration missions to Mars.” Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine said about the drone-like machine. What fake Mars colony Biosphere 2 looks like today “After the Wright Brothers proved 117 years ago that powered, sustained, and controlled flight was possible here on Earth, another group of American pioneers may prove the same can be done on another world,” Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said at the agency headquarters in Washington.The Mars Helicopter will not be manned but operated autonomously similar to how a drone is here on Earth. It has the potential to be much faster - and more complicated to pull off - than traveling the rocky and dirt-covered surface of Mars. However, unlike a drone “we don’t have a pilot and Earth will be several light minutes away, so there is no way to joystick this mission in real time,” MiMi Aung, the Mars Helicopter Project Manager at the agency’s Jet Propulsion Lab said. Instead, the helicopter will be able to receive a set of commands for flying a mission and carry them out on its own, Ms Aung explained. Nasa\u0027s canny decision to commission sumptuous vintage-inspired posters by Seattle design firm Invisible Creature has firmly placed space travel back where it belongs: in the imagination of travellersIt is particularly fitting that the Nasa commission went to Don and Ryan Clark, who have been running Invisible Creature since 2006, undertaking projects for the likes of Nike and TargetWe were ecstatic, just because our grandfather was an illustrator at Nasa for 30 years, says ClarkThe artwork harks back to the Jet Age-era posters commissioned by Howard Hughes\u0027 Trans World Airlines and its rival United in the 1950s and 1960s, when the work of David Klein (for TWA) and Stan Galli (for United) glamorised and essentially branded this new age of air travelIt doesn\u0027t matter that Nasa has no plans for a Grand Tour of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and UranusIf global travel is for daydreamers, going beyond the atmosphere is for true space cadetsOne of the main challenges is that helicopters here on Earth have only reached an altitude of 40,000 feet (12,192 meters), but Mars’ atmosphere is one per cent that of Earth’s. That means the new helicopter is on the surface of the planet, it will already be the equivalent of 100,000 feet up in the Earth’s atmosphere. “To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be,” Ms Aung said. Nasa lander to dig into the Mars surface to answer deepest mysteriesNasa and ESA to bring soil from Mars to try and find aliensMission to Mars will launch within a decade, says SpaceX president“NASA has a proud history of firsts,” Mr Bridenstine said. According to Nasa, “the full 30-day flight test campaign will include up to five flights of incrementally farther flight distances, up to a few hundred meters, and longer durations as long as 90 seconds, over a period. On its first flight, the helicopter will make a short vertical climb to 10 feet (3 meters), where it will hover for about 30 seconds”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Fishing accounts for 41 per cent of the islands’ and two thirds of the corporation tax received by its treasury. UK threatens less EU security cooperation if locked out of GalileoAny negative impact from Brexit on the islands’ economy is likely to be a thorny issue for Brexiteers, for many of whom the Falklands is a touchstone issue.Speaking after recent trips to Brussels and London the chair of the islands’ eight-person legislative assembly told The Independent that potential disruption caused by exit from the single market “would put at risk the current profitability of our fishing industry and would impact both the wider economy and government revenue”.The Falkland Islands Government also says “any material change that results in less beneficial importexport access could be potentially catastrophic for the Falkland Islands economy and people”, according to a report drawn up by the UK Overseas Territories Association.The British government says it has “prioritised securing the freest and most frictionless trade possible with the EU”, although in fact it has pledged to leave the single market and customs union.Any material change that results in less beneficial importexport access could be potentially catastrophic for the Falkland Islands economyThe islands mostly export loligo squid to Spain, a seafood that accounts for 89 per cent of their exports to the EU. The Falklands provided over a third of the loligo squid imported by Spain last year once it arrives in the port of Vigo it enters the EU supply chain and is distributed around the world.Representatives of the islands’ fishing industry believe that the “worst case scenario” of having to trade on World Trade Organisation rules as advocated by some Brexiteers would cause a £9m hit to revenues because of tariffs – a large sum for the 3,400-population archipelago that would amount to over £2,600 per person.The islands’ fishing association says cultivating other markets for squid would be “difficult”, especially in Asia, where “demand is highest but competition is strong, and both political and tariff barriers exist”. In the event of a “no deal” Brexit the islanders say they would be left with no choice but to seek support from the British state to prop up their fishing industry.Theresa May has pledged to leave the single market, stating that remaining in it would be incompatible with properly leaving the EU. The British government hopes to secure tariff- and quota-free access to EU markets for fish and seafood through a free trade agreement – but Seafish, a non-departmental public body that supports the British fishing industry, says Brexit has caused “considerable levels of uncertainty” for the sector.While not technically a member of the single market the Falkland Islands currently enjoys preferential access as a result of its status as a self-governing UK overseas territory and Britain’s membership. It pays no tariffs and is exempt from quotas.Teslyn Barkman, one of the eight elected members of the Falkland Islands government’s Legislative Assembly told The Independent: “We have worked hard over many years to establish and grow our fishing industry – it really is a Falkland Islands success story, and one that has allowed us to stand on our own two feet financially.“As a result of our current tariff- and quota-free access to the EU single market, our fishing companies have been able to develop strong markets across Europe for our premium loligo squid, which is our primary export.  Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Don’t stop on the side of the road,” Doug Bos, the owner of the zoo, told CBC News in January, when the footage was shared. “If everybody would listen to the video, that’s what the message was – don’t do this.”Where not to visit if you love animalsWhere not to visit if you love animalsChimpanzees are forced to perform demeaning tricks on leashes and are often subject to cruel training techniques. Animals who are confined to small, barren enclosures and forced to perform unsurprisingly show symptoms of stress and depression. Chimpanzees have been documented rocking back and forth, sucking their lips, salivating and swaying against enclosure perimeters in distress.Some marine parks use bottlenose dolphins in performances and offer visitors the opportunity to swim with dolphins. Unfortunately, people are often unaware that these animals are captured in the wild and torn from their families or traded between different parks around the world.Tigers are forced to live in an unnatural and barren environment and have to endure interactions with a constant stream of tourists. Since tigers never lose their wild instincts, across the world they are reportedly drugged, mutilated and restrained in order to make them “safe” for the public. However, every year, incidents of tiger maulings are reported at this type of tourist attraction.Sunning on the beach is great for humans – we can take a quick dip or catch a bite to eat when we get too hot or hungry. But it\u0027s pure hell for donkeys who are confined to the beach and forced to cart children around on the hot sand. Some donkey-ride operators at beach resorts in the UK even keep the animals chained together at all times. Some parks confine orcas to concrete tanks and force them to perform meaningless tricks for food - many die in captivity. Orcas are highly intelligent and social mammals who may suffer immensely, both physically and mentally, when they\u0027re held in captivity.Lions are confined to fenced areas so that they can easily be cornered, with no chance of escape. Most of them will have been bred in captivity and then taken from their mothers to be hand-reared by the cub-petting industry. When they get too big, they may be drugged before they are released into a hunting enclosure. Because these animals are usually kept in fenced enclosures (ranging in size from just a few square yards to thousands of acres), they never stand a chance of surviving.Every year, tourists travel to Pamplona for the Running of the Bulls. The bulls who are forced to slip and slide down the town\u0027s narrow cobblestone streets are chased straight into the bullring. They are then taunted, stabbed repeatedly and finally killed by the matador in front of a jeering crowd. The majority of Spaniards reject bullfighting, but tourists are keeping the cruel industry on its last legs. City streets are no place for horses. The animals toil in all weather extremes, suffering from respiratory distress from breathing in exhaust fumes as well as numerous hoof, leg and back problems from walking on pavement all day long. As easily spooked prey animals, horses subjected to the loud noises and unexpected sounds of city streets are likely to be involved in accidents, even deadly ones. The zoo community regards the animals it keeps as commodities, and animals are regularly bought, sold, borrowed and traded without any regard for established relationships. Zoos breed animals because the presence of babies draws visitors and boosts revenue, yet often, there\u0027s nowhere to put the offspring as they grow, and they are killed, as we recently saw with Marius the giraffe in Denmark. Some zoos have introduced evening events with loud music and alcohol which disrupt the incarcerated animals even further. At the time, a trainer said there were no safety concerns, as the bear was secured by a chain and the film had been taken before the Dairy Queen had opened for the day. Football team condemned after muzzled bear forced to deliver ballMan ‘trying to take selfie’ with bear is mauled to deathFirst polar bear bred in Singapore dies after five-year health battlePark staff accidentally kill one of world’s rarest bearsFemale bears evolve to hunting threat by raising cubs for longerThe zoo, located in Innisfail, Alberta, has now been charged under the Wildlife Act for taking the bear out without informing the authorities – one count relates to the ice cream excursion and the other for failing to inform officials the bear was being taken home nightly for bottle-feeding in 2017.The owners of the wildlife park, Mr Bos and Debbie Rowland, have said they plan to plead guilty. “We made a mistake. I’m embarrassed about it,” Mr Bos told . “Every time we take an animal off the property, we’re supposed to notify Fish and Wildlife, send them an email, and we forgot to do that in both instances.”The zoo’s permit has also been revised to include new conditions requiring the zoo to provide more details when transporting animals and to keep them in a cage, crate or kennel while in a vehicle.Members of the public will also be barred from having any contact with animals, including bears. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Scottish Power is increasing prices by 5.5 per cent - \u0026pound63 on average, while EDF will see 1.2 million pay \u0026pound16 more on average.Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: Npower already has the most expensive standard tariff available and has come bottom in our satisfaction survey for the eighth year in a row.This further price increase will leave customers questioning why they\u0027re paying even more for their gas and electricity.Npower\u0027s customers looking to avoid the price rise should look to switch immediately, as they could be saving up to \u0026pound433 a year.Npower\u0027s domestic markets managing director, Simon Stacey, said: While existing customers who are currently on a fixed deal, have a prepayment meter or on the Safeguard tariff are protected from these increases, we encourage any customer who is struggling with their energy bills to contact us."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/brexit-vote-leave-council-ban-traders-freedom-of-speech-Oswestry-958711.jpg","title":"brexit vote leave council ban traders freedom of speech Oswestry market Shropshire harper","story":"Brexit supporters had to leave their market stall as they refused to get rid of a Vote Leave posterGraham and Margaret Harper were furious when they were told by the market manager in Oswestry, Shropshire, that they had to remove their poster because it was \u0026ldquopolitical.The Harpers, who have been selling plants and vegetables for decades, took their incredulity to the town hall - but didn\u0026rsquot receive the help they hoped for.Local councillors held a closed door meeting and ruled the couple had to remove the Vote Leave sign or leave the Oswestry Market.The town council clerk said in a letter to the Harpers that the sign breached the policy that \u0026ldquono political publicity be displayed on any market stalls as this would be considered a breach of licence conditions.Mr Harper, 78, and his wife, 76, believe the move was an attack on free speech and took their business away.\u0026nbsp                Brexit is a catastrophe!

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His company sold 1,000 in the first three hours.Musk is also known as a visionary, with plans to start a self-sustaining colony of a million people living in glass domes on the surface of Mars.But he has also said he fears a global artificial intelligence arms race could spark World War 3 and warned humanity must act now to stop killer robots wiping us out.He has admitted he is bipolar and revealed the great highs and terrible lows of his life in a series of candid tweets.On January 13, Musk claimed he ended up at a drug-fuelled sex party only because he thought it was a fancy dress do.Women allegedly had MDMA and took part in a cuddle puddle at the bash at the Silicon Valley home of venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson.Business Insider published a statement from Musk which read: I dont want this to be anti-climactic, but I didnt see any sex or drugs.“I went home at 12.30 a.m., and I guess sex parties dont really kick off until the boring f**kers go home. I didnt exactly know it was a sex party, and I got bored at some point and went home.”SpaceX is an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company.It was founded in 2002 by Musk with the goal of colonising Mars.It was the first privately funded company to successfully launch, orbit and recover a spacecraft.Now it has laid out details to the US government about its plans for a 4,425-strong satellite network in space.It is one of several companies aiming to deploy satellite-based internet services over the next few years.Tesla is an American car and energy company co-founded by Musk.It produced the first electric sports car in 2008.As of September 2016, 164,000 electric cars have been sold worldwide since the delivery of its first Tesla Roadster in 2008.Hyperloop is a high-speed transportation system where pressurised capsules ride on an air cushion driven by motors and air compressors.A route was outlined where this could be built - between the Greater Los Angeles area and San Fransisco Bay area.A deal has already been struck for the firm to set up a system to connect Abu Dhabi with Dubai.Britain may be the first in Europe to get the 500mph Hyperloop One train, as UK cities are bidding for the opportunity to trial the technology.In August 2017 Musk revealed jaw-dropping footage of a test pod travelling at 200mph.SpaceX launched Falcon Heavy from Kennedy Space Centre in Florida on February 6, 2018, at around 3:45 pm ET (8:45 pm UK time) after being delayed.Ultimately it was delayed by two hours because of the weather but luckily they proceeded with the launch.The demonstration flight to the Mars orbit is set to pave the way for a human trip to the planet in years to come.SpaceXs Falcon 9 rocket makes its first successful upright landing on the Of Course I Still Love You droneship on April 8, 2016Elon Musk posted a video on his Instagram page, writing: First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done!Pending final regulatory approvals, we will be offering free rides to the public in a few months.He intends to give priority to pods for pedestrians and cyclists for less than the cost of a bus ticket.The exact location  and distance of the tunnel shown in the video was not clear but a report in the LA Times thought it was taking place in the Hawthorne area.Musk received permission last year to drill a 2-mile test-tunnel beneath Crenshaw Boulevard and 120th street.The City Councils public works committee last month unanimously approved an environmental review exemption for a tunnel that could run 2.7 miles through West Los Angeles, giving a space for Boring Co. engineers to build and test the proposed transportation technology.His net worth is said to be around £10billion, as of January 2017.He made his money through the sales of the companies he founded and co-founded.His first company was Zip2 which he created with his brother, Kimbal, in 1995 with start up capital of $28,000 from his dad.As well as overseeing his high-profile tech projects, Musk has been married twice.He had six sons with his first wife, Justine Wilson, before the pair separated in 2008 after eight years.Musk married English actress Talulah Riley in 2010, remarried her in in 2013 after the pair briefly divorced in 2012, and then finally divorced for a second time in October 2016.Actress Amber Heard, who divorced from Johnny Depp after a long-running and controversial separation, has been in an on-off relationship with Musk.At the start of February, it was reported that the pair had split for a second time because the timing wasnt right.Musk is now thought to be dating musician Grimes, aka Claire Boucher, with the couple making their debut at the Met Gala earlier this week. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Shame on them.More MPs backed away from Tom Watson’s sinister “Section 40” bid to force papers into the death grip of Max Mosley’s Press-hating Impress crew.Watson’s sole aim was revenge against papers critical of Labour. He finally bottled out of a vote he knew he would lose. A malevolent conspiracy theorist, bully and liar . . . now a coward to boot.But the Labour lardbucket ­will not give up. Nor will his orgy-loving benefactor Mosley, nor Miliband, nor Hacked Off Hugh nor their weird, obsessive acolytes.The Tories will have to defend Press freedom again. They can begin by repealing Section 40, as their manifesto pledged.THE Lords’ latest sickening insult to democracy has surely hammered the final nail in the unelected chamber’s coffin.Their vote to stay in the single market is beyond belief in its stupidity, arrogance and insane ­willingness to expose the country to dangerous instability.It would mean surrendering control over immigration for ever — and never actually “leaving” the EU.The Lords’ role is to tweak and advise on laws, not impose entirely contrary policies because they don’t like how the country votes. They are telling 17.4million people: “You don’t count. We do.”How do they imagine Leavers would react if the biggest vote in our history was negated by unelected, ermine-clad party stooges, some on EU pensions?We genuinely fear the consequences.It was the Lords, too, who began the attempt to muzzle the Press. They are rotting our democracy from within.IT is appalling that the Government is ­considering a new witch-hunt into Army veterans of the Troubles.The vast majority of unsolved murders were by terrorists, mostly since given immunity by the Labour Government.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has been advised she cannot legally exclude veterans.

There was a really big social expectation to have the best things and it was affecting school life for a lot of people.There was groups created around who had the best things but I think that has been taken away. Thats not an issue anymore.The charity also said conversations about what we did at the weekend can penalise those from low-income backgrounds.Its chief executive Jeremy Cripps said: The government is constantly saying that the way out of poverty is educational achievement and by that they mean doing well in school exams and ideally going on to further education.But if youre not engaging with it to start with you really havent got a chance to take advantage of all that education."},{"url":null,"title":"cruel onlookers cheered and laughed as distraught man jumped 30ft from asda rooftop","story":"He plunged to the ground and eyewitnesses reported seeing him holding a knife while he shouted from the roof.People outside the store in Bexleyheath, South East London, said the man’s father was seen desperately trying to talk him down.Staff at the supermarket said he climbed up to the top of roof and was distraught following the death of his child.The man was in a stand off with police for more than an hour and is now being treated for severe injuries in hospital.One Asda worker said: He was really determined because its not easy to get up there.He climbed onto a net that we use to keep pigeons away and almost fell through it then.I didnt understand what was happening.

A backbench bill by Labour MP Peter Kyle to give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote in elections and referendums was talked out by Tory MPs in a government-backed plot to avoid defeat.SNP chief whip Patrick Grady branded the move “corrupt and unfair” after Mr Kyle was given just 30 minutes to debate his motion.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There’s so many questions I don’t know the answer to about why we never went on a second date.“But I’m blaming it on the garlic noodles.To this day that’s like an ongoing joke — don’t order the ­garlic noodles that ruined my ­chances!”He made up for it by going on to bed socialite Paris Hilton, whose One Night In Paris sex tape was leaked online.Paris and Simon had an intense three-month relationship and saw each other on and off for four years. Their wild nights together were a world away from Simon’s date with “square” Meghan.Simon Rex, as rapper Dirt, says dates with Paris were a world away from square MeghanIn an exclusive chat from his home in LA, Simon, 43, said: “Meghan seemed well-raised and ­educated, she wasn’t a bad girl. She was kind of a square.“That’s probably why we didn’t hit it off, I’m a little more rough around the edges. When I asked her out again I just got the hint she wasn’t into me. I took it on the chin.”Meghan and Simon met in 2004 when they guest starred on Cuts, a long-forgotten US ­sitcom.Simon’s career was flying high after a role on hit comedy Scary Movie 3.He said: “Maybe that’s why she liked me — I remember her saying she thought it was really funny. It probably helps when you’re on the poster for a big movie and in all the commercials.”They were together for four days of rehearsals before shooting scenes in front of a live studio ­audience on a Friday night at Paramount studios in Hollywood.He said: “We were both new to the show and we were both nervous. You get to know someone pretty quick when you’re sitting round together all day on set.“She was sweet and very polite. She had kind eyes. You could tell she was a nice person.“She would laugh at my corny jokes. I remember flirting with her, cracking jokes and her laughing. My ego loved that, of course.“I don’t believe in love at first sight but I believe in lust at first sight and she was really attractive. She’s a beautiful girl.”By the last day of filming Simon decided he wanted a date and plucked up the courage to ask Meghan out.He said: “I worked up enough nerve to give her my number.“This is pre-smartphones and social media. It might be one of the last times I wrote my number on a napkin.”Meghan quickly got in touch and he asked her out for dinner.The pair went to the Woo Lae Oak, a Korean barbecue restaurant in Beverly Hills. Simon had chopsticks with his name on brought out because he was such a regular there. He ordered a beef dish and another of chicken.He said: “We had a great time. she wouldn’t drink, I had wine but she had water or Coke.“A lot of actresses tend to be divas but she was the opposite. She was sweet to the waiter.“She looked really beautiful. I was like, sign me up, man!”But one of the other dishes Simon ordered was garlic noodles — which proved to be a mistake after he drove her home.He recalls: “We were in the car and as I started kissing her it was obvious that I had garlic breath.“She pulled back. It was so embarrassing.“She said something like, ‘Oh boy, garlic’.“I just felt so dumb. We laughed about it. She wasn’t rude about it or anything. She was honest. She was turned off. It was an awkward moment.”Simon asked Meghan to go to a bar or a club with him after their meal but she declined.He said: “I remember her saying something like, ‘I’ve got to get up early’. She had to work the next day or something.”At the end of their date, crestfallen Simon jumped out of his black Cadillac and opened the door for Meghan to let her out.He hugged her and she went into her home.Simon texted Meghan a couple of days later but admits: “I didn’t get a second date.“I think she even said something along the lines of, ‘We could just be friends’, which was like a dagger to the heart.Meghan — who The Sun revealed used dating guide The Rules to fix her love life — stuck to one of the book’s principles with Simon — “no more than casual kissing on the first date”.Simon said with a laugh: “Looks like she stuck to her rule book. This is all news to me!”The Sun’s revelations about performer Simon’s past date with Meghan have caused a sensation — just a week before she is due to marry Prince Harry at Windsor Castle.A decade before their date Simon had performed a sex act on himself for a porn movie at age 18 after being persuaded to do it by an adult film actress he was dating.To pay his rent, he starred as mystery hunk “Sebastian” in three solo nude sex films which went straight to video. He said: “I never had sex with anybody on camera. It was just me standing there naked.“To me it doesn’t mean s*** but I could see why some people get their feathers ruffled about it, especially the Royal Family.”Simon has had a string of stunning exes including Jaime Pressly from TV’s My Name Is Earl and Twin Peaks’ actress Lara Flynn Boyle.He is also pals with Brit celebrities Calum Best and super producer Mark Ronson. It wasn’t long after his date with Meghan that he started seeing heiress Paris.The blonde reality TV star had shot to fame after footage of her having sex with US poker player Rick Salomon was leaked on the internet. Simon said: “I did a movie, Pledge This with Paris.“Me and Paris were casually dating but it was not like I couldn’t take a girl out on a date, we weren’t exclusive.“This was when she was at the top of her fame. It was like Kim Kardashian. You couldn’t just go to get a drink or dinner because she was swarmed.“It was non-stop. I don’t know how she does it.“It was out of control with Paris, totally exhausting.“It is ironic, as that’s now Meghan Markle’s world.”The comic and rapper — whose hip-hop alter-ego is Dirt Nasty — said he believes he would get on with Prince Harry and was impressed by his naked antics in Las Vegas.He said: “I like the dude — he’s the one royal I like. I swear me and him, under different circumstances, would have a beer and a laugh. I really think that.“You can tell Harry has a sense of humour. He might even be a Dirt Nasty fan, I know he’s in to hip-hop.”Speaking of the upcoming wedding, Simon, who is now in a new relationship, added: “I’ve got nothing but love for both of them.“She made the better move to go with him in the long run. I think she’ll be a great princess.“I hope they have a lot of babies and make America proud. Good on them.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

one of which is given some money.But while the person with the cash is obligated to share some of the loot with other player that portion can be as small as zero.And the Dutch scientists found that small men act more aggressively when there is no threat of repercussions, reports The New Scientist.Experts believe this proves that short man syndrome, also known as Napoleon Complex, is real and factors into the everyday lives of vertically-challenged males.In the study, the 42 volunteers were split into pairs and allowed to meet their partners – who were either little or large depending on their own stature.After allowing the tiny test subjects to see their physically dominant opponents, each player was given a separate room where they were asked to give up some cash.The shortest men in the study, measuring around 5ft7in kept 14 of their 18 tokens to themselves on average while the tall men, measuring about 6ft6in in height, only kept nine of their 18 credits.But when the small gents were faced with the threat of repercussion, they did not display aggressive behaviour and were more willing to share with their opponents.Lead researcher Jill Knapen said: “It’s probably smart for short men to be like this because they have less opportunities to get resources.Short blokes on average are less wealthy, less successful and less healthy than their taller counterparts, according to studies.Bigger men also enjoy better sex and love lives than small guys.Little men may also have to adopt a more defensive stance because of aggression from their larger peers.Mike Eslea at the University of Central Lancashire is sceptical about whether the type of behaviour displayed by small males can be explained by the Napoleon Complex.Speaking to New Scientist, he said: “They’re supposed to be publicly advertising their aggressiveness to compensate for their lack of stature.“To me this doesn’t suggest the Napoleon Complex exactly, it suggests something else.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000405240436.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"newlywed couple china honeymoon preston","story":"Legend Liang, 33 and his new wife Carmen, travelled 6,000 miles to spend their holiday not on a sandy beach under a palm tree but in the Lancashire city.He whisked Carmen from their home and spent three days in the town -

which is the tallest in Britain.But Legend was amazed at the difference a decade made - with the campus now including its Xbox building - a green, grey and black-coloured media centre.He added: The Media Factory was a building site so its nice to see that looking so good, Fylde Building has gone and theres others being built while in the city centre the market has changed so much.The pair spent the last two weeks also visiting London, Brighton and Edinburgh as they flew back home to their native China on Thursday.Legend, a Guangzhou Yangcheng Evening News reporter, said his wife had enjoyed her trip to Preston as much as him - proving the 14 hour flight was worth it.He said: She thought London was a huge city, just like we have back home but Preston was really nice because she could see how UK people live and work in a small city with everything they need being close by.Legend studied at Guangdong University of Foreign Study, an international partner of UCLan since 1986, for two years before his move to Preston.He was taught in his home country by Matt Horn - the course leader of the international journalism franchise programme since it began in 2005.Matt said: Legend always showed the natural instincts required of a good journalist and is well respected in the city.UCLan and GDUFS have a long and happy history together and so I was delighted when Legend introduced his bride to be as I had taught her for GDUFS a couple of years after I was Legends teacher.Preston is famous as the location for the opening of the first KFC in the UK in 1965 and as the home of Preston North End FC."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000395754020.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"rubbish fly tipped england stretch 1600 miles moscow","story":"The bill for taxpayers rocketed 13 per cent last year, councils said.They revealed that in 2016/17 there were 492,139 cases where waste the size of a small van or tipper truck was illegally dumped.Put together the vehicles would form a 1,459-mile queue, with the amount of fly-tipped rubbish circling the M25 12 times.

Scott might be 26 years her junior but he always strikes me as the “older” one in the relationship.It’s that sheer zest for life that Barbara has, even at 80, that makes this diagnosis so very sad and hard to bear.Scott decided to speak out because he felt he could no longer protect his beloved wife from people outside their close circle of friends and family hearing the truth.He became worried her illness would make her do or say something out of ­character that could upset her and others.He wants to be able to take his wife on ­ outings, and for her to still meet the public who love her and who will now ­hopefully understand if she’s having a “foggy” day.Scott also needs to make sure he takes care of himself and doesn’t get completely worn out looking after his wife.He hasn’t been able to leave her alone in the house recently, but now the truth is out he can let others take over while he at least has half an hour to himself.Anyone who cares for someone with dementia knows it is utterly exhausting, stressful and worrying, no matter how much you love them.I salute everyone who quietly and patiently deals with these day-to-day ­struggles. Scott is now free of the burden of keeping the secret and I hope he is finding strength from all of the messages of support for Barbara.She’s been part of many of our most-loved shows and we’ve grown up with “Our Babs”.I remember watching her wiggle and giggle her way through the Carry On films, where her sheer talent and perfect comic timing marked her out as a little superstar.Who could forget her enthusiastic arm flinging exercise routine in Carry On Camping that ended with her bra pinging off?And that incredible bikini made up of three shiny red hearts in Carry On Again Doctor made my pal Dr Hilary Jones decide to take up a career in medicine.As she more than proved during her reign in EastEnders, Barbara has always been so much more than a bubbly blonde dolly bird.She is one hell of an actress and was in her element behind the bar of The Queen Vic.It was her and Scott’s decision to kill off Peggy Mitchell when her memory began to fade.Barbara was having difficulty ­learning lines so felt she couldn’t give her very best performance.As it so happens, the scenes leading up to her character’s death were some of the best that ­Barbara, or any soap actress, has ever given on the small screen. Quite simply she is the real deal.I’ve been lucky enough to ­interview her many times over the years and it’s like catching up with an old friend.She’s open and honest and has never tried to cover up her ­mistakes or to sugar-coat the ups and downs of her life.When work was thin on the ground she painted on a smile, climbed into her shiny fairy godmother outfit and worked her backside off in provincial pantos.She was always quick to credit EastEnders for giving her a career comeback.I’ve seen her talking to fans outside the ­studio, always happy to pose for pictures, sign autographs and have a chat.She would leave everyone with a smile on their face and some happy memories.Her own powers of recall and her very bright light may be diminishing, but Scott and all her friends and family, and the public who adore her, will ensure she is wrapped in a soft blanket of love.She’s a class act and a very special woman.TAKE a bow Shayne Ward and all concerned with the deeply moving and hugely important storyline of Aidan’s suicide in Coronation Street.The subject was handled with great sensitivity.We saw Aidan feeling isolated and alone in the crowded Rovers, witnessed his fearful despair and heard his father’s anguished screams of grief through the closed bedroom door.There was no need to see his cold, dead body to understand what had happened. This really was Corrie at its finest.Richard Hawley as devastated dad Johnny and Catherine Tyldesley as poor bereaved Eva were exceptional, but what made me really blub was the authentic speech by Gail (Helen Worth) looking out of her window on to the iconic cobbled street, talking about how we all need to look after each other and that no one should suffer in silence.It was beautifully written and impeccably delivered.That’s what Corrie is all about.IT’S the one time of the year when our inevitable failure to win a massive trophy in Europe is a source of fun and amusement rather than humiliation. Because tonight is Eurovision.Our plucky Brit doomed to failure this time is SuRie, above, who is actually a good performer with a perfectly acceptable song, but even if the UK entry was Robbie Williams belting out Angels, we would still be near the bottom of the table or even doomed to the dreaded “nul points”.Many theories are put forward for our dire results over the past two decades.Some believe there are too many countries taking part (Australia and Israel are bizarrely considered part of Europe) which makes for more tactical voting, combined with an anti- British backlash made worse by Brexit.I reckon it’s simply because we don’t take it seriously enough, for which I’m very grateful, because I truly love Eurovision.We know we won’t win so it’s just an excuse for a party, a chance to wallow in the whole wonderful campfest and to chortle at Graham Norton’s snarky comments.My perfect evening.WHEN Kim Kardashian is the most elegant and tastefully dressed woman in the room, you know that something has gone horribly awry.So it was at the ludicrous Met Gala in New York, which saw a procession of show-offs dressing up like extras from the Monty Python sketch about the Spanish Inquisition.Madonna looked like Dracula’s mad old aunty, Sarah Jessica Parker had a nativity scene on her head, and don’t get me started on Rihanna, who came as some sort of sexy bishop mashed up with a pearly queen.It made Kim’s skin-tight gold sheath Versace dress appear to be the epitome of class.We are told the Pope approved this farrago, which was pompously entitled Heavenly Bodies: Fashion And The Catholic Imagination.His endorsement should make you shudder – until you realise that’s how he always dresses.He’s also a man with a passion for red leather Prada slip-ons, so I suppose he is more connected to the weird world of fashion than your average parish priest.A great deal of money is raised for good causes at this tacky celebration of fame and fortune, and that’s all well and good. But maybe next year they should stay at home and write a cheque.One thing is certain. You can be darned sure they won’t follow up the Catholic theme by making a mockery of Islam or Judaism.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Gods name, I was shocked. The children were scared it was a dead monster. Nobody knows what it is yet.Neighbouring residents gathered round the creepy corpse laying in shallow sea water on the beach in the town of San Antonio for a closer look at the animal.It is about 4ft wide at one end and about 2ft wide at the other with a greyish white colour. A similar globster appeared in Dinagat Islands, Philippines, last February which baffled officials.Government workers from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in the Mimapora region will now dispose of the creature later today.Fishery Law Enforcement Officer Vox Krusada said: Today we just gathered a samples of it for further analysis.For now we can say its a whale, but the exact species is still unknown. The tissue samples are now sent to our lab for DNA analysis.The local government of Gloria will now bury the carcass. And damn it smells awful. it smells like something from another planet.I really experienced the full power of its smell because Im the one who took the tissue samples. I almost puked.

The shocked OAP, unsure what to do with the pony, contacted World Horse Welfare who got in touch with the RSPCA.The animal charity today released pictures of the pony stranded in the small yard of the house surrounded by wheelie-bins, garden furniture and a rabbit hutch.RSPCA inspector Charlotte Melvin, who attended the property to check over the horse, said: You couldnt make this up.A 13-year-old girl responded to a plea on an online free ads site where a lady said she didnt want the pony anymore and that he would be put to sleep if no one had him.She gave her nans address and the next thing that happened was a man just came along and dumped the pony there, no words of advice or anything like that - and leaving a very shocked nan.We dont know where this poor pony came from but he clearly was not treated well before being abandoned.We have come to a dead end in trying to find out further information so we are appealing for anybody who can help us to get in touch.The pony, who has been named Mr Melvin Andrews, is now in the care of World Horse Welfare.Field officer Rachel Andrews who transported the animal to a private boarding establishment, said she hoped the incident was not the start of a new trend.She added: Were seeing sick or young ponies being dumped and abandoned when their owners no longer want them, and it would be a worry if online free ad sites are used in this way.Many provide advice on the commitment required to take on a horse.Every horse and pony deserves responsible ownership, which includes responsible breeding, selling and rehoming.Were just glad that Melvin the pony has settled in well at our Penny Farm Rescue and Rehoming Centre and has already shown himself to be lovely a little pony and we hope in time we can find him a good home.Anyone who has any information is asked to call the RSPCAs appeals line on 0300 123 8018 or World Horse Welfare at 08000 480 180.Last month, the RSPCA revealed that the number of horses rescued by the charity has reached a four-year high, as the equine crisis continues to have devastating consequences.The charitys annual Cruelty Statistics revealed that nearly 1,000 horses were rescued by the charity from cruelty, suffering and neglect last year (2017), and a staggering 928 horses are currently in the charitys care."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004034380181-e1525959399883.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"neil kinnock accuses labour leader of jeremy corbyn serious evasion of duty over brexit single market stance","story":"The former Labour leader, who led the party from 1983 to 1992, said Corbyns stance on the single market could lead to the rockslide of hard Brexit.He also said that arguments against the single market formed part of an infantile leftist illusion in an interview with The Independent.Mr Kinnock added: It would be a serious evasion of duty if Labour did not seize this chance to protect our country from the rockslide of hard Brexit.By supporting continued (European Economic Area) participation we can end the prime ministers deference to the cliff-edge kamikaze squad and force her, or her successor, into the pragmatic patriotism of putting country before party.He added: I respect our Labour leadership in the Lords and I value loyalty.

The world\u0026#8217s worst Ebola outbreak took the lives of 11,000 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia in 2014 after the virus spread from a young boy living in a village in rural Guinea. Poorly equipped and understaffed medical workers turned down infected patients and when the disease spread to the densely populated Liberian capital of Monrovia a health crisis turned into a catastrophe.In early 2016, the WHO said the outbreak had been contained and eliminated but 17,000 survivors were left traumatised and fearful of the future.Over the past few days, the DRC\u0026#8217s near-neighbours like Nigeria have taken steps to prevent the spread of the virus by introducing checks and health screening at its airports.Meanwhile, the Trump administration signalled its disinterest when it asked for ebola-related funding cuts of US$252 million, as part of a package aimed at reigning in government spending."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/Ut_HKthATH4eww8X4xMDoxOjA4MTsiGN_4307470.jpg?20180512105208 ","title":"nasa to send helicopter to mars","story":"Controllers on Earth will command the Mars Helicopter, which is designed to receive and interpret commands from the ground.\"The ability to see clearly what lies beyond the next hill is crucial for future explorers,\" said NASA\u0027s Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the science mission directorate.\"We already have great views of Mars from the surface as well as from orbit.

In Labour strongholds, you\u0027d be hard pressed to find any.But after the PM lost her Commons majority in last year\u0027s general election, she doesn\u0027t have the votes in the Commons for a widespread expansion of the grammar school system.So she\u0027s now attempting to boost the ones that are there already, with a \u0026#16350m fund to create thousands of extra places, many for pupils from poorer backgrounds.She has found a willing accomplice in Damian Hinds, a grammar school boy from Altrincham in Manchester\u0027s leafier suburbs, who was promoted to Education Secretary in the January reshuffle.His two predecessors in the job, Justine Greening and Nicky Morgan, both of whom were sacked by Mrs May, didn\u0027t care for grammar schools at all.Ms Greening, who last week urged employers to discriminate against applicants from Eton, is a steelworker\u0027s daughter from Rotherham who went to the town\u0027s Oakwood Comprehensive School.As the Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran put it, rather colourfully: \"We now know what we suspected. Justine Greening was moved on to make way for a lap dog for Theresa May\u0027s pet projects.\"So why the PM\u0027s enthusiasm for grammars? She and other supporters claim they\u0027re good for social mobility. Opponents say they do the exact opposite.After all, a grammar school in every town suggests a secondary modern in every town too. But you won\u0027t find many Tory MPs who support grammar schools backing a return of secondary moderns for children who fail the 11-plus.Ah yes, Tory MPs! Looking at the politics of all this, surely a big motive for the PM in the Government\u0027s \u0026#16350m handout to grammar schools is pleasing Conservative backbenchers. or at least those on the Tory Right.That\u0027s because Conservative MPs who love grammar schools are largely the same ones who hate the European Union.They\u0027re also the same MPs who are currently holding the PM to ransom on Brexit and threatening to topple her if she caves in to Remainers. So cynics will regard the latest boost for grammar schools as a sop to the Tory Right, a bone tossed in their direction in the increasingly bitter Brexit dogfight - even if the Prime Minister does indeed appear to have an obsession with grammar schools.According to political journalist Rosa Prince\u0027s biography of Theresa May, The Enigmatic Prime Minister, it was at school that she became interested in politics.By the time she was in the sixth form she was apparently confident enough to announce that she intended to become Britain\u0027s first woman Prime Minister."},{"url":null,"title":"more half britains richest hedge","story":"NewsMore than half of Britain\u0027s richest hedge fund managers have donated to the ToriesCity financiers who have given a combined £15.6million to the Conservatives named among 21 wealthiest fund managers in latest Sunday Times Rich List\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByGraham HiscottHead of Business17:50, 11 MAY 2018Updated20:21, 11 MAY 2018NewsTheresa May\u0027s Conservative Party has received big donations from hedge fund bosses over the years (Image: AFP)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwelve of Britain’s 21 richest hedge fund fat cats are Tory donors.

Ronald Russell, 49, passed away at his home in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, on July 4 last year. His family say that the landscape gardener lived alone and suffered from mental health issues. A transcript of the call was released by relatives of Mr Russell and reveals how his pleas for help went ignored by staff from the Scottish Ambulance Service. Medics finally arrived at his address 17 hours after the call – and only after a concerned neighbour contacted them.  According to the transcript, Mr Russell made the call from his mobile at 5.45pm on July 4, 2017 and requested an ambulance to bring him to hosptial. The call handler repeatedly asks “What’s the telephone number you’re calling from please?” despite being aware that the phone number was being displayed from their terminal. Mr Russell replied: Can you hold on until I get that? The call handler says Sorry? and he continues: “I’ve got this, I’ve I’ve got this, got it written down.”  The caller was heard moaning loudly throughout the call and his response is recorded as Ooooooh ohhh (incomprehensible sound from caller).” The call handler once again asks if he wanted an ambulance, ignoring his previous requests. Finally, after saying “hello?” five times without a reply, the call handler hangs up. In all, the conversation lasted three minutes.  The Ambulance Service rang his number three times to get Mr Russell back on the line but did not try to trace his address. They have admitted more should have been done to track Mr Russell’s whereabouts.  A Scottish Ambulance Service report said: “It is evident on listening to the call that the call handler can hear noises and moaning. The correct process was followed by providing three calls back, however, due to the call handler knowing that the caller was on the line before it disconnects, there could have been more attempts to confirm the address - or for this to be highlighted to a supervisor.” Ronald’s sister Margo Cassidy, 52, said: “It was really devastating to read that, especially because I think most people imagine that when you phone an ambulance the first thing they will ask is, “Where are you?” “We knew he had phoned an ambulance because we had his mobile.

The disturbing incident happened on the top deck of a bus bound for Leeds city centre in Yorkshire at around 6.30pm on Thursday. The 22-year-old has bravely waived her anonymity to help catch him.  She told  the man, wearing a red tracksuit, had been sitting at the back of the First UK vehicle when she got on, but moved forward as people started to get off. She realised something was wrong when she saw his reflection in the window. Karlah said: He came and sat opposite me on the bus. I could see something moving in the window, like someone was waving, but at first I didn\u0027t think anything of it. I turned around and the guy was looking right at me, dead in the eye.

She said there was one other passenger, a man, on the top deck of the bus when it happened, but he did not intervene. Karlah said she went downstairs and reported what had happened to the bus driver - but was stunned by his reaction.  He told me to sit downstairs, he didn\u0027t take down any details, she said. He just asked if it was the man in the red tracksuit. Karlah got off the bus two stops later, and said the man was still on the bus after her exit.

Dr Bhushan told the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing she had been haunted by the incident years later. She told how she had walked into the labour theatre at Ninewells Hospital to see Dr Laxman trying to deliver the baby despite the mother only being two to three centimetres dilated.   She broke down in tears during the hearing as she told the tribunal it was \u0027the most horrific experience anybody could have and it has haunted me so much\u0027, reports The Sun .  Dr Bhushan said: “I knew that this baby was extremely fragile. That the baby had significant bruising and that the neck was stretched.

And while Ms King may have a name \u0026shyworthy of royalty, that’s not her only \u0026shyconnection to the Duchess-in-waiting. Like the Suits star, Vicki is also 36 and, following a whirlwind romance with her own Prince Charming, is also set to tie the knot this summer. Now, after shedding 3st 3lb and four dress sizes, dark-haired Vicki has more than a sprinkle of Ms Markle’s sparkle. Still in shock at her fairy-tale \u0026shytransformation, Vicki, who has adopted Meghan’s style for our photo shoot, says: “I really can’t wait for my own wedding now. Watching the royal wedding will really get me excited, although no doubt they will have had a much bigger budget than us!” Vicki has gone from 12st 7lb to 9st 4lb and a dress size 16 to size eight, which means she now needs to have her wedding dress taken in.  “I bought it when I had only lost a stone,” she laughs. “Now it needs taking in and a huge chunk taken out of it. It feels fantastic as I’m so much happier and more relaxed. And now I picture myself in the dress and I know I will feel like a princess.” Administration officer Vicki had spent years lacking the confidence to dream of walking down the aisle – after trying to lose weight seven years ago. She had given up smoking at the age of 29 and had really seen the weight pile on as a result. A break-up led to a crash diet that helped her initially lose two stone but when Vicki met now-fiance Ross Miller, 39, on a dating website in 2014, she fell into a familiar trap... ending up putting even more weight back on. At 5ft 3in, she was 12st 7lb and a size 16. It wasn’t just that she felt unhappy in her clothes, it was knocking her confidence and increasing her anxiety. She says: “I lost weight too quickly after a stressful split and then, over time, I met Ross. As you do when you start dating, we were going drinking a lot and eating out.  “I found that I started to get really stressed and unhappy at work and, as the weight piled on, anxiety kicked in.  “Putting on weight was a mental and physical strain because I had no \u0026shyconfidence. I said to Ross, ‘I need to  do something, no one else is going to do  it for me’.”  The moment Vicki realised she really needed help was one day in June 2016, when she burst into tears after seeing herself in the mirror.  This time, Vicki, of Brighton, East Sussex, knew she had to lose the weight properly if she was going to keep it off. Having struggled with previous diets, she decided to go to a local Slimming World group after it was suggested by a colleague. And she was pleased to see losing the pounds didn’t mean going hungry. “Straight away, I couldn’t believe how much you can eat and what you can eat compared to what I was eating,” she says. “I’m a foodie and I wanted a plan where I could eat what I wanted – and I do. “When I was overweight, I never ate breakfast. I barely ate before lunchtime but I was eating all the wrong foods and too much food at the wrong times. Now I eat all day but it’s the right things.”  Vicki admits that before she started the diet she’d go for easy foods like a burger and chips or fried chicken, often washed down with half a bottle of wine. She also used to have an addiction to crisps, so decided she needed to completely cut them out. “I look back and think, ‘Oh my God, how did I eat that?’ I was eating crisps all the time. Now I just don’t buy them because I know I’ll eat them all and feel rubbish. It’s not worth it.” Instead, Vicki grazes on fruit and vegetables, has a healthy veggie lunch and still has a satisfying dinner such as homemade pasta, homemade chicken curry or a healthy roast. She is often eating more food than she did so previously.  “I have bigger portions than Ross! It’s all about loading up on lots of \u0026shyvegetables rather than just having the pasta,” she explains. “Sometimes I cut the pasta out completely.” And she hasn’t had to cut back on going out either. She still loves trips to Nando’s but will just choose skinless chicken options instead. Alongside her new food plan, Vicki took up running and signed up to her first half-marathon earlier this year but had to pull out due to injury. Just the thought of taking on such a challenge marks a massive change.  “When I was overweight, I really wanted to go to the gym but didn’t feel comfortable or confident,” she says. “So Ross got us an exercise bike and I started going on it three to four times a week for half an hour – it was great because no one could watch me. Then, in April last year, Ross and I signed up to the gym together. I started running four to five times a week.” Vicki found time for exercise by running to appointments instead of driving, and going to the gym early. “All I used to do was go to work, get home, sit down, eat and sleep,” she admits. “Now after work I will go to the gym or for a swim. It’s all about learning to make the time you have worthwhile.” But the biggest change was not just being able to buy a smaller dress size, she had won back her \u0026shyconfidence. She said goodbye to her anxiety and was back to being the warm, engaging person operations manager Ross had fallen for. Vicki even believes this new-found confidence is what inspired Ross to pop the question, six weeks after she started Slimming World.  “I remember how quickly I started to feel better about myself,” she says. “Every week I could see the numbers going down on the scales and that keeps you so motivated. “I knew I couldn’t miss a week because if I slipped up I wouldn’t go back. The progress keeps you going. “I think I was happier in myself and that made Ross feel happier. Although he’d never say that was what made him pick the timing, I think it played a part.” Vicki has two months before she and Ross follow in Meghan and Harry’s footsteps. While her wedding won’t be broadcast for millions to see, Ms King will no doubt feel like royalty.  Diet before   Breakfast: Nothing.

Luke Hicks burned two vibrators - worth \u0026pound66 - in anger because Danielle Gillies was away on a women-only night out. A court heard the 24-year-old found the two sex toys in a bedroom in a chest of drawers and set them alight in his rage. Hicks had downed 15 pints of lager as well as vodka and champagne during an all day drinking session at horse racing before heading to his girlfriend\u0027s flat. And he started a vibrator bonfire in fury at realising Danielle, 23, had gone out was out with the girls. His outraged girlfriend came home from the Cardiff night out to find the sex toys destroyed as well as fire damage to a cupboard.  Prosecutor Vaughan Pritchard-Jones said Ms Gillies dumped Hicks straight away and he spent the next nine days begging her to get back with him. But many of Hicks\u0027 messages turned abusive and he was charged with harassment. Mr Pritchard-Jones said: He let himself into the flat and burned two sex toys that she had in the bedroom, and made a small burn mark on the chest of drawers. He sent her a constant stream of texts over the next nine days. Some were abusive, but mainly they were trying to persuade her to get back with him.” Hicks was warned any further contact would be considered harassment, but Haverfordwest Magistrates heard he continued to message Ms Gillies anyway.  Insurance worker Hicks, of Kilgetty, Pembrokeshire, admitted criminal damage and harassment. Mike Kelleher, defending, said Hicks was extremely drunk when he entered the woman\u0027s flat. He added: “He had not expected his girlfriend to go out as well. He let himself into her property and found that she was not there. He had drunk far too much than was good for him. Mr Kelleher said Hicks continued to message the woman because she hadn\u0027t blocked his number. In his eyes, because he had not been blocked, he saw a glimmer of hope, he said. He accepts that the relationship is over. The texts were born out of a sense of frustration, which grew and grew.

At around 5.30am on August 5 last year, Joseph Dunkley, 46, was at Brixton Underground station when was approached by an unknown man, British Transport Police (BTP) said. After a heated argument, a fight broke out and Dunkley made lunges towards the man with a knife. The unknown man ran away and Dunkley walked into Brixton station, heading towards a Victoria Line train. Meanwhile, a group of males, including 18-year-old Samuel Gbo, entered the same station. On a northbound service, Dunkley confused Gbo with someone else and became violent.  During the journey towards Stockwell, Dunkley threatened the group of men with a knife and then stabbed Gbo. The teenager then produced a knife and stabbed Dunkley twice on the arm. At Stockwell, the disorder spilled onto the platform where police and paramedics attended. Investigating officer Pc Neil Lane, from BTP, said: Knife crime will never be tolerated on the London Underground network, and today\u0027s sentence shows the consequence of knife crime. The Tube network is rich with CCTV, and we use this vital evidence to identify offenders and bring them before the courts. Those individuals who are intent on carrying knives should see this sentence as a deterrent to this reckless behaviour.

The brave mum, who says “hope and perseverance remain”, has been carefully choosing gifts to reflect the teen\u0027s age.  She will place them, along with cards and messages of support, in Maddie\u0027s pretty pink bedroom which has become a shrine to her and remains unchanged since she vanished during a family holiday in Portugal 11 years ago.  Maddie’s great uncle Brian Kennedy said: “It would be lovely to have a celebration one day. We never lose hope.”   Kate, 50, previously said: “I do all the present buying. I think about what age she is and buy something that, whenever we find her, will still be appropriate so there’s a lot of thought goes into it.”  She referred to the birthday of her eldest child as a difficult time because that’s when you really feel her absence.”  The ex GP and heart doctor husband Gerry, 49, will also pray for their daughter\u0027s safe return during a low key family “party” at home.  Along with their 13-year-old twins Sean and Amelie they will also blow out candles on a special cake for the missing youngster. Maddie’s birthday falls just nine days after her parents joined an informal prayer gathering in their home village of Rothley, Leicestershire, to mark yet another painful anniversary of her disappearance in May 2007.  During the outdoor service Kate read a poem called The Contradiction to remember Maddie with haunting words: “I trace your steps, I map your face. You’re all I know and so unknown. I cannot hold you, yet I do.”  The couple cling onto a glimmer of hope that their daughter - who was snatched as a three-year-old - could still be alive and told in an anniversary message on the Find Maddie website that the continuing support from family, friends and well wishers was “a real tonic and boost to our spirit.”  They stated: “She is a real person and still our ‘little girl’ and as we always have we will endeavour to do whatever it takes to find her. “Hope and perseverance remain.  Kate, who is now a part time medical worker, still spends precious moments each day in Maddie’s bedroom which she reveals has “shocking pink walls and stars on the ceiling” and where her dolls and teddies are on display, along with an ever growing number of presents.

The Baking A Difference scheme, which started last year, uses bread baking to bring older people in care homes and sheltered \u2028housing together with local communities. “We are excited to get this funding because, although it is a simple idea, there are so many ways to explore it,” says project manager Fiona Smith. “Creative bread making sparks conversations, it keeps hands and minds busy, it offers physical activity and fun.” The money will help widen the project to other care homes and sheltered housing in Leicestershire, pay for the time and materials of a professional baker and train and mentor volunteers. “The idea is to create bonds of friendship and reduce feelings of loneliness, isolation or boredom,” adds Fiona.

At first, Jo Naylor told her sporty daughter Amelia, 10, to ‘stop being silly’ when she fell on the grass after crossing the finish line following the 2km run. But when she saw her daughter’s eyes roll back in her head and noticed that she was not breathing, the nurse and mum-of-two quickly went into first aid mode. Mrs Naylor said that it had just been a normal day before the terrifying incident at Swithland St Leonard’s CofE School in Loughborough. “I thought she was a bit slow, I seem to remember shouting ‘pick up your pace,’” she said.  During the race, Amelia, who was house captain of the running team, had slowed down to help a friend who was struggling. But after she crossed the finish line, it was Amelia who suddenly needed urgent, life-saving help. “She lay down on the grass and said, ‘Oh mummy I can’t breathe.’ “She became unresponsive. Her eyes were rolling back and she wasn’t answering me. It was clear she was not messing around,” Mrs Naylor said. She called for an ambulance and then realised that her daughter was not breathing. With tears in her eyes recounting the incident, Jo continued: “I laid her on her back, lifted her chin and double checked to see if she was breathing then, but she definitely was not.  “I gave her mouth to mouth, and she didn’t respond. So I checked for a pulse, I could not feel one so I started chest compressions. After one minute I thought she’d sit up,” Mrs Naylor said. But when her young daughter remained slumped and unresponsive, the nurse knew she was in cardiac arrest. In a cardiac arrest, the heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body, quickly starving the brain of oxygen and causing the patient to fall unconscious and stop breathing. Without CPR or urgent medical attention, a cardiac arrest quickly proves fatal. So Mrs Naylor gave her daughter chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth for 20 long minutes which kept her oxygenated and alive while they waited for help.  When the ambulance arrived, paramedics grabbed a defibrillator to shock her heart in the hope that it would reestablish Amelia’s normal rhythm. “The ambulance guy gave her a single shock. Her heartbeat stopped. And then it restarted. It was so exciting,” Mrs Naylor said through tears of emotion. Amelia was rushed to hospital where surgeons discovered that her left coronary artery was connected in the wrong place. She was operated on at Glenfield hospital in Leicester where doctors corrected the faulty connection, and Amelia, who collapsed on September 13 last year, was well enough to return to school last November. But Mrs Naylor knows that without the bystander CPR her daughter received, she would have died before the ambulance arrived that day. She said that CPR is a simple but life-saving skill that everyone can and should learn and she has shared her story ahead of the fifth annual Restart a Heart Day on October 16 which aims to teach a record-breaking 200,000 people life saving skills. Mrs Naylor said: “Doing something is better than doing nothing. I remember as a student nurse saying ‘you can’t get any deader than dead.’  “If someone has collapsed and their heart has stopped you cannot do any harm but you can help. “Simple skills save lives. Everybody in the family now knows how to do CPR. Everyone in the whole world should know how to do it. You never know when you’re going to need it. If you give it a try you might just save a life. Every year, there are more than 30,000 cardiac arrests outside of hospitals in the UK and less than 10% of these people will survive. But if CPR is started early, it can double a person’s chance of survival. The Restart a Heart campaign, led by Resuscitation Council (UK), St John Ambulance, and other organisations aims to improve these shockingly low survival rates. On Tuesday 16 October, organisations all over the world will join forces to increase public awareness of cardiac arrests and increase the number of people trained in CPR. Events will be hosted in schools, community centres, hospitals and emergency service stations to train people in essential life saving skills.

The monarch was all smiles at the Royal Windsor Horse Show, where the 96-year-old Duke of Edinburgh was spotted in public for the first time since his hip operation five weeks ago. Royal aides had said recently they “hoped” Prince Philip would be at next \u0026shySaturday’s wedding. But his swift recovery was clear for all to see as he drove himself around the equestrian event – and wound his window down to talk to the Queen. Final preparations for Harry and Meghan’s big day are being put in place, with 100,000 people expected to line the streets of Windsor.  Fans have been advised to set off as early as 4am for the noon ceremony. Extra trains have been laid on for \u0026shypassengers \u0026shytravelling from across Britain.

The Ryanair employee was seriously injured after the commander of flight FR-3247 from Stuttgart, Germany, attempted to correct an overspeed, UK investigators have found. The plane was at 40,000ft and the pilot was about to bring the plane into land last January when a strong wind sent the Boeing 737’s speed up from 600 to 630mph in just than 30 seconds - setting off a warning alarm. According to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch report, he reacted by applying ‘double the pressure needed’ on the control. The sudden movement made two flight attendants working in the galley - the plane’s kitchen - fall and one was left with a broken ankle. The 31-year-old commander later said he’d suffered a ‘startle effect’ - when a pilot makes a ‘reflex reaction due to exposure to a sudden, intense event that violates their expectations’. It was around 4.45pm last January when the pilot was preparing to descend with both the autopilot and autothrottle engaged. There was no turbulence and the seatbelt signs were off, the Manchester Evening News reports . When the windspeed display started to rise, the pilot later reported, the autopilot ‘appeared not to be correcting the condition, and thinking that he had little time to react, he simultaneously pressed the autopilot disengage button his control wheel and pulled back on the control column. “His intention was to avoid the overspeed as smoothly as possible using manual control inputs.”   Luton Airport workers vote in favour of strikes meaning potential travel chaos for Brits over the bank holiday weekend and school half term  But data analysis showed the pilot’s pressure on the control column increased from 0.51lbs to 42.76lbs. This was ‘double the pressure required’ to disconnect the autopilot. All 89 passengers were unharmed and the plane went on to have a safe landing in Manchester. Afterwards, the pilot - who had been flying with Ryanair since 2010 and had recorded 4,997 flight hours - reported that he was aware of the possibility of encountering a jetstream in the descent but had not seen the airspeed increase to this extent before. “At the time he thought he was managing the manoeuvre gently but with hindsight he suspected that startle effect caused him to exert more force on the control panel than intended,” said investigators in the report, adding: “The commander commented that he learned from his experience, particularly in relation to managing the reduced operational margins and handling sensitivities of the aircraft at high altitudes.” Related video - Woman has mid-flight tantrum as passengers demand her removal "},{"url":null,"title":"stephen hawkings family invite time","story":"NewsStephen Hawking\u0027s family invite TIME TRAVELLERS to his memorial service to try solve mystery that eluded famous scientistTime travellers have been invited to celebrate Stephen Hawking\u0027s life - but they will need to prove when they were born\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAnna Slater13:03, 12 MAY 2018NewsProf Hawking spent his life trying to prove time travel (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Stephen Hawking\u0027s family have invited time travellers to his memorial service to try and solve one of the curiosities that eluded the scientist during his extraordinary life.  The world\u0027s most recognisable scientist died in March aged 76, after spending his career probing some of the universe\u0027s biggest mysteries.  He was particularly interested in time travel and in tribute to that, his family are inviting people from the future to celebrate his life with them.  People can apply for tickets for the event in Westminster Abbey - but must include their correct date of birth on the form.  This can be any day up until the end of 2038. The option to have a date of birth in the future was spotted by London blogger ianvisits who wrote on his site: Professor Hawking once threw a party for time travellers, to see if any would turn up if he posted the invite after the party. None did, but it seems perfect that the memorial website allows people born in the future to attend the service. Look out for time travellers at the Abbey.  The ceremony will be held on June 15 and his ashes will be interred alongside the graves of Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin. Hawking suffered from rare-early onset slow progressing form of motor neurone disease, which parlayed him and left him unable to speak.

Forecasters are keeping watch of a ridge of high pressure on course to skirt the British Isles and lure warm and sunny weather back towards the country. Values are expected to rise up to 4-8C above normal for the time of year on Monday and Tuesday as warm air from the south dislodges the current cool and unsettled westerly airflow. Some computer models are indicating highs could reach close to 20C in north-east England by Tuesday, and up to 15-19C elsewhere. The best of the weather will be in central and north-east England where high pressure will supply a brief window of sunshine and high temperatures.  However, scattered showers are still likely in the south and west on Monday, followed by further outbreaks on Tuesday - although these will be largely confined to north-east Scotland. The balmy outlook comes after forecasts of heavy rain and thunder in parts of the west this weekend as a series of lows from the Atlantic take charge. Temperatures will also dip below average in places over the two days, with risk of frost in Northern Ireland and Wales, before rising sharply from Monday.  Katie Greening, forecaster of The Weather Channel , said the mercury will spike early next week after a bout of cool and unsettled weather over the weekend.  She said: Temperatures will be unseasonably cool the time of year next week, but spiking slightly above average Tuesday. High pressure forecast, with sunny spells and fair weather likely. The warmest day will be Tuesday, with highs peaking at 19C in London. The higher temperatures will be as a result of the flow of warmer air from the south ahead of low pressure. In its wake temperatures will lower in the following northerly to north-westerly wind.” "},{"url":null,"title":"cotton bud stuck mans ear","story":"NewsCotton bud that was stuck in man\u0027s ear for TWO YEARS removed in grim footageWARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES: The man only realised it must have got stuck inside his ear after going swimming and the cotton swelled up\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByCharlotte RegenKelly-Ann Mills22:44, 11 MAY 2018Updated00:18, 12 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man had a cotton bud removed from his ear he was unaware had been wedged there for two YEARS He only realised it must have got stuck inside after going swimming and it swelled up, causing him a lot of pain.

Even before their wedding seven years ago, Kate was a fixture in the public eye, popping in and out of Mahiki, shopping on the King\u0027s Road and being spotted skiing with William and their aristo chums. The couple dated for 10 years prior to getting engaged, and even squeezed in one break-up. While we know William had ex girlfriends , little is known about Kate\u0027s romantic history. But, believe it or not, she does have one... There are some very handsome men lurking in her past, and it definitely looks like she had a type. Willem Marx The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met at university, meaning they\u0027ve known each other for pretty much all of their adult lives.  However, before university, Kate dated Willem Marx, who is now a reporter and, according to his Twitter bio, author of Balochistan at a Crossroads (the proceeds of which going to Polio eradication). London-based Willem works for CNBC and covers geopolitical and company news across Europe including Brexit , US-Europe relations and international security.

Henry Ropner News in 2007 that William and Kate had split shocked the British public, who\u0027d assumed they\u0027d soon be announcing their engagement.

The enormous hairy blob surfaced last night at around 7pm and was immediately thought to be a \u0027globster.\u0027   Marine workers arrived to take samples of the unidentified creature which they say smells awful and like something from another planet.  Villagers in the Oriental Mindoro province in the Philippines flocked to see the 20ft long dead carcass, posing for selfies with it. But others fear it is the sign of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake.  Resident Tam Maling said: An earthquake is heading for Oriental Mindoro. The big globster is a sign of something bad coming. Please pray for us. Vincent Dela Pena Badillo added: Many were alarmed including me when we learned the news about it. It has been told that when creatures from the deepest parts of the ocean start appearing, something bad will happen.

to Craigie High School and Morgan Academy, a Mary Slessor tour, visits to the Hot Chocolate Trust and the Cafe Church at the Steeple and a visit to the Verdant Works.Mary Slessor, who is commemorated

association Home Group Scotland are behind the multi-phase plan to develop brownfield land between Haddington Avenue, Berwick Drive, Lothian Crescent and Dunbar Park in Whitfield.The homes will sit directly behind The Crescent community centre, and will be close to Ballumbie Primary School and the new North East Campus “super-school”.Proposals for the first phase of the development, containing 13 homes that will sit on Haddington Avenue, were unveiled earlier this year.In a planning statement submitted by Merchant Homes and Home Group Scotland (HGS), the firms said the development would suit the Whitfield area due to the ongoing residential regeneration that has unfolded over the last two decades.The land on which the new homes will sit was once the site of the Skarne-style blocks which dominated the Whitfield skyline.The new homes, the planners have pledged, will have affordable rents and be energy-efficient.The companies jointly said: “The proposal is for residential development that will provide a viable and marketable development consisting of private and affordable housing.“This is an awkward and challenging site in terms of shape, topography and existing services.“These factors have largely shaped the approach that has been taken to the development of the layout for the three phases.“Consequently, it is felt that the proposals respond to the client’s brief and the requirements of Dundee City Council’s Local Development Plan to provide a design solution of high quality, which harmonises with the location and provides a development of high quality for the future residents.”In all, the completed development will have 41 homes, all of which will have driveways, and 75% of the homes will have at least three bedrooms.HGS is also involved in other developments in the Whitfield area, such as the new-build homes which have been constructed on Summerfield Avenue.The developers have said the homes will look much the same as those that have been built already.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ross county wide man michael gardyne on dundee and uniteds radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWIth survival assured on Tuesday night, Dundee boss Neil McCann’s “recruitment drive” for next season is up and running.And one possible arrival could be Ross County playmaker Michael Gardyne – though, the Dark Blues may well have competition from across the city on their hands.The Dundonian is out of contract at the end of this season and, with his roots down here, a move back might be on the cards.His history with Dundee United – where he played 37 times in season 2012/13 – however, makes Tannadice a more likely destination for the 32-year-old.That’s likely to be dependent on whether Csaba Laszlo’s men can win promotion to the top flight via the play-offs.The Dark Blues won’t comment on any possible signings but gaffer Neil has been able to get working on improving his squad for next season after the 1-0 win at Ross County saw them guaranteed a ninth-place finish.He said: “The plans we’ve been looking at over the past five or six months in terms of recruitment we can actually start to push forward with now and start a bit of a recruitment drive.“I don’t think you can ever push on it 100% until you know you’re going to be safe.“Tuesday’s win allows us to start forward thinking but there’s still business to be done.“I’m not going to disrespect Ross County by going into Saturday (against Partick) and taking the foot off the gas and go through the motions, because we have to be professional.”Partick sit two points ahead of the Staggies in 11th spot and still with the possibility of catching Hamilton and jumping to safety. That’ll take a swing of 13 goals, however.With Thistle at risk of automatic relegation if they are beaten by the Dark Blues on Saturday, Neil knows his side will have to be on their game if they are to finish the season off on a high at Dens Park.He added: “We have to look to win it and, if we do our business right, we can hold our heads high.“We want to win at home. We’ve got back-to-back wins in the split and we’re looking for three.“I charged the boys with the task of getting five wins from five games – we’ve had three out of four and we’ll look to go into Partick and make it four out of five.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/bowman-390x575.jpg ","title":"tannadice game chance for arabs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBids are now being taken for fans wanting the chance to play at Tannadice in Dundee United legend Dave Bowman’s ninth annual charity match to raise funds for skin cancer and dementia charities.The game between fans making successful bids and a team of past tangerine greats takes place on Friday week with a 6.30pm kick-off.This year the fans’ team will be turning out in a special kit in honour of United’s roots as Dundee Hibernian.“This is now the ninth year of these games taking place and there is no doubt I am getting slower,” said Bowman.“The old fire is still burning so nobody better try to beat me on the park.“Seriously, this is always a great evening and a lot of fun and every year it makes me happy that players from all ability levels take part in the game.“It is all about enjoying the game.
