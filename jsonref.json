She described herself online as a killer whale trainer who worked at Loro Parque Sea World in Tenerife, where she met her boyfriend          Friends and family said the disappearance was entirely out of character for Amy and admitted they were worried for her safety\u0027Her friends thought something was amiss on Friday and went to the police station but were told that they should come back the following day if she didn\u0027t turn up at work as scheduled to officially report her as missing.\u0027That was what they did when she didn\u0027t show for work on the Saturday. She wasn\u0027t due in to work on the Friday.\u0027He added: \u0027Amy wasn\u0027t a big drinker. She had to be in good shape for her work so like her colleagues who work with animals, she just didn\u0027t do the party lifestyle.\u0027We\u0027ve ruled out the idea she might have come out the pub the worse for wear and fallen somewhere on her way home because that was just not Amy.\u0027She was with a female friend as far as we understand but we haven\u0027t been able to speak to her yet.\u0027We would urge anyone who has seen Amy or has any information on what happened that night or where she might be to contact police.\u0027We\u0027re not exactly sure at the moment what police are doing but we know they\u0027re taking it seriously and are looking for her and trying to find out what\u0027s happened.\u0027Friend Tonette Smith said: \u0027Just so everyone knows this is a local lass.\u0027Amy Louise Gerard from Cleethorpes lives in Tenerife working with sea mammals.\u0027Amy has been missing since Thursday midnight.

But more because the brothers have seemed so close throughout their lives. Until now, that is.    It now seems likely that William and Kate will spend Christmas not only apart from Harry and his pregnant wife Meghan, but many miles awayWith the stream of disclosures threatening to become a torrent, The Mail on Sunday understands courtiers at Kensington Palace have started a ‘mole hunt’ in an attempt to stop leaks to the media that have led to so many unfavourable reports.They have certainly not made for comfortable reading. Insiders have claimed, for example, that a rather ‘dictatorial’ Harry has been throwing his weight around, aggrieved that neither his brother nor courtiers and servants have been ‘rolling out the red carpet’ for his new American bride.It has been suggested that Meghan has been brusque with servants and that her exacting wedding preparations led Kate to burst into tears following a bridesmaid fitting for daughter Charlotte. It has been a stressful time all round, it is true. Kate has only recently given birth to her third child, Louis, while Meghan finds herself a newcomer in a foreign land – and a member of the most extraordinary family in Britain. Perhaps a few early false steps and antagonisms were to be expected.Kid Rock gets booted from his grand marshal gig at Nashville...Carole Middleton says she has stopped reading stories about...Kicking up a stink: \u0027Dictatorial\u0027 bride Meghan wanted air...Furious Duchess of Cambridge \u0027fell out with Meghan Markle...Share this articleMeghan, who has worked hard to master her new Royal brief, is well-liked not just by the public, but by her new father-in-law, Prince Charles. He admires her work ethic and shares an interest in the arts.But the MoS understands that the unease between the Cambridges and the Sussexes is more long-standing and has been deeper than has so far been suggested.As early as last Christmas, well before the May wedding, Meghan was suggesting she didn’t feel entirely welcome with all members of the family. And it was in response that Charles attempted to smooth things over by engineering an invitation to Anmer Hall – William and Kate’s country home near Sandringham. He hoped it might bring the couples together.It didn’t go well. Indeed, one well-placed source says the occasion was marred by a ‘ghastly row’ between the couples – one reason there will be no repeat this Christmas. A senior Royal aide has revealed that the atmosphere at Anmer soured shortly after Harry and his then fiancee had arrived, and Meghan was judged to have been ‘downright rude’.          The MoS understands that as early as last Christmas, well before the May wedding, Meghan was suggesting she didn’t feel entirely welcome with all members of the family‘Kate had a quiet word with Meghan,’ says the aide. ‘It escalated rapidly after Meghan complained to Harry that she had been “told off”.‘He took her side, while William defended Kate, who was five months pregnant with Louis and certainly didn’t want this sort of confrontation.’Kate, it is said, already felt put upon in being asked to host Meghan and Harry. Tired and pregnant, she had been hoping for a quiet Christmas. Perhaps the strain showed.At any rate, the atmosphere was ‘poisonous’ for a while, continues the aide, and only thawed with a visit by Charles, who was told by William what had happened and did his best to jolly everyone along.This is by no means an isolated example of Meghan’s supposed high-handedness, according to chatter in Royal circles.A new book by Royal commentator Robert Jobson even claimed Harry had previously told one staff member: \u0027What Meghan wants, she gets.\u0027The MoS understands that the unease between the Cambridges and the Sussexes is more long-standing and has been deeper than has so far been suggested (pictured: Meghan and Kate at the wedding of Princess Eugenie)This newspaper has learned from one of William’s closest friends that the Prince had doubts about how suitable Meghan might be as his brother’s bride – and that he voiced them.It is understood William’s concerns reached the ears of the Queen and, more pertinently, of Harry himself. One member of William’s circle told the MoS: ‘The problem is that the Cambridges felt things had moved very quickly between Harry and Meghan. Wills particularly was worried and felt close enough to Harry to voice his thoughts.’The two boys were brought especially close by the death of their mother, and William has always kept an eye out for his younger brother. But few of us like it when our romantic choice is questioned – and this appears to be the case with Harry now.Royal observers are asking, too, if William fears that Meghan is in some way assuming the space occupied by his late mother Diana. A beautiful, fashion-loving Royal determined to make her mark through charitable works? The parallels are inevitable.          The two boys were brought especially close by the death of their mother, and William has always kept an eye out for his younger brotherKate, in contrast, has taken a less showy approach to her role. She has dutifully accepted advice on how to dress and how to deport herself as a Royal, whereas Meghan has so far seemed determined to strike out on her own – on occasion at least.It is understood that Kate has had a number of meetings over tea in which she has attempted to explain the rules of The Firm to Meghan – and that her advice didn’t go down well. Kate is said to have told friends she was very sad about what was happening and felt that Harry was ‘changing’.‘She and Harry have always had a very close relationship, but she said things were different,’ says one. But if William’s wife has become adept at fading into the background, that does not make her soft.On the contrary. ‘Meghan’s a strong character and so is Kate, so it doesn’t surprise me there have been clashes,’ said the source.Indeed, some are calling her a Steel Marshmallow, a phrase first applied to William and Harry’s great-grandmother, the late Queen Mother.With the days that William, Kate and Harry went around together as a dynamic team now decisively over, they are leading lives that are not only increasingly separate, but very different.Harry and Meghan spent a considerable part of the summer in their rented house in Oxfordshire where they entertained friends including George and Amal Clooney, and tennis star Serena Williams. Theirs is a markedly more celebrity-driven ‘court’ than has been normal for the Royals in recent times, and quite different from the so-called Turnip Toffs who make up William and Kate’s group of friends in Norfolk.And with the celebrity associates, it seems, come celebrity anxieties.So uncomfortable have they grown with a steady stream of media disclosures, it seems that Harry and Meghan are now determined to bring them to a halt.It will be fascinating to see just what or who the Royal ‘mole-hunt’ unearths."},{"url":null,"title":"Man surprises fiancee SIX enormous diamond engagement rings pick elaborate proposal","story":"Dennis Brown II, 32, dispensed with the engagement ring guessing game when he proposed to his now fiancee, Atara Dallas  He cleverly presented her with a heart-shaped box containing a half dozen sparklers in a wide variety of shapes and settings  In posting their lavish engagement photos on Instagram, Brown, a model and actor, wrote that while he hadn\u0027t managed to win six NBA championship rings like Michael Jordan, \u0027I won at life with her so she deserves #6 Rings to choose from.\u0027  In the series of photos, Dallas, a teacher and restaurateur, appears barely able to contain her surprise when a sharply-suited Brown gets down on one knee and presents her with the super-sized red ring box containing the six engagement rings          Dallas is seen snapping a selfie.

They think of other people.\u0027\u0027Bush understands that politics is politics and friendship is friendship,\u0027 an agent who was on his detail says. \u0027He can be friends with a lot of people who may not agree with him. The only things that bothered him were things that were important to the country. Little things just kind of seemed to roll off of him.\u0027When Bush—code-named Timberwolf—was vice president, agent William Albracht was on the midnight shift at the vice president\u0027s residence. While agents refer to the President\u0027s Protective Detail as the Show, they call the Vice President\u0027s Protective Detail the Little Show with Free Parking. That\u0027s because, unlike the White House, the vice president\u0027s residence provides parking for agents.Albracht was new to the post, and Agent Dowling filled him in.\u0027Well, Bill, every day the stewards bake the cookies, and that is their job, and that is their responsibility,\u0027 Dowling told him. \u0027And then our responsibility on midnights is to find those cookies or those left from the previous day and eat as many of them as possible.\u0027Assigned to the basement post around 3 a.m., Albracht was getting hungry.\u0027We never had permission to take food from the kitchen, but sometimes you get very hungry on midnights,\u0027 said Albracht.  \u0027I walked into the kitchen that was located in the basement and opened up the refrigerator. I\u0027m hoping that there are some leftover snacks from that day\u0027s reception, It was slim pickin\u0027s. All of a sudden, there\u0027s a voice over my shoulder.\u0027  George W.

Bush was assisted by Secret Service as he leaves the ballpark after watching the Houston Astros play the Chicago Cubs at Minute Maid Park in 2011\u0027Hey, anything good in there to eat?\u0027 the man asked.\u0027No, looks like they cleaned it out,\u0027 Albracht said.\u0027I turned around to see George Bush off my right shoulder,\u0027 Albracht said. \u0027After I get over the shock of who it was, Bush says, Hey, I was really hoping there would be something to eat. And I said, Well, sir, every day the stewards bake cookies, but every night they hide them from us.\u0027With a wink of his eye he says, Let\u0027s find \u0027em. So we tore the kitchen apart, and sure enough we did find them. He took a stack of chocolate chip cookies and a glass of milk and went back up to bed, and I took a stack and a glass of milk and went back to the basement post.\u0027When Albracht returned to the post, Dowling asked, \u0027Who the hell were you in there talking to?\u0027Albracht told him what had happened. \u0027Oh yeah, sure right,\u0027 Dowling said.Agents noted the contrast between George H. W. Bush and Al Gore, one of Bush\u0027s successors as vice president. Like Hillary Clinton, Gore - who also claimed to be a champion of the \u0027little people\u0027-treated agents with disdain and told them he did not want to be bothered greeting them or seeing them.\u0027Gore told agents at his home in Carthage, Tennessee, that they should duck behind bushes when they rotated shifts because the Gores didn\u0027t want to see them,\u0027 a former agent says. \u0027I was on the detail one Christmas when Gore was at his home in Carthage,\u0027 former agent Jeff Crane says. \u0027Neighbors offered us food on Christmas Day, but the Gores never even bothered to say \u0027Merry Christmas\u0027 or \u0027Thank you.\u0027Hillary Clinton, who continues to be protected by the Secret Service as the spouse of a former president, is so nasty to her agents that being assigned to her detail is considered by agents to be a form of punishment and the worst duty assignment in the Secret Service.Like Bush, President Trump treats his agents with respect and consideration.

He was to have dinner at the Chart House seafood restaurant on North Garden Street, on the banks of the Boise River.\u0027The way we protected him, we had some agents inside, but typically what we\u0027d do was situate ourselves at dining tables near him,\u0027 Dowling says.Dowling had been seated for a few minutes when he heard a radio transmission: Two white males in camouflage outfits and carrying long weapons were creeping around the back toward their location. They were crawling on their bellies, moving themselves along with their elbows.Just then, Dowling looked up and saw the two bad guys. He thought of intelligence reports that Libya had sent a hit squad to the U.S. to kill American officials. The agent instinctively jumped out of his chair and tackled Bush to protect him. Food flew everywhere as Dowling threw the vice president on the ground and flopped on top of him.\u0027What\u0027s going on here?\u0027 Bush demanded to know.\u0027I don\u0027t know, but just keep your head down,\u0027 Dowling answered.Dowling looked up. He saw dozens of law enforcement officers with their guns drawn—Secret Service agents, sheriff\u0027s department deputies, and state troopers. They were on the scene as part of routine protection for a vice presidential visit. The two bad guys were kneeling with their hands clasped behind their heads.\u0027We evacuated the VP out of the restaurant to get him away from whatever danger may have still been there,\u0027 Dowling says. \u0027You would think I had just thwarted an assassination attempt.\u0027As it turned out, the restaurant was near an apartment complex where the girlfriend of one of the two men lived.\u0027The guy had gone to see his girlfriend, and she was there with another guy,\u0027 Dowling said.          Former Washington Post and Wall Street Journal journalist Len Kessler with President Trump. at Mar-a-Lago. Kessler says the president treats his agents with respect and consideration\u0027So the boyfriend got very angry. The other guy who was there with his girlfriend pulled out a knife, kind of slashed him, didn\u0027t hurt him badly. So this fellow who had been cut decided that he and another guy were going to go back and kill the guy that night.\u0027Not knowing the vice president was coming, they parked in the lot at the Chart House and decided to sneak through the woods to get to the apartment complex. They were tried and convicted on illegal weapons and attempted assault charges.Despite warnings from his detail, Bush would insist on leaving the Oval Office through the door to the Rose Garden and greeting tourists lined up along the fence on Pennsylvania Avenue. Bush\u0027s detail leader assigned agents to rush to the fence as soon as an alarm notified them that Bush had opened the door to the outside. Soon, the Washington Post ran a story reporting that tourists were delighted at their unexpected encounter with the president. Trump warns Democrats he\u0027ll \u0027close the entire Southern...George H.W.

Anne Boleyn, portrayed by Natalie Dormer in the Showtime series The Tudors, was executed by her husband Henry VIII in 1536, after their marriage sparked the English Refomration  Over the course of their tumultuous marriage, Anne gave birth to a daughter who would go on to become Queen Elizabeth I, but failed to produce a male heir.In 1536, Henry ordered Anne to be executed by decapitation after trying her for adultery and incest.Samantha, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and is wheelchair-bound, has been feuding with Meghan since before the wedding, most often about her estrangement from their ailing 74-year-old father, Thomas Markle. Meghan, 34, and Harry, 37, are set to welcome their first child together sometime between April and May, which is when Samantha is planning to release her book, titled In The Shadows of The Duches, which, in the author\u0027s words, promises to uncover all of her sister\u0027s \u0027lies\u0027 and shed light on the rift in their family.In a tweet on Saturday, Samantha accused her sister of \u0027ghosting\u0027 their entire family.Samantha\u0027s barbed comments directed at Meghan come amid a litany of reports suggesting that the newly minted duchess and her royal husband have had a falling-out with Prince William and his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge.           Samantha has accused Meghan of ghosting her father Thomas and their side of the familyIt was also suggested that the mom-to-be duchess was overly demanding with staff, and that her personal assistant quit after being reduced to tears. Last month, it was announced that Harry and Meghan were moving out of Kensington Palace, where William and Kate reside with their three children, and relocating to Windsor. Despite a steady drumbeat of stories painting a picture of a strained relationship between the two royal couples, last week it emerged that William, Harry and their wives will join the Queen and other members of the royal family at Sandringham for Christmas, in an apparent show of unity.  "},{"url":null,"title":"A look Bush family American political dynasty","story":"    George H.W.

I\u0027ve had it all my life.\u0027Christmas was not an extravagant affair when I was a child growing up in South Wales.\u0027In the late 1940s you\u0027d get a Christmas sock and inside it was a tangerine, nuts, some loose change and small presents. It was very simple but enjoyable.          The tree, which is thought to date back to 1937, sits in a painted pot and has a few sparse branches featuring the odd goose feather dyed green and a sprinkling of red berries\u0027On Christmas Day we had a chicken from the lady at the back of our house who bred them.\u0027I think we enjoyed Christmas more back then. Because we didn\u0027t have much, we valued what we did have.\u0027I was given a train set when I was 11 and I only parted with that eight years ago. It was still in mint condition with its original box.\u0027These days, some children get thousands of pounds spent on them and don\u0027t appreciate it because they\u0027re used to having so much.\u0027My father had to start work down the mine at the age of 13 because his mother had been widowed twice, there were four children to feed and the rent had to be paid. He worked in mining for 49 years.\u0027He retired at 62 and lived until he was 77. He was a lovely, strong man - my parents were what I call good folk. The village where I grew up had a strong community spirit. Money was scarce but we always had one good cooked meal a day.\u0027Now Steve, who has lived in Leicestershire for 51 years, is looking forward to Christmas 2018 - but without his family festive tree.He added: \u0027Let\u0027s hope it finds an exciting new home and puts a sparkle into Christmas for generations to come.\u0027Last Christmas, a similar tree - without any decorations - sold for £420 at Hansons and was bought by the American Christmas Tree Association.Department store Woolworths started selling some of the first mass-produced artificial trees in the 1920s."},{"url":null,"title":"Cressida Dick reveals 180 heavily armed gangs roam streets London","story":"Cressida Dick, the head of the Met Police, said that there are 180 gangs in the capital \u0027working hard\u0027 to recruit young children          Researchers have attempted to map the \u0027territories\u0027 of London\u0027s many competing gangsHowever, she insisted knife injuries among under 25s were starting to drop after police increased the use of stop and search powers and erted road police officers to troubled areas.Ms Dick said: \u0027I think we are beginning to see the tide turning in that we are putting more officers on the streets, we\u0027re doing more stop and search, we\u0027re seizing more knives, we\u0027re seizing more firearms, we\u0027re arresting more people for knife and gun crime.\u0027And we are begining to see, after three years of knife crime increasing and gun crime increasing, they are now not just levelling off, they are coming down.\u0027Wild West shoot-out in Wimbledon: Police hit man in exchange...Ex-Labour frontbench MP is accused of wasting police time...Share this articleThe Commissioner backed the use of \u0027tactical contact\u0027 by police, which has seen police drivers knocking into moped muggers who refuse to stop.During a phone-in on LBC radio, Ms Dick was also asked about Joshua Gardner, who attacked a motorist with a zombie knife in south London, but walked free from court on a suspended sentence.The Commissioner said police had referred the case to the Attorney General, who can bring appeals against sentences which are considered \u0027unduly lenient\u0027.

All of them are in Leonardo’s left-to-right mirror writing and all shine light on his astonishing, way ahead of his time genius.Gates, the founder of Microsoft, bought the Codex Leicester at auction in 1994. It was previously owned by the American oil tycoon Armand Hammer, who purchased it in 1980. Before that it was in Britain, passed down through the Leicester family after Thomas Coke, later the Earl of Leicester, bought it on his grand tour of the European continent in 1719.About a third of the notebook has writings and drawings that relate to water, with Leonardo speculating on the outcomes when different-shaped objects are thrown in to water.It also includes a discussion on submarine warfare in which he describes how it might be possible to extend the time a person can stay under water and how that might have possible military uses.The Codex Arundel is the world’s second biggest compilation of Leonardo pages and features everything from treatises on mechanics and bird flight to drawings of underwater breathing apparatus, as well as riddles, prophecies and notes for himself.Andrea Clarke, the exhibition’s lead curator, said the notebooks showed just how dynamic a thinker Leonardo was and how he made a multitude of connections between phenomena and disciplines.This will be the first time the notebook has been seen in the UK since Gates bought it. A plan to loan it to the V\u0026ampA in 2006 foundered because of a disagreement over security arrangements.The library announced the exhibition as part of a 2019 programme that includes a show exploring Buddhism, opening in October, and an exhibition opening in April about the act of writing itself, which will feature exhibits including a wax tablet with the homework of an Egyptian child dating from 2AD."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77aee7fec382787977abb1df8d3e6e1d5b575fd9/0_0_3543_2876/master/3543.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=786ed346a1548562a79cb488a7756f41 1010w","title":"andre aciman announces sequel to call me by your name","story":"Author of the novel behind Oscar-winning romance says he will return to story of Elio and Oliver, after the director revealed his own plans for a follow-up filmAndré Aciman has revealed that he is writing a sequel to his bestselling novel Call Me By Your Name, which was adapted into an Oscar-winning film starring Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer.A coming-of-age story detailing the poignant summer romance between teenager Elio and the slightly older Oliver, a graduate student who visits Elio’s family home in Italy, Aciman’s 2007 novel was adapted into a film last year.

This was naïve at best, and in the event has proven disastrous. And so Project Fear turned into Project Impossible. It is incompetence on a monumental scale,” he added, in a comment piece for Bloomberg.The Whitehall elite had been proved wrong during previous periods of uncertainty and been found to be wrong again with predictions of an economic downturn following the referendum in 2016, he said.“In the 1930s, with appeasement in the 1970s, when the British economy was the ‘sick man’ of Europe and the government saw its role as managing decline and now, in the turmoil that has followed the Brexit referendum. In all three cases, the conventional wisdom of the day was wrong,” he said.With less than than four months before Brexit, it remains unclear whether Britain will leave the EU with a transition deal that ministers believe will prepare the way for a trade agreement that gives UK companies favourable access to continental markets.Last week, the BoE warned that Britain would suffer an economic shock if it left the EU without a deal.Appearing before MPs on Tuesday, Mark Carney, King’s successor, defended Threadneedle Street’s record from critics who accused it of producing “dubious” and “highly speculative” forecasts of a deep recession following a no-deal Brexit.Carney said the scenarios, which were commissioned by parliament and set out by the BoE last week, were based on detailed work to ensure banks and other lenders were ready for Brexit, and were not off-the-cuff predictions.“There’s no exam crisis. We didn’t just stay up all night and write a letter to the Treasury committee,” Carney said at a hearing in parliament. “You asked for something that we had, and we brought it, and we gave it to you.”King, said he backed the comments of the Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman, who described the Bank’s Brexit calculations, which included a catastrophic loss of trade, investment and productivity, as “dubious”.Carney said stress tests on the banks had shown they could withstand any Brexit shocks and allow people to sleep “soundly at night”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aaed4c7f1e7e1c9893e2d00986874ce7659fb15/0_98_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6132d281566878f9009a5bc6d64e03d","title":"thomas cook shares debt","story":"Travel firm’s bosses try to reassure investors as its value slips below the size of its debtThomas Cook shares tumbled further on Tuesday and the cost of insuring debt issued by the travel firm against default hit a record high, despite its efforts to reassure investors over its worsening performance and £389m debt mountain.The slump in the share price has slashed the firm’s market value to just over £300m, from £2.2bn in May.

The price of its 2022 euro-denominated bonds tumbled more than 11 cents to a record low of 71.371 cents.The Thomas Cook chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, and its interim chief financial officer, Sten Daugaard, are this week meeting with investors worried about the firm’s financial strength and strategy.Their concerns were exacerbated when the firm gave a less detailed outlook for next year than in the past, adding to fears over the impact of Brexit or another crisis in a major package holiday destination such as Turkey.The 177-year-old travel company scrapped its idend last week and blamed a “disappointing” year on the prolonged summer heatwave across Europe, which meant people delayed their bookings, especially in the UK, and travel firms had to discount their packages heavily in the late booking market.The firm’s net debt has risen to £389m, partly due to delayed bookings. This was far higher than the City had expected, and rather than eliminating debt by 2020 as forecast by analysts, the group is looking to reduce debt by 2022 when its bank covenants expire.The Berenberg analyst Stuart Gordon warned last week that Thomas Cook shares were “uninvestable” and said another fundraising round was “back on the agenda”.

And it only released its analysis because parliament demanded it.We had a core team of 20 senior economists working on this for a couple of years.There’s no exam crisis. We didn’t just stay up all night and write a letter to the Treasury Committee. You asked for something that we had, and we brought it and we gave it to you.Perhaps a pop at David Cameron’s reputation as an ‘essay crisis’ prime minister, who got Britain into its current bracing condition?Carney did receive some support from MPs. Labour’s John Mann thanked him for his work, and labelled Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg “contemptuous of parliament” for criticising the BoE so sharply last week.Carney went to some pains to explain that Bank officials had examined a range of scenarios -- not just the worst-case disorderly Brexit which dominated the headlines after the analysis was released last week.But he also laid out fresh reasons for people to worry.He also warned that Britain’s border infrastructure isn’t prepared for a swift move to WTO trading rules.At this point in time, the ports are not ready for a move to an administered-WTO relationship... where we move to a WTO relationship with customs checks on both sides of the border.Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe concurred, having visited the port of Dover himself to check the situation:That may be all for today.....And here’s our news story on Lord King’s Brexit blast:Here’s our news story on the latest warnings from the car sector:Brexit is proving rather inconvenient for convenience foodmaker Greencore.Greencore told shareholders this morning that it simply doesn’t know the “near-term” challenges of Britain leaving the EU without a deal.But it has been doing its best, with a group of staff working on Brexit planning since the referendum in 2016. That group has examined issues including “material sourcing and labour availability”, and developed various mitigation plans.In practice, that means stockpiling frozen prawns, ready to fill the nation’s sandwiches, and tomato paste for Greencore’s range of soups and sauces.Former BoE governor Lord King’s attack on Theresa May’s Brexit deal concludes:If this deal is not abandoned, I believe that the U.K. will end up abrogating it unilaterally — regardless of the grave damage that would do to Britain’s reputation and standing.Vassal states do not go gently into that good night. They rage. If this parliament bequeaths to its successors the choice between a humiliating submission and the abrogation of a binding international treaty, it will not be forgiven — and will not deserve to be.The Treasury committee seemed to accept Mark Carney’s defence of the Bank of England’s Brexit analysis.Mervyn King, who led the BoE into and through the financial crisis, has criticised the BoE’s work.Writing for Bloomberg, Lord King says he’s not convinced that the UK would plunge into a savage depression after a no-deal Brexit, or face endless disruption at the border.It saddens me to see the Bank of England unnecessarily drawn into this project. The Bank’s latest worst-case scenario shows the cost of leaving without a deal exceeding 10 percent of GDP.Two factors are responsible for the size of this effect: first, the assertion that productivity will fall because of lower trade second, the assumption that disruption at borders — queues of lorries and interminable customs checks — will continue year after year. Neither is plausible. King is even more savage about Theresa May’s Brexit deal, comparing it to the failure to challenge Hitler in the 1930s.There have been three episodes in modern history when the British political class let down the rest of the country: in the 1930s, with appeasement in the 1970s, when the British economy was the “sick man” of Europe and the government saw its role as managing decline and now, in the turmoil that has followed the Brexit referendum.In all three cases, the conventional wisdom of the day was wrong. While Mark Carney was speaking, the UK car industry has been giving its own Brexit warnings to MPs.As flagged up earlier, Toyota is expressing great concern that a no-deal Brexit would scupper the flow of lorries through the Channel TunnelQ: Why did you present your Brexit analysis on the same day as the Treasury published its work? Doesn’t that undermine your independence, asks Steve Baker?Mark Carney repeats the Important Point from the Bank of England -- the banking system is strong enough to absorb whatever Brexit throws at it.They’ve got masses of highly liquid assets, and the BoE is standing by with brimming pots of liquidity (I’m paraphrasing) just in case the commercial banks are locked out of the wholesale money markets for months.We could be having a discussion about excessive caution.Q: So who decided when your report would come out?This committee, replies Carney, laying down his ace with a flourish.Q: Did Number 10 decide when, and how, your report would come out.Absolutely not, the governor insists, wagging a finger.Carney has one more shot -- telling the Treasury committee that it would “do well” to remind the media that MPs asked to see its Brexit analysis. That’s why it was released.That’s the end of the session.Finally, an old friend (!) is back on the committee -- Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister (and Leave campaigner).Baker says he’s got more sympathy for governor Carney than he expected -- it’s clear that the Bank worked in an “admirably dreary way” to assess the impact of Brexit, and prepare the financial system to cope.Q: So given that, how do you feel about the media’s coverage of your Brexit analysis?This country has a “varied and vibrant” media, says Carney, and the report ‘landed differently’ in different parts of the media. Sometimes your words and analysis are used differently by different iniduals who have certain priors. That’s life.Carney repeats his earlier point -- the committee demanded the Bank’s work on Brexit, so the Bank provided it.Q: Did the media reporting help financial stability?Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe says the report makes it clear that the Bank had considered various scenarios. It’s also important that the Bank has shown that the UK banks can ride out a disorderly Brexit.You discover in financial crises that confidence matters a lot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/178d7ed1b7b45cafb6b86b01d1c05ffd8f0d680c/0_220_6588_3953/master/6588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dd0fb8a11eb3dacb348ac52c5389cbc","title":"chris grayling transport secretary railways","story":"The transport secretary has long presided over a shambles of a public service and now stands accused by the cross-party transport select committee of failing to take proper responsibility for the rail timetabling crisis that turned so many lives upside down earlier this year. Children missed school lessons, adults feared for their jobs and livelihoods because they couldn’t get to work on time, furious passengers were forced to fork out for taxis and emergency childcare. If this were France, we’d probably be manning the barricades by now, not tweeting crossly about the 7.37 being delayed yet again.Yet still Chris Grayling steams on, chuffing merrily on the BBC’s Today programme about how he and his department probably should have asked tougher questions of the rail operators now you come to mention it but – well, they didn’t, and here we are. Here he still is. The railways in their heyday were a symbol of ingenuity and progress but increasingly they’ve just come to embody all the embarrassingly basic things Britain can’t seem to do properly any more.In any normal period of political life Grayling would probably have been reshuffled by now, driven out if nothing else by fellow Tory MPs in commuter seats who fear an electoral backlash. But the man with the reverse Midas touch is safe so long as Brexit drains all Westminster’s energy and attention. Not only is he one of the few prominent leavers who hasn’t resigned yet, and therefore almost untouchable, but there is a more pressing omnishambles occupying the front pages. When the history of Brexit comes to be written, all the intractable but still solvable problems that didn’t get sorted because the entire political system was convulsed by one impossible fantasy should loom large. But that’s no consolation to anyone standing on an overcrowded platform right now.In fairness to Grayling, it’s not all his fault. The select committee report makes it clear that the timetable debacle back in May was a “complex system-wide failure” for which Network Rail, train operators, regulators and the department must all share responsibility and which was driven by different factors in different parts of the country. Grayling was ultimately the only person with the power to halt the timetable changes but the report makes it clear that he wasn’t given the information he would have needed to do so, while arguing that he should have tried harder to ferret that information out. It is the train companies who swore they were ready to cope (when they so palpably weren’t) who have so far borne the brunt of the pitifully limited punishment dished out, with Grayling announcing yesterday that Govia Thameslink will keep its franchise but won’t be able to take a profit this year.But it’s the transport secretary who perches on top of a teetering, crazily fragmented pile of rail bodies and ultimately the buck stops with him. The lesson learned painfully in so many departments of state over the last couple of decades is that farming politically sensitive decisions – whether it’s the rationing of new drugs on the NHS or the management of changes to the benefit system – out to arm’s length quangos or third sector providers works only until something goes horribly wrong and voters demand to know how their elected representatives are going to fix it. Accountability sticks to politicians, even sometimes when the power to do anything much about it has been devolved away. The choice facing all ministers in public service departments is either to get a grip on the system as it is, ensuring that at the very least they pick up on early signs of trouble and have levers to pull in case of emergency, or to declare the system not fit for purpose.Too late, Grayling hints that he ought to have done the latter, arguing that the rail network has grown too big and too busy to be managed as it currently is (although he’s still staunchly against renationalisation). The snag is that given his track record, the prospect of Grayling embarking on a hugely complex reform with far-reaching consequences for people’s lives at a time when Downing Street is too overstretched to supervise closely is probably more alarming than the prospect of Grayling doing nothing. It would be Andrew Lansley’s NHS reforms with bells on.What’s needed is a competent, politically canny new transport secretary given the freedom to think again, ideally in a government with time to focus on ordinary lives rather than interminable constitutional wrangling. Instead, what we’re likely to get for the foreseeable future is more Chris Grayling. See you on the replacement bus, then."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ddb5a5a126e14abfac6fa746d9004e5072aaff3/0_80_2944_1767/master/2944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90988f488ca79d5950bb790bea8a23a7","title":"the housemartins how we made happy hour","story":"‘I started getting letters from pub landlords saying that people were jumping on tables to it. I don’t know if many listeners realised it’s about women being harassed’Happy Hour started off as a song called French England, years before I formed the Housemartins. I was working in a ledger office in Surrey, and as a northerner I saw that whole area as part of France. So the original first line was “French England, what a good place to be”.Then I started listing things that annoyed me about the office. At lunchtime, the sales reps would come in with their smiles and all the gel and shit on their hair. “Coming down the hatch lunchtime, Paul? Coupla birds in the George and Dragon …” Which I could not stand, because I’d moved down from Sheffield, where we didn’t talk about women like that. When I formed the band in Hull, much of this stuff made it into Happy Hour.We wrote it in my house in Grafton Street on Wednesday 22 January 1986 – I know the date because I kept a diary. Flag Day had got to No 10 in John Peel’s Festive 50 and we’d landed a Peel session so needed some more songs, and along came Happy Hour. As a song it contains one of my main themes – shovelling too many words in – but it worked.On Tuesday 3 June it was at No 58. Then it just kept rising. I didn’t know that my life would never be the same again. When we did TV shows I thought it would be the first and last time so I pestered the other acts for autographs. I got Paul McCartney’s at Razzmatazz and Bill Oddie’s in BBC reception after we did Top of the Pops.Happy hours were big then – a golden hour of cheap drinking which would encourage stupidity – and something just connected. I don’t know if many people realised that the song was about feeling miserable in a happy hour, or that the lyrics make loose statements about women being harassed. After the song became a hit, I started getting letters from pub landlords saying: “Your song smashed up my pub! As soon as it came on the jukebox people started jumping on the tables. Then everybody started dancing and the tables all collapsed.”Paul’s house in Grafton Street was like student digs. We’d meet there and have a slice of toast. Paul had his lyrics in a little notebook and I had chord progressions in mine, and we’d put them together to write songs. We’d just written Me and the Farmer and I wanted to go for a “bun run” – a trip to the local cake shop. But Paul was adamant that we needed one more song, so we came up with Happy Hour. I was so desperate to get to the cake shop that I used the same chords for the chorus in the verse, but because Paul sang a different melody over it and I did the “It’s happy hour again” backing vocals, it worked. We recorded it on a little cassette recorder, I chucked down my guitar and ran for a custard slice. The whole thing can’t have taken us much more than 10 minutes. I certainly never thought: “This is going to be a massive hit.”The idea for the video came to us in the pub. I loved Morph, the little animated clay character on Tony Hart’s TV show, Take Hart, so we got some student animators to make plasticine animations of all four Housemartins. We shot the pub scene in the Star in St John’s Wood in London. It starred Phill Jupitus, who was our road manager and support act for a while. The girl in the video is Wendy May, who was a mate of ours from a bluegrass band called the Boothill Foot Tappers. Everything felt very low-key and modest. We were the self-proclaimed “fourth best band in Hull”, big in our own little world of John Peel and NME, but then Happy Hour just took off.I’m constantly amazed and humbled that people still listen to it after 32 years. I write kids’ books now and work in schools engaging primary school children in reading and writing. Sometimes I joke with them, “Hey, I used to be a pop star! Who believes me?” They never do, until the teacher shows them the Happy Hour video and they all go: “Oh my God. It’s true!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28fb8b94ddebe668a279829986bd0754c03af349/0_176_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=318f48b259a4f84e6ba09c367259e17c","title":"what went wrong with the netflix marvel bromance","story":"The streaming giant has pulled the plug on Daredevil, shortly after giving Luke Cage and Iron Fist the chop. Is the age of the superhero over?Musicians, actors, crimefighters, they should all follow the same advice: get a trade. Something to fall back on. You know, just in case you don’t make the big time, or Netflix cancels your series.Let’s not worry, then, about Matt Murdock now that the streaming giant has pulled the plug on Daredevil after three solid, if unspectacular, seasons. While his days getting his hands dirty in Hell’s Kitchen might now have been drawn to an end, hopefully the not-really-blind martial artist can get back to his day job: practising law.Given the news in October that Murdock’s partners in crime-fighting, fellow Defenders Luke Cage and Iron Fist, were also getting the (karate) chop, perhaps the writing was on the wall. If it was, however, it wasn’t visible to Daredevil’s writing staff, who were, according to one of the writers, mid-meeting, throwing about ideas for the fourth season when they got news of the cancellation. While I probably don’t want to sit through another 13 hours of Daredevil doing what should really take him only six, it would be interesting to know what they had in store.There’s no news as yet on the fourth Defender, Jessica Jones, or The Punisher, breakout star of Daredevil’s second run, but with both due to return to our screens next year – Jones’s third season started filming in June, and the second series of The Punisher is nearing completion – it seems unlikely that Netflix would leave them unaired. It’s also just as unlikely these two would be singled out for a stay of execution, especially given what a slog Jones’s second season was. Expect announcements in the near future, but good luck to anyone who has to tell Jon Bernthal he can’t play Frank Castle any more. Email might be best with that one.So why the cancellations? Quality could be one reason. Executives might have had enough of fair-to-middling superhero adventures that cost a fortune to make. Daredevil’s recent third series served up more of the expected blend of staggering fight scenes – Murdock and Bullseye’s stationery-based face off was thrilling – while Kingpin once again proved to be Marvel’s best on-screen baddie, even if he had to negotiate boring dialogue and a stagnant plot.Iron Fist was mostly terrible, even if the second run was an improvement on the first, and Luke Cage managed to make a show about a bulletproof man, who was also superhumanly strong, deathly dull. Viewing figures – not something Netflix is very forthcoming with – aren’t available, but reports suggest the numbers were down from one series to the next. The Defenders, the small-screen Avengers, if you will, apparently saw figures drop with each episode.It’s not quality and figures that seem to be at the heart of these cancellations, but business. Disney, which owns Marvel Studios, makers of these series, is launching its own streaming service, called Disney+, and it’s highly unlikely it wants valuable characters fighting crime on another service.Marvel waved goodbye to Daredevil with a message saying it “looks forward to more adventures with the Man without Fear in the future”, hinting that there could be a life beyond Netflix – a big-screen reboot, perhaps? – although Disney’s family-friendly image would probably stop it just continuing the grisly series as it is, while Netflix still owns the streaming rights to these axed characters, and will indeed keep the series on its platform for the foreseeable future. How smart a move that is, however, will reveal itself in due course. Netflix’s Marvel series are all heavily stylised and feature consistent branding. As its collaborator becomes a competitor, does it really want to carry what is essentially an advert for not just a rival streaming service, but the company that is probably going to withdraw most of its content from Netflix?If you’re worried where your next superhero series is coming from, fear not. Neither firm is going to go without, with Netflix launching its own universe in collaboration with Mark Millar, and Disney+ reportedly planning live-action TV shows featuring Loki, Scarlet Witch, the Winter Soldier and any of its other MCU characters it doesn’t think warrant a whole film. There’ll also be a raft of animated Marvel content.The age of the superhero is far from over. Perhaps Matt Murdock won’t need to go back to the day job just yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/236464e898aefc157ff3e4265eae66eff905664c/0_90_4650_2790/master/4650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87e32576502484fddec7c9c525323022","title":"the lowdown on ottawa canadas capital city","story":"Whether you want to do mass yoga, visit parliament, try a BeaverTail pastry or ice skate on the Rideau canal – Ottawa has something for every visitor …The city of Ottawa has a wonderful setting, its centre perched on cliffs above the churning Ottawa River and overlooking the peaceful rolling forests of the Gatineau Hills. Once a rowdy lumber town, it quietly developed into one of the country’s most handsome and liveable cities federal money backed impressive architecture and still supports a rash of top-flight national museums, while careful planning kept the city centre walkable and put the great outdoors a mere 15-minute drive away. There’s also a sizeable gastro and brewpub scene, along with a packed festival calendar. And there’s an appetite for some unusual activities too: how about the weekly mass drop-in yoga sessions on the parliament’s iconic lawns, or ice-skating the Rideau canal – the world’s largest rink – in the very centre of the city with a BeaverTail pastry in hand? See it for yourself …Food and drink form a big part of the Ottawa lifestyle. Farmers’ markets always bustle and hot new restaurants continually pop up around a city that already boasts the full range of choices, including dozens of ethnic eateries in districts such as Chinatown. Try the classic French cuisine at Sur Lie, or the innovative menus at Stofa. Elsewhere, the emphasis is often on casual and healthy, with modern vegetarian places such as Pure Kitchen as popular as any. Ottawa’s microbreweries all thrive too, with craft ales universally loved: the city’s beer festivals, such as the Winter Brewfest in February or the Ottawa Beerfest in June, burst at the seams brewery bus tours thrive and getting a table at a hip beer-focused restaurant, such as Bar Lupulus can be a challenge. Alongside the award-winning chefs and popular eateries is the much-loved BeaverTails pastry stand: its speciality is a huge doughnut flattened into the shape of a beaver’s tail then smothered with a topping. Barack Obama made sure he got one when he visited as president in 2009.Tours of Ottawa’s gothic parliament buildings are not to be missed you can visit both the House of Commons and the new Senate to observe democracy in action. The city’s national museums are another strongpoint, partly for their distinctly Canadian twist. From reconstructed polar environments to birch-bark canoes and contemporary art, all provide a wonderful window on the nation.The Canadian Museum of History has a particularly insightful glut of historical artefacts, including an extraordinary totem pole collection. For greater insights into today’s Canadian culture try the National Gallery of Canada, where airy contemporary art displays steal the show from old masters. Better still, take in a show at the dynamic National Arts Centre, whose bilingual performing arts programme includes all sorts of music, dance and theatre. Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot appears in November and the NAC English Theatre has highlights of Prince Hamlet, Angelique and The Pigeon King early next year.Ottawa has a reputation for a dramatic climate, based on temperatures that swing between –30C and +30C and, no matter the weather, the city excels at making the most of the outdoors all year round.An extraordinary 500-mile network of cycle paths, many groomed for skiing in winter, is a key asset and with many being attractive riverside affairs, getting about by bike is often the best way to see the city.Otherwise, the Gatineau Hills are the main destination for summer hiking and biking, while in winter they support one of Canada’s premier cross-country skiing networks, as well as good snowshoeing to remote cabins and some downhill skiing at Camp Fortune. All this is nicely rounded off by the Nordik Spa-Nature with its medley of rustic saunas, hot tubs, treatments and massages.Avoiding Ottawa’s January and February extremes might seem wise, but then you’d miss all the fun of the February Winterlude festival – a carnival of ice sculpting, canal skating and BeaverTail bingeing. Instead, don’t worry about the temperatures – Ottawa always seems to take the climate in its stride.Take to the river in the summer months you can go white-water rafting on the Ottawa River. The city is also the master of the big occasion and leads the nation’s Canada Day celebrations on 1 July. Otherwise, there really are festivals on every week so there’s no bad time to visit.Discover all Ottawa has to offer for your next trip with Canadian Affair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79aa4ea96b7c0d5034ea858dba566a26777fffbf/0_144_6011_3607/master/6011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff7035365e69f39ec692742cb6e2b205","title":"get the lowdown on quebec canadas biggest francophone province","story":"From bustling Montreal to historic, cobblestoned Québec City and the mighty St Lawrence River \u001f– Québec mixes old Europe with metropolitan style and jaw-dropping natural beautyThere’s a huge swathe of wilderness up in Nord-du-Québec, with the majority of the population concentrated around the southern regions, mostly in the Greater Montreal area. Fun-loving, festival-obsessed Montreal itself is a bustling metropolis, home to nearly 2 million people, while the province’s capital, Québec City, may be more modestly sized but packs a historical punch.The mighty St Lawrence River slices through Québec’s south-eastern edge, lined on either side with a succession of pretty towns and villages. Here, away from the urban sprawls, you’ll see whales, bears and birds and more, in their natural habitat. And all across the province you’ll find delicious and award-winning food, which uses the best fresh, local produce.With so much prime, arable land, it’s no wonder Québec has a strong farm-to-table scene. You can follow the Flavour Trail in Charlevoix, north of Québec City, a 30-mile route stretching from Petite-Riviere-Saint-Francois to La Malbaie, encompassing cheesemakers, lavender-growers, apple orchards, breweries, and even an emu farm. Try some of the results of these delicious ingredients at the charmingly rustic Faux Bergers in Baie-Saint-Paul.On the south bank of the river, in the tiny waterside city of Rimouski, chef Colombe Saint-Pierre scours the St Lawrence River for bounty such as crayfish and lobster to cook in her restaurant, Chez Saint-Pierre. At the other end of the scale, the award-winning Toqué restaurant in Montreal places those regional ingredients at the centre of classic French-style cuisine, under the auspices of renowned chef Normand Laprise.Québec is big on microbreweries, too the province has over 150 of them, and celebrates beer with several festivals, from Québec City’s Festibiere, to the festival des Bieres de Laval. In Montreal, look out for quirky Dieu du Ciel! which sells 20 of its beers on tap, or Le Saint Bock, which has over 40 – it even makes poutine with beer.For wine-lovers, the Eastern Townships in south-eastern Québec province is the place to explore. Here, among picturesque rural towns and villages, you will find over 20 wineries, as well as some great restaurants using ingredients sourced from local rivers, lakes, forests and fields. Try Le Hatley at Manoir Hovey in North Hatley or, for a vegan option – with many ingredients grown in the back garden – Gaïa, in Bromont.As you might expect, a big city like Montreal is positively brimming with galleries, museums, and cultural experiences. The historic and the modern sit side by side – just yards away from the cobblestones of Old Montreal, for instance, is La Grande Roue, a 60-metre-high observation wheel that was opened in September 2017 to celebrate the city’s 375th birthday. From your cabin, you get great views across to Mount Royal hill. Also you can see Jacques Cartier Bridge, which, every evening, becomes an interactive, illuminated art piece called Living Connections. Social media users can dictate the patterns it forms using a Twitter hashtag.The city also uses light for Aura, an immersive, son et lumiere experience at the magnificent Notre Dame Cathedral. And you can learn more about Montreal’s history via Cité Mémoire, a series of projections on to historic or significant buildings around the Old Port, which tell the story of the city.To see all Montreal’s public art, pick up the public art map. You can create your own cultural walk – and get to know the city intimately at the same time.In Québec City, find out more about the region’s aboriginal people, and how the province came into being, at the striking Musée de la Civilisation or browse over 38,000 artworks at the Musée National des Beaux-Arts. There are also scores of beautiful churches to visit, such as the 300-year-old Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, with its 19th-century frescoes that tell the story of both the church and the city. Twenty miles up the St Lawrence River, you will find the ornate Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré and its recent addition – a striking 10-metre-high fountain of Saint Anne.Québec is primed for an outdoor lifestyle, its mix of mountains and rural farmland peppered with dense pine forests, steel-grey lakes, and emerald, patchwork fields. About 80 miles north-east of Montreal is Mont-Tremblant, one of the province’s main and most popular ski resorts. In winter, you can ski one of its 95 pistes, but you can also visit year-round for its golf courses and hiking trails.Whale watching around the St Lawrence River is incredibly popular belugas stay there year-round, and, during feeding season (May to October), you’ll also spot minkes, fin whales, and even humpbacks. You can see them in the Saguenay–St Lawrence marine park from three regions: Charlevoix (Tadoussac), Côte-Nord (Les Escoumins) or Bas-Saint-Laurent (Rimouski).If you prefer your creatures more furry, head to the Domaine le Pic-Bois, where you can observe black bears at close quarters. And if you just want to stretch your legs while taking in beautiful scenery, head to one of Québec’s national parks. Parc national de la Jacques-Cartier is just half an hour from Québec City, and has a spectacular glacial valley or you could visit parc national de la Gaspésie, where deer, moose and caribou roam.There’s plenty to do here all year round, and, unsurprisingly, Québec does winter very well. The bonus of snow means you can enjoy a range of sports and outdoor pursuits, from snowmobiling to skiing and snow-shoeing. You’ll also warm up pretty soon at the coldest music festival in the world, January’s Igloofest, and the Carnaval de Québec in February, with its parades, parties and outdoor sporting events.In spring, go cider-tasting on the Ile-aux-Coudres, an island in the St Lawrence River, or brave the zipline over the nearby Montmorency Falls, 30 metres higher than Niagara. For culture vultures, the festival TransAmériques in Montreal in late May and early June showcases three weeks of world-class drama and dance directed by top choreographers, artistic directors and playwrights.Summer’s the best time to stroll around cities and discover street art, or head to one of the big festivals in Montreal. Try the Jazz festival in June and July, Just for Laughs in July, or the Fringe festival in May and June.In Québec City, check out the festival d’Été de Québec, an 11-day music festival in July that attracts some of pop and rock’s biggest stars. Foodies should note First Fridays, where the biggest gathering of street food trucks in Québec pitch up at the Parc Olympique on the first Friday of every month, from May to October.Watch the foliage burst into colour in the autumn around Mont-Saint-Anne, and don’t miss the Great Color Adventure, a fall event featuring more than 145 km of cross-country and downhill mountain bike trails, and great hiking trails.Discover adventures all over Québec with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69d8bf4197f0431930b5b940cead27b15ab6129a/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fed11099b379fa115ffd7aa7b3c9ff5","title":"watch it or do it where to see and try canadas best sports","story":"Marathons, races, international contests … There’s much more to Canada’s sporting scene than the world’s best ice hockey. Here’s where to catch the best events – and get in on the actionMarathon running: Fogo Island Race Weekend – Fogo Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, 15 September 2018Fogo Island — Newfoundland’s largest offshore island — is one of the most unusual marathon locations on the planet. The race weekend features a 10km runwalk, a half marathon, and a full marathon that takes participants through Fogo’s beautiful, untamed wilderness. If you’re not running yourself, you can cheer on the returning marathoners in the picturesque village of Tilting, or go for a scenic hike through the island’s 200km of paths and trails. It’s worth the ferry ride alone to stay and dine at the architecturally stunning Fogo Island Inn. Fun fact: members of the Flat Earth Society consider the island one of the four corners of the planet.Canadian Football: 106th Grey Cup – Edmonton, Alberta, 25 November 2018The biggest night of the Canadian Football season will take place this year in Edmonton, Alberta, with the 106th Grey Cup game. A five-day, fan-friendly festival precedes the big game, a Canadian tradition dating back to 1909. This Grey Cup game is outdoors, so if you can snag a ticket, be sure to bundle up ... and don’t forget your face-paint. Canadian football, with its unique quirks, is particularly popular in Western Canada where fans never sit on their hands, no matter how cold it gets. For your own taste of three-down fun, The Edmonton Sports and Social Club has an indoor Flag Football League that begins on 23 September and runs for five weeks. Perfect for all beginners, flag football is a great non-contact introduction to Canadian Football and friendly Edmontonians.World Junior Hockey Championships – Vancouver, British Columbia, 26 December 2018-5 January 2019The World Junior Hockey Tournament has become a favourite year-end tradition in Canada, as the best young hockey players on the planet take part in a two-week tournament that culminates in a must-watch gold medal game. This year, Vancouver, BC, plays host at Rogers Arena, where traditional rivals Team Canada and Team USA remain the heavy favourites, with the young Swedes of Tre Kronor a close third. If that inspires you to lace up your own skates, check out the Robson Square Ice Rink, a beautifully lit, domed outdoor rink in the heart of Vancouver. An evening skate is popular with locals, and many of Van City’s best nocturnal snack options, including some top-notch food trucks, are close by. Skates can be hired for as little as Can$4 (£2.40).Curling: the Tim Hortons Brier – Brandon, Manitoba, 2-10 March 2019You can cut the tension with a broom at the Tim Hortons Brier where the country’s best male curlers have competed to represent Canada at the World Curling Championships since 1927. This year’s tournament takes place in friendly Brandon, Manitoba. The 2006 Olympic gold medallist Brad Gushue of Newfoundland and Labrador was skipper of last year’s championship team and the eventual winner of the World Curling title. If you want to take a crack at some rock-hurling yourself, head down the highway to the historic Granite Curling Club in Winnipeg. Known as the “St Andrews of curling” for its contribution to the sport in Canada, this historic club has produced its fair share of Canadian curling royalty, including Victor Alvin “Vic” Peters.Snowboarding and freestyle skiing: Jamboree 2019 – Quebec City, Quebec, March 2019The 2019 International Ski Federation Snowboard and Freestyle Ski World Cups will be awarded at Jamboree, Quebec City’s annual extreme winter sports festival. Big Air, Slope Style and Half-Pipe are just a few of the categories up for grabs by competitors from across the globe. Not surprisingly, there’s no shortage of outdoor concerts and parties, which are also held at nearby Stoneham, Quebec. For your own snowboarding adventures, either stay put at Stoneham, which has 135 hectares (333 acres) of skiable terrain, or drive to nearby Mont-Sainte-Anne. Ideal for black diamond experts and beginners alike, Mont-Sainte-Anne features 71 trails covering 44 miles (71km) on three different sides of the mountain.RBC Canadian Open – Ancaster, Ontario, 3-9 June 2019The Canadian Open is the premier Professional Golfers’ Association tour event in Canada, and is one of the oldest golf tournaments in North America (it dates back to 1904). The 2019 Open will be played at the historic Hamilton Golf and Country Club, in Ancaster, Ontario. Thanks to recent changes to the PGA calendar, the Canadian Open has been moved to early June, a change that is likely to attract more top-ranked golfers, some of whom had previously been unable to come north due to scheduling. If all that polite clapping at the Open has you itching to hit the links yourself, you’ll want to head north to the Muskoka Bay Club. Ranked as one of the best in Ontario, this Doug Carrick-designed course incorporates the rugged beauty of the region into the course layout and provides a distinctly Canadian golfing experience.Global Relay Canadian Road Championships – Victoria, British Columbia, June 2019Victoria, BC, will once again host the Global Relay Canadian Road Championships in June 2019. The race, which features top cyclists from across Canada, takes competitors through Canada’s “Garden City” and into nearby Metchosin, on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. For a cycling experience that’s completely different, head north to the Yukon – the land of the midnight sun. Whitehorse’s 24 Hours of Light Festival, also held in June, is the only 24-hour mountain biking race in the world where lights are illegal riders rely on natural illumination instead. Located in the heart of the Grey Mountain trail network, this exciting course is approximately 12.5km long with 277m of elevation. In keeping with the laid-back nature of Canada’s North, the event is only as competitive as you want it to be.Gold Cup and Saucer Race – Charlottetown, PEI, August 2019Old Home Week – an annual celebration of all things agricultural and more related to Canada’s tiniest province – includes the largest street parade east of Montreal, and a one-of-a-kind harness-racing competition. This late-night horse race – where the horses don’t gallop, but move at a trot, and pull a two-wheeled cart called a sulky – begins with the playing of the Island Hymn, followed by the Call to Post at exactly two minutes to midnight. And then, they’re off! If you’re not too exhausted from the previous night’s equestrian fun, there are a number of unique horseback riding opportunities for visitors along PEI’s red beaches and throughout its bucolic countryside. Try Brudenell Riding Stables, located 40 minutes outside Charlottetown on the island’s east coast.Helly Hansen Chester Race Week – Chester, Nova Scotia, August 2019The largest race of its kind in North America, The Helly Hansen Chester Race Week is an exciting, four-day, keelboat regatta that was first officially documented in 1856. Every August, more than 1,200 sailors set off from scenic Mahone Bay to compete in one of 15 fleets racing simultaneously on five different racecourses along the picturesque South Shore of Nova Scotia. Spectators can watch the races from the docks or inside the historic Chester Yacht Club. Once the boats are tied up, the party begins, with live music at the yacht club. For your own Nova Scotia sailing adventure, contact Star Charters in the nearby (and equally quaint) town of Lunenberg. Taking in a Nova Scotia sunset on the Eastern Star, their 48-foot tall ship, is an experience not to be forgotten.2019 Canadian Sprint Canoe Kayak Championships – Regina, Saskatchewan, 27 August-1 September 2019Located in the heart of the sunny Saskatchewan capital, Lake Wascana will welcome thousands to the 2019 Canadian Sprint Canoe Kayak Championships.

In 2017 the figure was more than 4,000.The number of requests for EHC assessments that were either refused or delayed have also increased dramatically. In 2017 there were about 14,600 refusals by local authorities to carry out an assessment – a third more than two years earlier – to the frustration of desperate parents.Spielman also raised concerns about the number of children with special needs who appeared to disappear out of education altogether. Almost 5,800 pupils with SEND left their school between years 10 and 11 some of whom will have been removed from the school roll illegally, because they are perceived as difficult to teach or at risk of bringing down GCSE results.The report also flagged up a widening gap in performance and outcomes for children with SEND, between the worst and best local areas. Of the 68 local area SEND inspections carried out, there were serious failings in 30.The chief inspector’s findings come at a time of mounting anger among parents of children with SEND who say vital support services are being withdrawn. A number of parent groups around the country have already launched legal action against their local authorities to try to resist further cuts planned for SEND provision.A separate legal action has been launched against the education secretary, Damian Hinds, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, whom parents accuse of failing to provide local authorities with sufficient funding to pay for SEND services for their children.While acknowledging that the quality of education and care in England is “good and improving”, Spielman used her report this year to highlight the “deep inequities” that remain across the education system and called for urgent action to support the children still left behind.Addressing an audience of education professionals and policy experts in Westminster, Spielman said: “There are still children who lag behind. Children for whom it seems the die is cast, even before entering nursery, and who never catch up in 12 years of schooling.”She highlighted the geographical differences in educational attainment across England. “A child in Hackney is more likely to fulfil their potential than ever before, but in some of our coastal towns and white working-class communities, attainment, progress and aspiration are too low.”While sink schools have disappeared from the educational map, she said some schools had not improved for more than a decade. The report revealed there were almost 500 “stuck” schools that had been judged inadequate or required improvement at every inspection since 2005. Turnaround rates for underperforming schools “remain too low”.According to Ofsted a lack of academy sponsors meant some schools were left in limbo for more than 18 months before joining a multi-academy trust. The report said the current “halfway house approach” to academisation was not working and called on the government to restore incentives that were originally put in place to encourage the best schools to become academies, so they could use their skills to sponsor and support weaker schools.“As long as children are attending schools that are perpetually less than good we have a problem,” said Spielman. “What makes the inequity even starker is that many of these schools are concentrated in particular parts of the country, serving the same demographic groups, often the white working class.”The chief inspector warned against searching for the latest gimmicks in the tech world to tackle the problems in education. It was, she said, about getting the basics right, beginning with early literacy.She said the phonics screening check had had a major impact on reading standards, but children on free school meals who reached the expected standards were 12 percentage points lower than wealthier classmates. There was also pronounced regional variation, with Newham and Newcastle ensuring good scores among their disadvantaged children, while more affluent areas such as West Berkshire lagged behind.“It shows we have a robust education system – one where parents can feel assured that the vast majority of schools, early years providers, children’s homes and local authorities provide a high level of education and care for young people, regardless of their circumstances.“One of the key functions of a good regulator is that it highlights areas of concern and we will work with Ofsted, schools, local authorities and others to address the issues this report picks out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7536adf76b6e7bfb5f29f69dace7270251bd40/0_207_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee8b1618176d55f5432e420a9d70ed7","title":"how do you spend your time when youre stuck at home in winter","story":"With long nights and wet weather we’d like to hear how you stop yourself from going stir-crazy when you’re stuck at homeFrom Almaty to Zagreb, from London (England) to London (Ontario), the days are getting colder, the nights are getting longer and the clouds are getting lower.How do you cope when you can’t face the gloom, the rain, the wind or the snow, yet have already spent far too many hours at home?

But more than 20,000 students around the world have now joined her. The school strikes have spread to at least 270 towns and cities in countries across the world, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the US and Japan.“For 25 years countless people have come to the UN climate conferences begging our world leaders to stop emissions and clearly that has not worked as emissions are continuing to rise. So I will not beg the world leaders to care for our future,” she said. “I will instead let them know change is coming whether they like it or not.”“Since our leaders are behaving like children, we will have to take the responsibility they should have taken long ago,” she said. “We have to understand what the older generation has dealt to us, what mess they have created that we have to clean up and live with. We have to make our voices heard.”The conference of nearly 200 nations is taking place in Katowice, Poland, and its main task is to turn the vision of tackling global warming agreed in Paris in 2015 into concrete action. On Monday, Sir David Attenborough told the summit that without action “the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon”.Thunberg, who had a meeting with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Monday, said: “What I hope we achieve at this conference is that we realise that we are facing an existential threat. This is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced. First we have to realise this and then as fast as possible do something to stop the emissions and try to save what we can save.”On Tuesday, Guterres said: “Our younger generations will have to help drive, and complete, the work we start today. We need to harness their energy, invention and political power to raise climate ambition.”Toby Thorpe, a school student from Hobart, Tasmania, who took part in the recent school strikes in Australia and is also at the UN summit, said: “We are in this together. Together we are strong and we will not give up.” Australia’s resources minister, Matt Canavan, had dismissed the school strike – “the best thing you’ll learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue” – but the Senate later approved a motion in support of the students.Thunberg said the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world was amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests was inspired by US school students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of school shootings. But initially her classmates refused to join in: “I had to do it alone.”She also had a message for other school students: “You don’t have to school strike, it’s your own choice. But why should we be studying for a future that soon may be no more? This is more important than school, I think.”Thunberg’s father, Svante, said: “As a parent you cannot support your child striking from school. I said to her you have to go out and do it for yourself.” But he added: “It’s OK in the holidays.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66d53e311c0626ea13f0f4811905a9615db91033/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8f2139f4d2c2132a28c1e2b544b841c","title":"oscars 2019 who should be the host","story":"The Academy is yet to announce who’ll take charge of next year’s ceremony, and with dwindling ratings, the time is ripe for a major changeIn response to the precipitous decline in viewership that followed a brief spike in 2014, when Ellen DeGeneres hosted, the Academy attempted earlier this year to redress those grievances by announcing it would trim its telecast to three hours, air it in February instead of March, and introduce a new category, Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film. The first two changes were greeted with consensus approval the second, however, with derision, since the implicit suggestion was that lucrative films aren’t good enough to simply be nominated for best picture, that something central distinguishes movies that perform at the box office from “high art”.Thankfully, after making a royal mess of its roll-out, the Academy scrapped the popular film award. And the likely presence at the ceremony of films like Black Panther, A Star is Born and Mary Poppins Returns will ensure it isn’t entirely starved of movies beloved by large, cinema-going swaths of the body politic. But perhaps these pre-emptive measures to stave off the Oscars’ impending obsolescence – neither the Golden Globes or even the Super Bowl, after all, are the monocultural events they used to be – are misguided. Could the Oscars be saved by simply picking a good host?The Academy announced in September 2017 that Jimmy Kimmel would be returning to host the 2018 awards, one year after he did his best to mitigate the chaos caused by Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway’s epic blunder (which, though unfortunate for the utterly deserving cast of Moonlight, illustrated the indispensability of spontaneous live-television snafus). But now it’s December and the Academy has still yet to announce a host for February’s ceremony, set to air on Kimmel’s home network, ABC.They could very well go for a hat-trick and give the job to the late-night host yet again, but that would be a rather safe and uncontroversial pick, which runs counter to the prevailing dogma that what the Academy needs is a jolt of energy, a kind of facelift. Ellen, one of the most admired and agreeable people in television, presided over the best-viewed Oscars telecast of the last decade, when the 2014 ceremony brought in almost 44 million viewers. But with the general currents pointing away from marquee event-television, it’s hard to say she’d provide the 2019 ceremony with an equivalent boost. So, in the spirit of the American pastime that is offering unsolicited opinions about the Oscars, some recommendations for the Academy as it presumably considers its 2019 master of ceremonies.The bright spot in last year’s otherwise exhaustive Oscars telecast was, of course, the comic duo of Tiffany Haddish and Maya Rudolph, who announced the awards for documentary and live-action short in an extended gag that skewered the ceremony’s overwhelming whiteness. The pair waltzed on to the stage at the Dolby Theatre with their high heels in hand, lampooning the sheer endlessness of awards season and supplying the ceremony with a much-needed trickle of self-mockery. Given Haddish’s meteoric ascent since her delightful turn in Girls Trip, and the duo’s undeniable comic camaraderie, they’d be an unassailable choice to host. The comments section below a YouTube clip of their 2018 appearance seems to bolster that assertion. “Please let them host next year,” reads the first. “I would actually watch it.”The last time the Academy chose two hosts was 2011, when its bet on an influx of energy from Young Hollywood in the form of Anne Hathaway and James Franco failed miserably. The pair were fundamentally and amusingly mismatched, their comic and temperamental sensibilities in diametric opposition. It made for an awkward evening. That would not be a problem were the Academy to go with Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, whose tongue-in-cheek rapport has worked to brilliant effect both live and on their sketch-comedy show Key \u0026amp Peele. That Peele took home the original screenplay award for Get Out in 2018 would lend the ceremony a sense of continuity, or perhaps a rush of new viewers, and remind them of his comic origins.Any highlight reel of the best awards show moments from years past would disproportionately feature comic-laureate Kirsten Wiig, whose gags at the 2013, 2015, and 2017 Golden Globes, alongside Will Ferrell, Bill Hader and Steve Carrell, respectively, were welcome departures from the monotony of Hollywood self-aggrandizement (not to mention Wiig and her Bridesmaid’s costars’ Martin Scorsese drinking game at the 2012 SAGs, a rare, improvisatory awards show triumph). Wiig’s comedy is sharp, goofy, playful and dexterous, which would fit the bill for a ceremony that asks a lot of its hosts, from opening monologues to live stunts to elaborate dance numbers. Just don’t make her sing, of course.Jon Stewart was in rare form at the 2008 Oscars, where his opening monologue was a hit, a refreshingly droll and appropriately scornful send-up of Hollywood pageantry. The Academy, then, would be well advised to assign hosting duties to his Daily Show successor Trevor Noah, who over the past two years has separated himself from the ever-growing pack of Trump satirists with comedy that’s at once earnest, erudite and screwballish. Noah is charming, too, and one wonders if the Oscars, often ridiculed as a kind of circle-jerk of limousine liberalism, should throw caution to the wind and lean into the low-hanging fruit that is anti-Trump comedy.On the heels of a wildly successful, Emmy-award winning Netflix special, and an opening monologue with Nick Kroll at the 2018 Spirit Awards that was perhaps the most lacerating rebuke of sexually abusive Hollywood heavyweights of last year’s awards season, John Mulaney would be a superb if risky choice to helm the 2019 ceremony. He would not exactly attract as many eyeballs as the aforementioned options, and he would certainly ruffle feathers, but Mulaney’s stock is rising and he would be a fitting choice for an awards body desperate to prove it isn’t out of touch with young folk, who make up a large contingent of Mulaney’s fanbase."},{"url":null,"title":"the 50 best films of 2018 in the uk","story":"Dogs, sea creatures and a coven of witches kick off this year’s countdown of monstrously good movies, updated every weekday.

I wanted to end with some words for young girls around the world: believe in yourselves.”Andy Murray was among those on social media who criticised Solveig’s comment, calling it “another example of the ridiculous sexism in sport.”“What questions did they ask Mbappé and Modric?” the British tennis player added on Instagram. “I’d imagine something to do with football. And to everyone who thinks I’m overreacting and it was just a joke ... it wasn’t. I’ve been involved in sport my whole life and the level of sexism is unreal.”Modric won a third straight Champions League title and inspired his country to reach the World Cup final, and there are few who will begrudge his victory, with Ronaldo in second. Lionel Messi only came fifth, finishing behind France duo Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappé – the first time since 2006 that the Argentina forward has not finished in the top three.There had been a clue that there would be a new winner in the 63rd edition of this award – Blackpool’s Stanley Matthews was the first in 1956 – when neither Ronaldo nor Messi were present at the Grand Palais in Paris, although in typically humble fashion Modric admitted he had been pleasantly surprised to be recognised after being congratulated on his victory by Croatia president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic.Having become the first teenager to score in a World Cup final since Pelé in 1958 as France won their second title in Russia, Paris Saint-Germain’s forward Mbappé was the runaway winner of the inaugural Kopa Trophy for the best player under the age of 21, ahead of Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold.

She talks about performing, her ‘four saints’, and why Beethoven is getting in the way of her sabbaticalTime is of the essence for Mitsuko Uchida, pianist supreme and one of the world’s most revered and loved musicians. This Japanese-born, Austrian-raised Londoner blocks her day around long periods of practice in her west London studio. A strict regime suits her need, in life and in music, for both monkish discipline and gregarious, unbuttoned, exhilarating freedom.Arriving early, I listen outside to a fabulous cascade of virtuosic pianism. This autumn she is touring a series of six Schubert sonatas, with two concerts at the Royal Festival Hall in December, the month in which she turns 70. On the dot, feeling like an intruder, I ring the bell. The music speeds up, rushes to the final chords and seconds later Uchida flings open the door. (Later I see my watch was fast. She was bang on time.)“I only have two pianos right now,” Uchida says, ushering me into the building where she works, wooden-floored and draped with sound-baffling hangings. “Two are away on tour. I don’t buy jewels or furs or antiques. Just pianos!” She has another, a baby grand, in her mews house opposite, where we retreat to talk.In the space of crossing the tiny courtyard and making tea – brown Japanese for her, first flush Darjeeling for me – with sharp attention to temperature and colour, she pronounces on Trump and Brexit (no fan of either), getting older (philosophical), sexism in music (she recognises it but hasn’t experienced it), ageism (ditto) and dark Belgian chocolate (she’s a dedicated consumer).The house, her home for over three decades, is simple and ordered. Her long-term partner, Robert Cooper, a retired diplomat, lives next door. While her aesthetic may be minimal, there’s nothing clinical about Uchida. Away from the piano, her manner is warm, prone to explosive laughter, her voice quiet and intense when debating an aspect of music.Has her attitude to work changed over the years? “How I’ve changed in myself is difficult to say. One thing is clear: I have always stayed a student. I’ve just got older.I’m basically someone who studies and who tries hard every day.”There’s no chance to take issue with this modest self-assessment. “There’s another constant in the past 20 years – my devotion to German music. The second Viennese school, but also Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert. Those are the four saints. I hope in the next few years I’ll start expanding my repertoire again. Back will come Chopin – as non-German as can be. And I’d love to branch out and play Janáček.”In this same “year off” she is also continuing with a five-year Mozart concerto series, playing and directing, with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra. “I can’t skip that …” And she remains artistic director of Marlboro Music, the US retreat for advanced professional musical training in Vermont.Uchida, born in the seaside town of Atami in 1948, left Japan when she was 12, for Austria, where her father was Japan’s ambassador. “I’m a European. That’s how I think of myself. Until I play in Tokyo and then I feel Japanese” She started playing the piano aged three and gave her first professional recital at 14. Two years later, when her family returned to Japan, she stayed on alone to study, soon winning the Vienna Beethoven prize and, in 1975, second prize in the Leeds Piano Competition.By then she had settled in London. “I’d been in Vienna for a long time. I wanted to get out and London was the place things seemed to be happening.” she says. “It was open in attitude. Now England is closing in.” During the 1980s and 1990s she recorded the Mozart piano concertos, conducted by the late Jeffrey Tate, and made a TV series with him. Not only was she glamorous in her various Issey Miyake tops , she was a female virtuoso who could talk, scintillatingly, about music: quite a novelty at the time. Mozart’s concertos have remained a mainstay.“No, no of course not! Mozart’s world is in the world of humans. The music came straight out of Wolfgang’s brains! The speed with which he worked is so different from that absolute, clearcut labour of Beethoven, who you can feel must have spent weeks, months, thinking and plotting. In Mozart it seems as if there was no premeditation.”Uchida has always dug deep into her chosen repertoire, preferring not to mix different composers’ sound worlds at any one time. There’s a purity in her approach, which extends to the limpid precision of her playing. “Now it’s Schubert. Dear Schubert, an unimaginable genius, living a life of such abject loneliness.”Her London concerts pair Schubert’s middle A minor (D784) sonata with the big, late A major (D959). “I never thought putting those two into the same programme was going to reveal such unbelievable tragedy, clashing in different ways.” These are the kind of discoveries she still makes with works she’s played all her career.“I am not an obsessive performer. My absolute maximum number of concerts is 55 a year. That’s tiny compared to most, who play at least 100, even as many as 140. That’s madness for me. I couldn’t handle it. I remember Elena Bashkirova, Daniel Barenboim’s wife, saying that for Daniel, a day without a concert is punishment. For me, a day without a concert means I can breathe freely.”The clock on the table has moved past the allotted hour. We speed up. Can she enjoy concerts?“Yes, absolutely. And I can listen to music too, without feeling under pressure that I ought to be working.”What about that moment when she walks on to the platform?“That’s the moment of truth. All the rest is pretending. That’s why you have to perform. You work differently. You learn different things. You have to risk your life on stage. That’s why live performances are more interesting.”Is it possible to avoid risks? “Yes, but the more you know, the harder it is to perform. The risks become so dangerous. I used to think it would grow easier as I got older and wiser, but I can swear it hasn’t. Maybe because I’m not wiser … ”Uchida’s slight frame rocks with laughter. “One thing hasn’t changed. Every day of my life that I am allowed to play Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and the music of our own time too, especially that of my beloved friend, György Kurtág – this, to me, is a gift from somewhere. If heaven existed, it’s heaven.”• Mitsuko Uchida is at the Royal Festival Hall, London on 4 and 7 December, and with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra on 6 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/909ed19610b6b4fa645e57ef8027363ef17dd8ab/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90237ba1b83c5e0a94a89398e554788f","title":"honduras a dam and the of berta caceres","story":"Seven men have been convicted of the murder of an award-winning environmental activist in Honduras.

As a result both broadcasters are now officially insisting they are continuing with preparations for their own rival debates in five days’ time, with no idea which leaders – if any – will turn up to their event.However, there is the possibility of a breakthrough on Tuesday as negotiations continue.Discussions began last week, when Theresa May issued a challenge to the Labour leader, urging him to come on national television and debate her Brexit deal with the European Union – an offer that Corbyn’s team immediately accepted. Rival broadcasters then began bidding against each for the right to host the programme on their channel, with proposals for slightly different formats.ITV suggested a simple head-to-head format on Sunday evening, hosted by Julie Etchingham and with no studio audience. Labour swiftly let it be known that they preferred this format and were ready to sign up with the commercial broadcaster, because it will maximise the amount of direct discussion between the two party leaders.The BBC proposed a different format, featuring opening statements from both leaders but also including a panel of experts and representatives of smaller political parties who both support and oppose Theresa May’s Brexit deal. Downing Street strongly prefers this option and insist this is the only debate that they are willing to take part in.As a result both political parties are now claiming that they have fulfilled the terms of the original challenge and it is up to the rival party to blink first and accept the other’s favoured debate format.The broadcasters are also standing firm and pushing ahead with preparations.“ITV have invited the prime minister and leader of the opposition to appear in an ITV programme this Sunday evening,” the commercial broadcaster said in a statement on Monday night. “Invitations remain open. As always, it is up to those invited to decide whether they want to accept the invitation.”The BBC, in its most recent comment on the issue, defended its proposed format: “Our proposal is to broadcast a programme which includes both a head-to-head debate between the prime minister and the leader of the opposition and also an opportunity to hear from a wider range of voices.”It is unclear whether either broadcaster would be willing to publicly empty-chair either May or Corbyn if they fail to turn up, given the highly unusual situation.On Saturday David Cameron’s former director of communications Craig Oliver, who was involved in organising the 2015 general election debates, suggested the debate over the debate was “displacement activity” which distracted from the real issue of the looming parliamentary vote on the deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bc1e1e0b9f8827f891b67c9ce81f5f07078436a/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb1edee71d3d8f5e60b0173ea38e20b","title":"uk can stop article 50 without eu approval top ecj adviser says","story":"European court of justice likely to endorse opinion in case taken by anti-Brexit campaignersThe UK can unilaterally abandon the article 50 process, a senior adviser to the European court of justice (ECJ) has said, in a significant boost to anti-Brexit campaigners.Campos Sánchez-Bordona, the court’s advocate general, said he believed EU law allowed a country to revoke article 50 – the provision of the Lisbon treaty invoked by the UK to give two years’ notice that it intended to leave the union – without requiring the formal agreement of the European commission or other EU member states.In his formal opinion, Sánchez-Bordona said it was essential MPs knew they could stop the Brexit process, dismissing the UK government’s claims the issue was hypothetical.The UK government and European commission had insisted the Brexit process could be stopped only by unanimous agreement, even though EU treaties were silent on how an article 50 application could be withdrawn.Sánchez-Bordona’s opinion is a major boost for a cross-party group of Scottish parliamentarians, led by the Scottish Green party MSP Andy Wightman. They launched their legal action in December last year.With time running out before Brexit day on 29 March, the court is expected to issue an emergency ruling on the case within weeks, perhaps before Christmas, but probably not until after MPs vote on the withdrawal agreement brokered by Theresa May on 11 December.If the court endorses the advocate general’s opinion, the case will be referred back to the court of session in Edinburgh for a final decision.Wightman said he welcomed the advocate general’s ruling but warned that it would need a second EU referendum before article 50 could be revoked by the UK. That would take months to arrange, which would mean the current article 50 process would need to be extended.“It is now highly likely that, if the people of the UK were to change their minds and decide to remain in the EU, there is now a route to doing so,” he said. A second vote was, he said, “the only option that ends the current chaos and provides a considered and sincere means by which the citizens of the UK can have the final say in this process”.The Scottish National party MEP Alyn Smith, involved in the legal action, said the opinion confirmed their long-held view that Westminster could “stop the clock” on Brexit.“We now have a roadmap out of the Brexit shambles, a bright light has switched on above an ‘exit’ sign and the false choice being offered to MPs at Westminster – that it is Mrs May’s disastrous deal or chaos – is shown for what it is, an abuse of parliament,” he said.The UK government had fought strenuously to prevent the case reaching the European court, tabling a last-minute appeal with the UK supreme court only days before the hearing in Luxembourg. The appeal was rejected.After a series of hearings at the court of session in Edinburgh, the court of justice held an emergency hearing in Luxembourg late last month, taking the rare step of convening all 28 judges.While the opinion from Sánchez-Bordona is not binding on the judges, it would be unusual for the ECJ to reach a decision that contradicts the advice of an advocate general.In the opinion released on Tuesday morning by the ECJ, Sánchez-Bordona rejected the UK government’s argument that the issue of whether article 50 could be unilaterally revoked was hypothetical.Lord Keen, the UK’s Scottish law adviser, had told the ECJ the UK government had no intention of abandoning Brexit under any circumstances, making the question inadmissible.The court of justice said Sánchez-Bordona disagreed. “According to the advocate general, the dispute is genuine, the question is not merely academic, nor premature or superfluous, but has obvious practical importance and is essential in order to resolve the dispute,” the court said.It added that he believed an article 50 process should be handled in the same way as any other international treaty: if a party wished to withdraw from it, it was able to do so unilaterally because it was a sovereign state.The case was initially launched by two Scottish Green party MSPs, Wightman and Ross Greer the Scottish National party MP Joanna Cherry QC Smith, the SNP MEP the Scottish Labour MEP David Martin and the Scottish Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine. The Labour MP Chris Leslie and the Lib Dem MP Tom Brake later joined it as additional parties.Jolyon Maugham QC, a lawyer and anti-Brexit campaigner whose Good Law Project funded the legal action, said the advocate general’s opinion “puts the decision about our future back into the hands of our own elected representatives, where it belongs … I’m sure MPs will now search their consciences and act in the best interests of the country.”One of the architects of article 50, Lord Kerr, also welcomed the opinion.“This is no surprise and, if the court agrees, will confirm that it is still up to us to decide whether we want to keep the existing deal we’ve got in the EU rather than leave on the government’s terms,” he said. “Despite some of the bogus claims that have been made by those who oppose staying in the EU, there would be no price to pay – political or financial – if we were to take back the article 50 letter.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aa4932b08408fb2705a2e3e8bd20e9874337fb7/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e742d243fd1cca2b215d3139b4453d8a","title":"what happens next if theresa mays brexit deal is voted down","story":"We examine the possible scenarios, from a snap election to a second referendumAfter taking her Brexit deal on a round-Britain roadshow last week, Theresa May is spending much of the next few days holding face-to-face meetings with her MPs in an attempt to persuade them to support it in the meaningful vote on 11 December.But with the parliamentary arithmetic looking bleak, just about everyone in Westminster is busy looking beyond next Tuesday – and puzzling over what will happen next.If the deal is voted down as anticipated, there are at least seven possible scenarios:While no one in Downing Street wants to countenance it openly, the EU Withdrawal Act – as amended by MPs – gives Theresa May up to 21 days to return to parliament and set out what she plans to do next.She could come back to parliament and say she will seek to renegotiate the backstop – though No 10 insists that would be impossible – or even pivot towards a different kind of Brexit, perhaps with a permanent customs union as Labour is calling for.May could also ask for an extension to article 50, the strictly time-limited EU exit procedure, in order to allow her to renegotiate, though that would require the consent of all 27 other EU member states.Rumours have been swirling around Westminster for several weeks now, suggesting Downing Street could choose to take a dramatic gamble and appeal to the public, over the heads of squabbling MPs, to back the prime minister’s deal.Of course, it did not go too well the last time she asked voters to give her a fresh Brexit mandate, last year, but internal polling suggests there is considerable personal sympathy for the embattled prime minister. If she won, she could press ahead with her deal.Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, she would need a two-thirds majority to trigger a general election, but last year’s experience suggested that is not an insurmountable barrier – and Labour is champing at the bit.Parliament must be dissolved at least 25 working days before a general election can be held, so any election would probably take place in late January.The prime minister has been so intimately associated with the shape of this Brexit deal, with its focus on controlling migration and extricating Britain from the scope of the European court of justice, that a heavy defeat could fatally undermine her already dented authority.Particularly if the defeat is a hefty one, she may decide she cannot be the person to make the next move – or her cabinet may decide for her.The Conservatives would then need to hold a hasty leadership contest, the outcome of which could have a profound impact on the shape of Brexit.If May opts to try to cling to office after a thumping defeat in the meaningful vote – and her cabinet does not show her the door by threatening to resign en masse – she could face a vote of no confidence in her leadership.The European Research Group of Brexiters failed to muster the 48 names necessary to trigger such a vote last month, but following a defeat, particularly if May appears unwilling to change course, many more could decide to join them.Losing the vote would prompt a leadership contest, in which May could not stand, and her successor would face the job of resurrecting Brexit with the 29 March deadline fast approaching.Labour’s priority is to try to secure a general election, to allow Jeremy Corbyn to take over and send Sir Keir Starmer to negotiate with Brussels.In the days following the vote, Labour could table a vote of no confidence in the government. May could still win it, but not without the support of the DUP, which is deeply dissatisfied with her approach to Brexit.If the government loses, Corbyn would have a fortnight in which to try to assemble a viable governing majority, by teaming up with other parties. If he was unable to do so – which would appear likely – a general election would be called.Another outlandish possibility being mooted by some at Westminster is that a time-limited, cross-party “government of national unity” could emerge at this point, perhaps around the idea of a Norway-style Brexit.Dominic Grieve and his allies have fought to ensure that whichever motion is brought back to parliament by the government, once the vote has failed, can be amended.In theory at least, that could allow MPs to test the backing of MPs for a menu of different options, including a harder or a softer Brexit.Even if a majority emerged for an alternative approach, it is unclear whether such a motion would be formally binding on the government. But proponents of this approach argue that it would have political bite, as a statement of the collective will of the House of Commons.Rebel MPs who support a “people’s vote” are determined to try to use any parliamentary tactics they can to force the government to take its Brexit deal to the public in another referendum.Crucially, while several on the Labour frontbench remain deeply sceptical about the idea, its membership is overwhelmingly in favour of overturning Brexit, and leading figures including the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have begun to make warmer noises about it.It remains unclear whether there is time for a referendum to be held before the March deadline and an extension of article 50 would probably be necessary.But if parliament appears deadlocked, passing the question back to the public could look increasingly appealing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8fc26ef9e5699c05c36ee205235a2e65816d377/0_90_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02af2277c53cd9909609dda8c300744c","title":"physicist albert einstein god letter reflecting on religion up for auction christies","story":"Missive that calls the Bible ‘a collection of primitive legends’ is expected to fetch up to $1.5mA handwritten missive by Albert Einstein known as the “God letter” is expected to fetch up to $1.5m (£1.2m) when it goes under the hammer.The one-and-a-half-page letter, written in 1954 in German and addressed to the philosopher Eric Gutkind, contains reflections on God, the Bible and Judaism.Einstein says: “The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive, legends which are nevertheless pretty childish.”The sentence has been hailed as evidence that the physicist, one of the 20th century’s most esteemed thinkers, was an atheist. But Einstein at times said he was not an atheist, and resented being labelled as one.In the letter – being auctioned at Christie’s in New York on Tuesday – Einstein, a Jew, also articulates his disenchantment with Judaism. “For me the Jewish religion like all others is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people,” he wrote.“As far as my experience goes, they are no better than other human groups, although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power. Otherwise I cannot see anything ‘chosen’ about them.”The letter was written in response to a book by Gutkind, called Choose Life: The Biblical Call to Revolt.The letter had been held among Gutkin’s papers, but it came up for auction in London in 2008. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins was beaten in bidding that ended at £170,000.Acknowledging his disappointment in failing to secure the item, Dawkins said: “This letter was about something very important to Einstein I suspect.”According to Einstein: A Life, a biography published in 1996, he was devoutly religious as a child. But at the age of 13, he “abandoned his uncritical religious fervour, feeling he had been deceived into believing lies”.He said he believed in “Spinoza’s God” – referring to Baruch Spinoza, a 17th-century Dutch thinker – “who reveals himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind”.On another occasion, he criticised “fanatical atheists whose intolerance is of the same kind as the intolerance of the religious fanatics”.Nick Spencer, a senior fellow at the Christian thinktank Theos, said: “Einstein offers scant consolation to either party in this debate. His cosmic religion and distant deistic God fits neither the agenda of religious believers or that of tribal atheists.“As so often during his life, he refused and disturbed the accepted categories. We do the great physicist a disservice when we go to him to legitimise our belief in God, or in his absence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d80a8142dea6d88a97a5a83eb5058fde03c5282b/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e8054f2148bd6b3c65b74d7f6ea64fb","title":"tough as old boots a thames skeletons durable footwear tideway tunnel","story":"Archaeologists say man who died 500 years ago may have been a mudlark or fishermanHe was found lying on his front, head twisted to the side. One arm was bent above his head, suggesting he had fallen – or perhaps had been pushed – to his death in the river more than five centuries ago.But aside from his puzzling position, the skeleton discovered this year near the shore of the Thames in London was notable for another, very particular reason. Though his clothes had long since decayed, on the man’s feet were a pair of remarkably well preserved – and extremely rare – knee-high leather boots. Might they hold clues, archaeologists wondered, to who the man was and, just possibly, how he died?The mystery of the man in the medieval wellies was uncovered in Bermondsey by archaeologists working on the Thames Tideway tunnel, the so-called “super-sewer” currently being built to update the capital’s Victorian sewage network.It’s not unusual to find bodies on the foreshore, but the style and preservation of the man’s footwear, made of leather “quarters” stitched together with waxed flax thread, is exceptional, say archaeologists.“Leather can be very well preserved in London, especially if it’s found in a ditch that would have been full of water, or near the riverfront,” said Beth Richardson, a finds specialist for the archaeological team from Mola Headland Infrastructure. In the absence of any metalwork or other dating evidence, the style of the boots – unheeled, with a single, flat sole reinforced with “clump soles” at the front and back – dated the skeleton to the late 1400s or early 1500s at the latest.The fact that they reach the knee makes it likely the boots were waders, experts think, making it possible the man worked in or around the river as a dock worker, mudlark or fisherman. Mariners of the time were known to wear long boots, according to Richardson, as evidenced by the large number found on the wreck of the Tudor warship the Mary Rose.And like their modern-day welly-boot equivalent, they are nothing fancy. “These were very simple boots,” says Richardson. They are not fashionable at all, they haven’t got buckles or anything like that – they are just practical, everyday boots.” Conservation work to preserve the leather is still ongoing, and there is no immediate plan to put the boots on display.Plant matter found inside the boots is yet to be analysed, but the archaeologists suspect it was a lining of moss that had been added to keep the man’s feet warm as he waded.Even without his distinctive footwear, however, there are clues to his identity. Evidence of extensive degenerative joint disease along his spine and left hip joint show he lived a physical life and would have suffered pain every day, according to Niamh Carty, an osteologist. Though she could not rule out that he was younger than 35, she believes he was probably much older.In addition, the man has distinctive grooves in his teeth, “a possible indication of pulling some sort of material over the biting surface of the teeth or holding an object in the teeth for prolonged periods of time,” said Carty. One possibility is that he was pulling rope between his teeth, as a fisherman might.As for how the man came to die, we will never know for sure, but there is no evidence of foul play, according to the archaeologists.“He may have been working in the river and the tide got too much for him, he may have fallen over, he may have been tired,” Richardson said. “He may have had too much to drink. We really don’t know.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3be2552798e78fbc44122e1a889ccce6426d317d/0_299_5214_3129/master/5214.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bf8aca3e1cb65bdb454bb3c2f5e7036","title":"georgia hall paid womens tour men golf interview","story":"Georgia Hall had her breakthrough victory by claiming the British Open in August and now for the first time in her career can approach a new year without any financial concerns“World No 1 is my next big thing,” Georgia Hall says casually as she reflects on her breakthrough in 2018 and sets her targets for the new year as one of the best women golfers on the planet. At the start of this year Hall had never won an LPGA tournament as a professional. She ends it having celebrated the fact her first victory in Europe happened to be a major, when she won the British Open in August, and that she has broken into the world’s top 10.The 22-year-old from Bournemouth had to struggle to reach this point because, as the daughter of a plasterer, she did not always have the money to play in tournaments for which she had already qualified. Her life is much easier now, as she received a winner’s cheque of £375,000 after winning the Open at Royal Lytham, and the clarity of Hall’s ambition is soon apparent.Hall responds emphatically when asked if she would prefer to become the world’s best golfer before winning another major. “Yeah, I’d take world No 1 for sure. That’s the dream.”Her victory was made more special because her father, Wayne, was her caddie for the week. A golf nut who had named her Georgia in honour of Nick Faldo’s victory in the Masters at Augusta shortly before her birth in April 1996, Wayne Hall takes over from Tyrrell at every Open. “He’s always done the British and the Scottish Open. Harry doesn’t mind stepping down those two weeks. He knows it’s a big thing for my dad.”On the Sunday afternoon Hall trailed Thailand’s Pornanong Phatlum by a single shot. They were pitted against each other in the last pairing, which became a compelling shootout. Hall’s final round of 67 sealed her victory by two shots from Phatlum. “I was in a perfect position,” Hall suggests, “because I kept saying: ‘Why am I nervous? Someone else must be more nervous because she’s leading. So, Georgia, calm down.’ It helped that Pornanong smiles a lot and we both settled down to play well. I was very calm.“It was far harder on the Saturday front nine. I was the most nervous I’ve ever been but I holed eight big putts in six holes – most were 25-footers. After that I thought: ‘This is my tournament now.’ I was trying to control my emotions all week. I knew if I got caught up in the atmosphere I would have lost the tournament. My dad was very nervous but we didn’t say one word about winning. We just talked about the next shot, which I liked.”Her dad wore the same pair of socks every day as, after the first of four successive sub-70 rounds, he did not want to change her luck. “I didn’t know that until the last day,” Hall says, wrinkling her nose. “On our way to the club he said: ‘I’ve been wearing the same socks every day, by the way. I was going to change them but you played so well the first day I didn’t.’ Hopefully he’s washed them by now.”There was a deeper family backdrop. “My grandad was really ill and I probably wouldn’t have won without playing for him. Every time I hit a bad shot or got too excited, I would think: ‘Come on, do it for grandad.’ He passed away two weeks later but I’m glad he kind of witnessed it. I phoned him up later on in the day and he was so happy I won.”Her victory came after 15 years of hard work amid challenging financial circumstances. “My dad was a plasterer and my mum a hairdresser. He played golf and took me down to the local driving range when I was seven. I then joined the kids’ club and I was the only girl. There were seven levels, and I got to the top level quickly. I was beating all the boys and they used to hate that. They were quite embarrassed.“I did cross-country and football and I was in the boys’ cricket team. I was the only girl. I was a pretty good batsman because I would swing my bat like a golf club. I used to really whack it. I didn’t know it at the time but it was tough for my parents. They didn’t tell me this until a few years ago. But they always had to sell some things for me to have enough money for golf lessons and tournaments. We lived quite far down south and so dad would drive me for four hours to get to a two-hour lesson and then drive me back – on top of working.“Golf is one of the most expensive sports you can play. You need to pay a lot to join a club, you need golf clubs, all the equipment, lessons. It was hard and I missed three majors I’d qualified for because of a lack of funds. I was in the top three in the world as an amateur but we couldn’t afford to get to me there. I could only get to the British Open. That was frustrating but I always said I will be fine in the end.”Francesco Molinari, who won the 2018 Open, received a cheque for £1.42m which meant he earned £1,045,000 more than Hall. “We’re paid very well on the women’s tour, but we can’t do anything about that big difference. We work just as hard as the men and we’re very good. If you watch an LPGA tournament the standard is incredible. But the men earn so much more.”Tennis is different as women receive the same amount of prize money as the men for winning the grand slams. “Yeah, it’s happened already in tennis even though they’re playing less. Maybe they should play the same number of sets and get paid the same money. We’re playing the same amount of holes as the men.”Hall is taking a break after such a busy year. “I’m going to Barbados. I hope I don’t get bored because the last time I had a holiday I was six years old. We went to Spain for two weeks. So this one feels overdue. I’m purposely flying home first to drop my clubs off to make sure I don’t play on holiday. I have to make sure I don’t hit a ball otherwise my mind won’t be fresh next year.”Does she still play against Harry – who had been hoping to become a professional? “Not for a while,” Hall says, “but he can still hit a golf ball. He’s decent.”Hall smiles when I ask who has won the most over their years of golfing rivalry. “Oh, me. Harry’s won about four times.” Tyrrell shakes his head. “A long time ago.” Does he plan to try to play against a woman who aims to become world No 1? “No,” he says with a grin, “it’s too much.”Hall nods intently. “I’m just very competitive at everything. I just want to win, all the time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004b6f45ca3314f330db59d233582acb52239679/0_134_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dddbf9a18cd862283f04bf3b2c27b3a5","title":"talking horses can teruntum star bag the big prize at lingfield","story":"Lingfield hosts arguably the most interesting and competitive race of the day as the jumps season hits its strideThe jumps season has now hit full stride with a succession of big weekend races stretching off into the new year, but all-weather racing has a significant role to play in the midweek action and this afternoon’s cards are a case in point. Lingfield has £15,000 more prize money on offer than either of the National Hunt cards, seven of the eight races currently have a favourite at 11-4 or bigger, and it also has what is arguably the most interesting and competitive race of the day at 2.20 as nine sprint handicappers chase a £12,600 first prize. Dyed-in-the-tweed jumping fans may disagree, but the fact of it is that all nine runners in this race have a snippet of form somewhere that gives them at least an outside chance, including Cox Bazar, who makes his British debut for Ivan Furtado but managed to beat four of his 15 opponents to the line in the Group One Prix de l’Abbaye at Longchamp in October.Gracious John has registered a win over course and distance in the first fortnight of December for the last two years, including a victory off 107 in 2016 that makes his current mark of 103 look very appealing. At the likely prices, though, the value may lie with the 10-1 chance Teruntum Star (2.20), who will be making only his third start on an all-weather surface. Kevin Ryan’s six-year-old can be a little inconsistent but is very capable at his best and was within a length of registering his first win for more than a year at Nottingham last time. He should get a strong pace to chase today and he is now 1lb below his last winning mark. He also had Gracious John – who was running off his lower turf mark – just over a length behind him at Nottingham, and he is 7lb better off with that opponent today.The return to an all-weather surface brought the best out of Madrinho (1.20) at Kempton last time and he will go close on the same card if he is anywhere near that form. Confrerie (12.20) and Wotadoll (12.50) are two more with big chances at Lingfield, while Oologist (3.00) and Wisecracker (2.40) are two to look out for on the jumps cards at Southwell and Fakenham respectively.

First-round defeats in the International Open and Professional Players Championship showed his struggles on the green baize and his domestic situation was tumultuous to say the least. He had spent some time in a mental health hospital after he overdosed on sleeping tablets while on holiday in Majorca and, now separated from his wife Lynn, his life seemed to be spinning out of control.Higgins had reached the final of the UK Championship the previous season but, judging by his form, the chances of a repeat in November 1983 seemed slim. Although, predicting anything with the Hurricane was never straightforward. Going into the tournament he said he was practising for 10 hours a day, so perhaps he could make his mark at the Guild Hall in Preston. Higgins had already won the World Championship in 1972 and 1982, as well as the Masters in 1978 and 1981, so a victory in the UK Championship would make him just the third player – after Steve Davis and Terry Griffiths – to win snooker’s triple crown.He had the motivation and the pedigree but Higgins began the tournament terribly, with another early exit looking a distinct possibility when he lost the first four frames of his first-round match to Murdo MacLeod. Yet a fine comeback resulted in a 9-6 win and, as the tournament progressed, Higgins began to gain momentum. A 9-1 win over Paul Medati and a 9-5 victory against Tony Knowles set up a semi-final meeting with Griffiths.Higgins announced that he was back with his wife during the Griffiths match and his improved mental state was reflected in his impressive 9-4 win. He played a rock-steady safety game when needed and then turned on the flair to capitalise on Griffiths’ errors. Having lost two previous UK Championship finals, Higgins was now hoping it would be third time lucky.Inevitably, he would face Davis in the final. The reigning world champion had little trouble in Preston, losing just 12 frames in four matches as he brushed aside Geoff Foulds, Willie Thorne, Tony Meo and Jimmy White. Although Davis knew that a focused Higgins would be a different proposition. “If he plays as well as he has been, I shall have to step up a gear,” said Davis.The early exchanges of the final suggested the Higgins juggernaut was coming to a juddering halt. In what looked like becoming a huge anti-climax, Davis flew out of the traps and took all seven frames in the first session on the Saturday. With sponsors Coral quoting odds of 161 for Higgins to win the best-of-31 final, the Hurricane was in need of inspiration. Golfer Andrew “Chubby” Chandler, one of his close friends, came to the rescue after that disastrous first session. “I made sure he went back to the hotel, that he had a meal and that we talked about everything under the sun except snooker,” said Chandler. “I think he now realises which approach is more beneficial. I can’t tell him how to win snooker matches in terms of skill, but I do understand the mental process.”Higgins returned to the table a changed man. Winning the opening three frames of the evening session was the ideal riposte and, although Davis won the next, Higgins took the last four frames on the Saturday to leave the final in the balance with Davis 8-7 in front. The final everyone had hoped for was now a reality. Davis was rattled, as he later admitted. “When I was leading 7-0 I was flying, but he changed his mood and was trying desperately to get back into the game. I never really recovered once he did.”Higgins continued his fine run on the Sunday, winning the opening frame to level the match at 8-8 as the final slowly developed into an epic. The match swayed one way and then the other as Davis took a couple of frames and then Higgins pinned him back. With just the Sunday evening session to play, they were tied on 11-11.The two great snooker heavyweights continued to trade blows in the final session as the the 1,200 sell-out crowd and BBC audience at home remained on the edge of their seats. Remarkably, Higgins took the lead for the first time when he closed out the 23rd frame. When he hit a break of 86 in the 26th – the highest in the final – Higgins was 14-12 up and on the brink of a miracle.A lot of players may well have drowned as the relentless Higgins wave crashed towards them, but Davis was no ordinary mortal. The reigning world champion won the next three frames on the bounce to put himself one up with two to play. Higgins was on the ropes once again.Digging deep, Higgins sent the match into a deciding frame, before completing “the greatest escape act snooker has seen” to quote David Emery of the Express. Taking the clinching frame 77-0, Higgins was immediately congratulated by plenty of well-wishers. “It was very important to me to beat Steve to show the public how good I am,” he said afterwards. “The outcome is a very happy ending. I owe much to my good lady for the help and encouragement she gave me.”Davis tried his best to put on a brave face but struggled to hide his disappointment. “I enjoyed it as a game,” he said. “It was good for snooker. The only person it wasn’t good for was me.” Understandably, the defeat hit him hard. “I remember looking across at Steve during the presentation and thinking he looked like a little boy lost,” Higgins wrote in his autobiography, From the Eye of the Hurricane.Everything slotted into place perfectly for Higgins. “This is the best week of my life,” he said as he stood with his wife. “We’re back together, it’s my daughter’s birthday and I’m the UK champion. What can beat that?”It could have been the start of something big but, as Higgins recounted in his autobiography, his triumph at the UK Championship was in fact the beginning of the end. “I knew I had triumphed in one of the greatest comebacks in snooker history. I was back on top and nothing was going to get in my way. How wrong I was.” Sadly, it wouldn’t be too long before his career and marriage were both beyond repair.But that was in the future. Higgins’ performance in that 1983 final deserves to be celebrated in isolation, a frightening achievement considering the man he was up against. “It’s one of the most enthralling finals ever,” Higgins said that Sunday night. “Everybody saw two master craftsman at work.”Spare a thought, though, for Bill Martin of Millwall. Staking his life’s savings on a Davis win at 46, Martin must have been counting his winnings after the first session of that final. But you had to expect the unexpected when dealing with the Hurricane.• This article appeared first on That 1980s Sports Blog• Follow Steven Pye on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64d47e7588a4414888f26faae8809518245196a9/58_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed3a3c2309359e47f300721197e8c9aa","title":"forbes seven year old youtuber ryan toys review made 17m in one year","story":"US toy reviewer Ryan beats UK’s Daniel Middleton to the top spot for highest earningsA seven-year-old American boy who reviews toys has topped a list of the highest-earning YouTube stars after making £17.3m in a year.Ryan, from Ryan ToysReview, made the sum for his online reviews between June 2017 and June 2018.

But is this the new Mac laptop for most people or has it lost some of the desirability and shine while stagnating since 2015?When closed, the new MacBook Air looks pretty much the same as the old one. The aluminium frame is still wedge-shaped. It still has the cut-out in the deck to lift the screen and still has the Apple logo emblazoned on the lid, even if it is now metallic and shiny rather than being light-up opaque plastic.But side by side it is clear this is a smaller, more modern Mac shrunk in both width and length, but not in height, fitting exactly into the footprint of the current 13in MacBook Pro. Gone, too, are the old selection of ports from the Air, reduced to only two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports and one headphone socket. USB-C is the industry standard port of the moment, with Thunderbolt 3 adding much greater capacity and future proofing, but the lack of an SD card reader is disappointing.Open it up and essentially what you are looking at is the screen and deck of a MacBook Pro without Touch Bar. Gone are the large grey bezels around the 13.3in screen from the Air, replaced with thinner black borders as used on other Apple laptops.The MacBook Air has Apple’s third-generation butterfly keyboard, a large force-touch trackpad and speakers drilled into either side. In the top right is the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, which is noticeably faster than Apple’s previous iterations, but instead of a Touch Bar you have regular F keys. While the Touch Bar can be useful, many don’t like it and most will probably be happy the MacBook Air does not have it.Some will love the keyboard, some will hate it because it is still pretty clicky with minimal key travel. It isn’t my favourite keyboard on a laptop but it is crisp and responsive and I have no problem typing for long periods of time on it. Everyone should love the trackpad, however, which is the best in the business. It is big, smooth, responsive and totally solid, despite the feeling of motion when you push down on it provided by the Taptic Engine haptic motor below it.Build quality is top notch, with no noticeable give or flex in any part of the machine. Weighing 1.25kg, the Air is about the same as rivals such as Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 2 and is slim enough that you don’t really notice it in a backpack. But it is noticeably heavier than the 921g 12in MacBook or 770g Surface Pro 6 (1.08kg with keyboard attached). At its thickest part it is also 0.7mm thicker than the MacBook Pro.The MacBook Air as tested had 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.The MacBook Air has a relatively unusual mix of hardware for 2018. It only has one choice of processor, an eighth-generation Intel Core i5 processor, but it isn’t the same quad-core U-series processor available in the 13in MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, instead it is a dual-core Y-series chip.While the fine points of processor names are probably lost on most Mac buyers, Y-series chips are lower power in performance and energy consumption than their U-series siblings. For the MacBook Air, Apple has mixed things up a little – most computers that use Y-series chips are fanless, but the MacBook Air has a small fan, which means it should maintain performance for longer by better dissipating heat. Not that I ever heard the fan in day-to-day use, unlike the old MacBook Air.Performance is very similarly to a dual-core 2017 MacBook Pro, falling down only in intensive multiprocess tasks, where both laptops are far behind the 2018 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar partly because it has a quad-core processor.With a fast SSD and RAM, therefore, the MacBook Air feels snappy in all tasks and will easily handle most day-to-day activities. It was a pleasure to use. Only if you attempt to do something graphically or arithmetically challenging, such as attempting to play the latest game, edit multiple 4K videos or mine cryptocurrency, will you find the MacBook Air struggles.The MacBook Air is capable of seeing out a work day without having to be plugged in, lasting about nine hours between charges. That was with the brightness set about two-thirds, 20 or so tabs open in Chrome, iA Writer, Reeder and various chat apps in constant use, while listing to Spotify over Bluetooth headphones for four hours. More conservative use should mean about 10 hours of productivity but it won’t come close to the 14 or so hours some managed to squeeze out of the previous MacBook Air.MacOS hasn’t radically changed in years, iterating small elements of the interface with each update, while improving the performance of the underlying system. Now at version 10.14 Mojave, the biggest visual change is the introduction of a dark mode to the interface, which is meant to be for concentrating at night or similar, but I found it a nice change and left it on all the time.Mojave also brought some of Apple’s iOS apps to the Mac, including Apple News and Voice Memos. For the most part you cannot tell that the app is a port of sorts of an iOS app. The Apple News app works more or less as any regular Mac app would, but with fewer features and options than you might be used to on macOS, and the same goes for Voice Memos, which syncs with the Voice Memos app on iOS.MacOS is a mature and stable operating system that anyone who has used Windows 10 or most versions of Linux will be able to adjust to relatively easily.The Apple MacBook Air is available in silver, space grey and gold costing £1,199 with a dual-core Intel Core i5 Y-series processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or £1,399 with 256GB of storage.Options are available with up to 16GB of RAM for an extra £180, 512GB of storage for £400 and 1.5TB of storage for £1,200, reaching a maximum price of £2,579.In many ways the original MacBook Air became the default Mac for most people. It was a highly capable machine that didn’t cost the earth (for an Apple product).The new MacBook Air lives up to most of the standards set by its predecessor. It is highly capable machine that will handle the majority of what most people need to get done. It’s not an exciting or ground-breaking computer but it is the new workhorse for all those who don’t need serious graphical or processing performance but must use a Mac.However, since the last version of the MacBook Air launched in 2015, competition in the sub-£1,300 premium laptop category has increased dramatically. With strong options from Dell, Microsoft and many others that are often cheaper and more powerful than the new MacBook Air, if you aren’t tied into MacOS there are arguably better options.For those Apple buyers who have been lost in the gap between the tiny 12in MacBook and the costly 13in MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the new MacBook Air delivers. In fact, I would say the MacBook Air is the new default Mac – and not only because it’s the cheapest. It is arguably the most balanced and, therefore, best Apple laptop currently available.Cons: expensive, no SD card reader, only two USB-CThunderbolt 3 ports, only a 30W charger in the box, butterfly keyboard has had problems with longevity in previous versions This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Opponents are denouncing the move, which sparked protests on Monday, as a blatantly undemocratic negation of the November election results.Similarly contentious efforts are afoot in Michigan, where Democrats regained three important statewide positions in November – that of governor, attorney general and secretary of state. Instead of accepting the will of voters, Republican lawmakers are now seeking to reduce the control of those post-holders over campaign finance and legal proceedings involving the state before the Democratic victors take office.Elsewhere, Georgia continues to be racked with disputes over claims of Republican voter suppression before Tuesday’s runoff election for the key post of secretary of state, while North Carolina is grappling with allegations of voter fraud in a close congressional race that remains unresolved.Wisconsin’s power play is attracting the most nationwide attention given the unashamed attempt by state Republicans in effect to reverse the outcome of the November ballot, in which all six statewide positions were won by Democrats, including the governorship. The Republican-controlled legislature is hoping to vote on Tuesday on 40 proposed amendments contained in five bills that would starkly weaken the remit of the incoming Democratic officeholders even before they take office.The proposed changes would prevent the governor-elect, Tony Evers, and attorney general-elect, Josh Kaul, from honoring one of their central promises to voters in the midterm campaign: the pledge to pull Wisconsin out of a multi-state legal challenge to Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The new legislation would also gut the state’s department of justice of several core functions, transferring them from Kaul’s office to the Republican-controlled legislature.The incoming post-holders have decried their rivals’ tactics as fundamentally undemocratic. “It goes to the heart of what democracy is all about,” Evers told reporters, saying the flurry of conservative moves was “an embarrassment for the state”.Kaul told the Wisconsin State Journal: “This is fundamentally inconsistent with how a democracy is supposed to work. If this passes it’s going to significantly impair the ability of the state government to function effectively next year, because if it passes, it’s almost certain to end up in court.”Should the bills pass and end up for approval on the desk of the outgoing Republican governor, Scott Walker, they would bookend his eight years in office in an inferno of controversy. Walker started his governorship in 2011 by introducing the notorious Act 10, which removed most collective bargaining rights from public sector unions, sparking mass protests at the capitol building in Madison.Those protests were echoed on Monday with a fresh round of unrest in Madison, with opponents of the power grab heckling Republican lawmakers with chants of “Respect my vote”.The audacious effort to defy the will of voters is a direct repeat of the playbook first adopted by Republicans in North Carolina two years ago. In the wake of the 2016 elections, in which the Democrat Roy Cooper unseated the Republican governor Pat McCrory, GOP leaders staged a special session in which they pared down the governor’s executive powers three weeks before Cooper took office.This November, Republicans in North Carolina tried further to water down the governor’s powers with two constitutional amendments that would have limited his control over appointments to the state judiciary and board of elections. The amendments failed at the ballot box, but had they passed one commentator for the Raleigh News \u0026amp Observer noted they would have reduced the role to that of “a potted plant”.North Carolina is back in the news this week with a continuing investigation by the state’s elections board into an extremely tight House race for the ninth congressional district. The Republican candidate Mark Harris is narrowly ahead in the contest with about 900 more votes out of 283,000 cast than his Democratic opponent, Dan McCready.The result has yet to be certified by the board, which is looking into irregularities over absentee ballots. Democratic voters in Bladen and Robeson counties, in the east of the state, have submitted affidavits stating that their absentee ballots were collected in unsealed envelopes by unidentified iniduals.One voter said she had handed over her unfinished ballot to a woman who said she would “finish it herself”.The fallout of acrimonious elections on 6 November also continues to be felt in Georgia where a fierce battle is still being waged in a Tuesday runoff for the post of secretary of state, the office that controls the state’s electoral system. The Donald Trump-endorsed Republican candidate, Brad Raffensperger, was slightly ahead of his Democratic rival, John Barrow, in the first round. The Georgia contest is being fought over the vacated seat of Brian Kemp, who won the governor’s race in November amid a storm of protest that as the then secretary of state, he presided over a slew of voter suppression measures. A political group supporting the losing Democratic candidate, Stacey Abrams, has launched a federal lawsuit challenging the conduct of the state’s midterm elections at every level.The three states in the throes of partisan tussles are at the forefront of Republican voter suppression efforts. Part of Wisconsin’s proposed new legislation in the lame-duck session is a reduction in early voting days that has the potential to bring Republican lawmakers into direct confrontation with federal courts.Democrats were given a big boost in the November election by record turnout in Wisconsin in early voting, with some 565,000 taking advantage of polling stations being open before election day. Now the Republicans want to whittle down the time allotted for such voting.A similar effort to restrict early voting was ruled unconstitutional in 2016 by a federal judge, James Peterson, who found that the Republican scheme “intentionally discriminates on the basis of race”. Peterson concluded that the conservative leadership had been specifically motivated by a desire to place hurdles to voting in the way of the dominant black population in the state’s largest city, Milwaukee.He wrote that the legislature’s goal was brazenly partisan: “to suppress the reliably Democratic vote of Milwaukee’s African Americans”.The revival of restrictions exposes the Wisconsin legislature to possible claims of contempt of court. The liberal issue advocacy group One Wisconsin Now told reporters on Monday that it was preparing for legal action against the lawmakers depending on the outcome of the lame-duck session.“Republicans believe they lost the November election because too many people voted here, and are trying to undo the results of the vote by taking power from the elected governor and attorney general,” said Scott Ross, One Wisconsin Now’s executive director.He added: “We are a democracy only as long as elected officials don’t place themselves above the law.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c341f3fbbe9c99aa36e4c16109adc613394923/0_171_2736_1642/master/2736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cb9bb615d491b735e99b0ebef6a207c","title":"mafia godfather among 45 alleged mobsters held in sicily luigi di maio","story":"Palermo mafia boss Settimo Mineo arrested in crackdown to halt return of fearsome ‘Cupola’ groupItalian police have arrested 46 alleged mobsters, including 80-year-old Settimo Mineo, who investigators say was recently elected the head of a notorious mafia body.The carabinieri struck at dawn on Tuesday in the Sicilian province of Palermo, acting against those accused of resurrecting, after 25 years, the fearsome Cupola, or Sicilian mafia commission, a body made up of the leading members of Cosa Nostra, which decides important questions concerning criminal actions such as killings.“When you try to resurrect the Cupola, it means you are about to do something really serious,’’ said Francesco Lo Voi, Palermo’s chief prosecutor, in a press conference. “We needed to stop them before it was too late.’’Mineo, the owner of a jewellery shop in Corso Tukory, Palermo, is the Sicilian mafia’s oldest boss. He was arrested in 1984 by the legendary prosecutor Giovanni Falcone, who was assassinated by Cosa Nostra in 1992, and jailed for mafia-related crimes.The existence of the Cupola, which included the most powerful Sicilian bosses in a sort of G7 of the mafia, first came to light during the Maxi trial in 1986-87. The last head of that commission was the most ruthless godfather of the Sicilian mafia, Salvatore “Totò” Riina, nicknamed “the Beast” and known for having personally killed and ordered the assassination of dozens maybe hundreds of people, including magistrates and policemen.To date, the total number of the Cupola’s victims remains a mystery. Riina died in prison in 2017 after he was arrested in 1993, and until the day of his death he remained, at least officially, the head of the Cupola.More than 4,000 mafiosi have been arrested in Sicily since the arrest of Riina, and hundreds of millions of euros have been confiscated, weakening the power of Cosa Nostra throughout Sicily. Yet the mafia, wounded and staggering, has never completely surrendered, trying several times to reorganise and resuscitate itself.‘‘The mafia will never accept defeat,’’ said the former magistrate Giuseppe Di Lello, who worked in the anti-mafia taskforce that was chasing Riina in the 1980s, when the mafia was at the height of its power.He is one of the few anti-mafia magistrates from those years who is still alive. Many of his colleagues, including Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, were killed on the order of the Cupola. “But every time the bosses try to raise their heads, the authorities block them before they get up. The reality is that after Riina’s death there were no more bosses able to replace him. Not to mention that thanks to new technologies, such as telephone tapping and surveillance cameras, it is difficult for the mafia to move without going unnoticed.’’Mineo, the elderly boss arrested at dawn who had to replace Totò Riina at the helm of Cosa Nostra, knew this well. He did not have a mobile phone and went about on foot for fear that the police had put bugs in his car. “The other mobsters chose him, because Mineo represented the old Cosa Nostra,” said Federico Cafiero de Raho, chief of the anti-mafia national prosecution office. “And by choosing him, they also chose the old methods of intimidations, like sending severed lamb’s heads to the businessmen who refused to pay the protection money.’’Mineo risked being killed in 1982 in an ambush by a rival mafia family.He immediately earned the respect of Riina, who gave him a leading role. He was arrested in 1984 for mafia-related crimes and then again in 2006, serving over 10 years in prison, but he never cooperated with the police.In 1982 a rival murdered his brother in Mineo’s jewellery store.Some time ago he tried to go to the US, but the authorities denied him a visa.Typical of Mineo’s old-school mafioso methods, he tried not to attract attention, keeping a low profile, aware that his every move could be discovered by the police. But it wasn’t enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcf1f4214518ac3e5197b4aa6477a3673bc40ccb/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85ec809cb518f897221431bad32ae768","title":"memory lanes the ramblers trying to save 10000 lost footpaths","story":"It’s not just walkers who get lost – paths can get lost, too. Now a small army of volunteers are seeking to recover thousands of public rights of way before they disappear for everPaul Howland is standing in a bed of nettles, his head surrounded by a halo of dusky blue sloes. Behind him is an impenetrable tangle of undergrowth, self-seeded trees and what looks like the long-discarded parts of an a vehicle.“The old path went up here,” he says, waving his walking pole further into the thicket. “I first spotted it on Milne’s county map of Hampshire from 1791.”Howland emerges from the nettles and shows me an image on his phone which confirms his suspicions: we have just found one of Britain’s missing footpaths.“This is Greenwood’s 1826 county map and you can see the path. It was called the Markway and goes straight up to this line – now the A30 road. But compare that with the current Ordnance Survey map.” He unfolds a paper map and points to our position.“Instead of going straight, the footpath turns hard left at this point and heads back towards Andover. What we have here is a missing mile to a forgotten right of way – and a very useful missing mile, because it links to other footpaths.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but there are an estimated 10,000 more that have been lost from current maps. Even that figure looks like a huge underestimate: a recent survey in Cornwall alone identified 3,000 possible paths that had fallen out of use and needed to be checked. That work of rediscovery is being done by volunteers, people such as Howland, who has so far made 85 legal applications for the recovery of lost paths in a small corner of Hampshire. A government deadline of 2026 for such claims has given Howland’s work a renewed sense of urgency.“It sounds like plenty of time, but I reckon that in our area we’d need to make two applications every week until 2026. There is just so much to be done.”As a walker, I reflect, I’m used to losing my way. It’s a bit alarming, however, to find that paths can get lost, too.Howland chuckles. “It’s easier than you think.”If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.You can get in touch by filling in this encrypted form.Your responses will only be seen by the  and we’ll be in touch if we are considering your response as part of our reporting. You can read terms of service\u0026nbsphere.We give up any attempt to force a way through the bushes and set off up the path to the left. Two deer watch us warily from a stubble field and the giant white dish of a radio telescope appears to hover on the horizon as we catch up with a group from the Ramblers, among them Jack Cornish, project manager for the nationwide campaign Don’t Lose Your Way. He explains how government legislation in 1949 ruled that every council should draw a definitive map of footpaths and bridleways, a laudable aim, but one carried out piecemeal.“Some parishes recorded hundreds of paths, others did almost nothing. You ended up with footpaths that led nowhere or simply disappeared.” Once those paths failed to appear on OS maps, people stopped walking them. The nettles grew, the ash and sycamore seeds blew in and, within a few years, they were invisible. If a housing estate or a major road then appeared, that path was truly lost. And it did not only happen in the countryside. The Open Spaces Society has pointed out that urban areas were often exempt from the 1949 regulations and produced no definitive maps, leaving footpaths in cities and towns particularly under threat.Howland has a rough estimate of losses from his own experience. “In my area I expect an annual loss of half a percent – mostly from new buildings and roads.”“Those missing paths can be the vital element in a good circular walk, or access to great countryside.”“These are ancient rights of way,” Cornish adds. “Rights built up over centuries. And it’s not just about walkers: cyclists and horse riders need them, too.”We reach a sign – “Private road, access only” – and ignore it. “It’s a public bridleway,” says Howland, reassuringly. One of the ramblers finds a sign lost in the undergrowth and, producing a pair of secateurs, quickly makes it visible again.Walking with Howland is to see the British landscape through a fresh pair of eyes. Where I see walls of thorny bushes, he sees a double hedge hiding an ancient drovers’ path where I see neat white posts at the entrance to someone’s drive, Howland sees a devious attempt to gull the public into believing they are on private land most of all, where I see cul-de-sacs and dead ends, he spots opportunities to discover lost routes. He reads the landscape like a detective, building the physical elements into narratives of growth and change.He shows me a patch of land on his OS map called Bransbury Common that was declared open-access land under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Almost surrounded by a chalk stream, it was both biologically important and a local beauty spot. For as long as it has been an open-access area, the two bridges that once allowed entry have been unusable. They have never been replaced. “The public have the right to be on Bransbury Common,” says Howland. “But getting there is harder.”He has seen abandoned railways, used as footpaths and recorded as such on OS maps, summarily closed when new owners arrive. In other places, agricultural schemes such as the Countryside Stewardship demand that landowners open up paths in return for payments. When the schemes finish, these “permissive” paths can disappear overnight. On other occasions, new owners simply don’t understand local traditions. In October 2016, for example, villagers in Bratton, in Wiltshire, were astonished to find a traditional riverside path through watercress beds blocked by barbed wire and “private property” signs. A London property dealer had bought the local mill and erected the barriers. It took a two-year court battle to establish that the path was a legal right of way.“There are two ways to recover a lost path,” Cornish says. “By proving regular public use over a 20-year period without any attempt to prevent access by a landowner, and by detective work on historical maps.” What about the Markway, I ask. How did that disappear?“Almost by accident.” Howland says. “In the second world war, a Hurricane fighter base was built here and the path temporarily blocked. That order was not rescinded until 1956. By then it was too late: the last mile of the route had got overgrown and forgotten.” If not for Howland, this right of way would have permanently disappeared.We stop talking to stroll along a short section of busy road, before turning once again on to a path where spindle flowers gleam like nubs of coral in the hedge. A kestrel cuts away across the field, glorying in its freedom. We come eventually into the pretty thatched village of Chilbolton and, in the way of all good country walks, reach a pub.Over a bowl of hot soup, Howland shows me the paperwork that each Definitive Map Modification Order entails. “It does take hours of work, but a lot of the information and maps are now online. The National Library of Scotland website is particularly useful. You don’t need to be spending days in the National Archives at Kew, interesting as that would be.”The campaign has put pressure on under-resourced local councils. Hampshire’s executive member for rural affairs, Edward Heron, pointed out to me that Hampshire has seen a rise in applications from five a year to 35. “We expect that these increases will continue until the closure date of 2026.”The good news is that any application submitted by the 2026 deadline will, eventually, go through the legal process of assessment and consultation.Meanwhile Howland is planning more routes. His diffident manner masks a steely determination, and he clearly likes the elements of research and historical analysis. “It’s given me a better understanding of how the landscape changes and develops.” In theory, that research could go back to the era of Richard I. His reign, which began on 4 July 1189, is the beginning of legal time. In practice, many rights of way date back to the enclosure acts of 1750 to 1850. Either way the sense of a long game being played is palpable and Howland knows it.“A restored right of way will usually last for ever.” He smiles. “There aren’t many tasks in life that you can say that about.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The talks are taking place against a backdrop of continued fighting.Iranian-backed Houthi fighters seized control of the capital, Sana’a, in March 2015 in protest at rising oil prices, ousting the UN recognised Hadi government. Supported militarily by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the Hadi government has been fighting to win back control of the country, leading to mass famine and tens of thousands of civilian deaths.Griffiths is trying to learn the lessons of the previous failed talks in September, when Houthi negotiators felt unable to travel to Geneva after undertakings about wounded soldiers and the return of the negotiators to Yemen at the end of the talks were not met.Partly by staying physically close to the Houthis, Griffiths appears to have made more progress with the often ided group than any previous UN mediator.The Houthi team and Griffiths left on a plane chartered by Kuwait, one of the Middle East’s mediator countries, on Tuesday.The Hadi government’s team will follow the Houthis, reversing the choreography of Geneva where Hadi’s team was left waiting for the Houthis to arrive.In the first step of a tortuous process the Hadi government on Monday allowed 50 Houthi fighters to fly to Oman for treatment accompanied by doctors.The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said the transfer of the wounded fighters was “the essential precondition for the talks”.The deal on prisoner swaps would cover between 1,500 and 2,000 members of the pro-government forces and between 1,000 and 1,500 rebels, according to a government official, Hadi Haig.The ICRC will identify the iniduals to be released, and the modalities of the release.Pressure was also being applied on Hadi’s government to pay the salaries of civil servants in Houthi-controlled areas, and to allow the opening of the international airport at Sana’a.Hadi himself has been an exiled leader, often in Riyadh and recently in the US. He is not held in high regard by the Emiratis, and the government delegation will be led by the Yemeni foreign minister, Khaled Alyemany.The Yemeni government has increasingly relied on Washington’s belief that Iranians have been using Yemen as a base to attack Saudi Arabia, but US senators are putting unexpectedly strong pressure on the Trump administration to end US support for the war.David Miliband, the president of the International Rescue Committee humanitarian organisation, and one of the international figures watching the Yemen crisis most closely, urged the US to keep pressure on Saudi Arabia to negotiate.“We call on the US and UK, as military supporters to the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition in Yemen, to use their influence to encourage meaningful dialogue in these talks and ensure the result is a reduction in violence, improved humanitarian and commercial access around the country… and salary payments to public sector workers,” he said.Anwar Gargash, the United Arab Emirates foreign affairs minister, said the Sweden talks were a “critical opportunity” to find a political resolution. “A sustainable Yemeni-led political solution offers the best chance to ending the current crisis. A stable state, important for the region, cannot coexist with unlawful militias,” he said.The UN humanitarian chief, Martin Lowcock, freshly back from Yemen, said the country will need billions next year and predicted the talks would not be a fast process.Hunt has also disclosed UK plans to hold a vote on a new UN resolution calling for a ceasefire in Yemen have been delayed until after the peace talks have concluded.Pressed by the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, Hunt conceded the UK had to make compromises on the draft text of the UN resolution. “I can confirm both the original text, and the current text, refers to international humanitarian law, but in the process of getting that text agreed, did we make compromises to the Saudis, did we make compromises to the Houthis? Yes, we did, and as a result of this diplomacy, talks are happening this week.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3710948.1543243876!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why some schools do better than others","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“There’s a debate about how influential schools are in terms of academic success, with some studies saying it only accounts for about 20 per cent of a student’s academic achievement.” Photograph: iStockIt’s no surprise to find that schools in Dublin 4 send more students to third-level than schools in Dublin 24. Parents tend to be that bit more taken aback to find that schools in Donegal generally send more students to third-level than those in Wicklow.But why do some schools do better – in the narrow sense of sending more students on to third-level – than others? We asked education experts for their views.John MacGabhann is general secretary of the Teachers Union of Ireland. Dr Jennifer Symonds is an assistant professor at the UCD School of Education. Dr Anthony Malone is a lecturer at Maynooth University’s Department of Education. Cathy McLoughlin is head of the access service at DCU, which runs the largest university access programme in Ireland.“Why are houses bigger in Dublin 4 than in Dublin 24?” asks MacGabhann, a long-time critic of the publication of college progression data. “This is the middle-class establishment looking in the mirror and saying: ‘Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?’ They send more to third-level than others because of economic factors. Of course, the lists reflect back to them the value of their own choices.”Fee-paying schools have a particular advantage, he says. “They raise more through fees than through the Department of Education subvention. If 500 pupils are charged €6,000 per year, that gives the school a nest egg of €3 million – money that a school in the public system could only dream of – to buy additional teachers and better staffing levels, as well as more middle-management roles for the better administration of the school. It’s always been our view that, while parents have a right to send their children to fee-paying schools, our tax revenues should not be funding these exclusionary practices.”Symonds points to Irish data which show that students in disadvantaged schools still have less chance of attending college even after accounting for their attainment. She suggests one of the influencing factors could be money. “There are systemic issues: when people look for part-time work to support themselves through college, they are often restricted to low-wage, temporary and insecure jobs, so employers need to be under pressure to improve the conditions of employment.”Malone says there is mountains of evidence, dating back to the 1964 Coleman report, to show that inequality and social deprivation has a long-lasting impact on academic achievement. “The better schools are those vested in helping both students from higher and lower socioeconomic backgrounds to achieve. Supporting cultures of high expectations, wraparound supports and quality teaching and learning are all important. But there’s a debate about how influential schools are in terms of academic success, with some studies saying it only accounts for about 20 per cent of a student’s academic achievement. Family background and other social factors may be more significant.”“Ireland has long had a preoccupation with academic success,” says Malone. “The post-primary system, formally founded in legislation in 1878, was based on competition and a narrow view of achievement. If you talk to students now about how they got on in school, they’ll usually talk about their exam results, but this tells us little about the quality of their educational experience. These tables are grounded in that tradition. There is an argument that we should have as much transparency in our education system as possible, but league tables can narrow the conversation and ignore the structural inequalities in education.”Grinds and extra tuition are more easily available to students from families with disposable income, says McLoughlin. “Among access students, 97 per cent graduate with higher honours. Why didn’t they perform as well in the Leaving Cert? They didn’t have access to grinds, grinds schools, and the preparation for the exams. If they did, it might push them up a grade or two.”MacGabhann is sceptical of the idea that grinds buy better teachers. “Where’s the evidence? The grind schools claim they have the best teachers, but what is a good teacher? They’re no better than teachers in other schools. Grinds imply what the word sounds like: a type of force-feeding, compacting into notes and removing discretion to allow the student think for themselves. While they might make sense in certain circumstances – such as if a child is very ill – time spent on grinds would be better spent on independent learning and developing the critical-thinking skills that would really serve them well at college by lessening their chances of dropping out.”\u0026nbsp“Conversations about going to college start at a young age in many households,” says McLoughlin. “That doesn’t happen in every household, particularly where there is no tradition of going to third-level. If a parent has had a bad experience of education themselves, they might be more inclined to agree that Irish has no use or that maths is terrible. Immediately, certain courses are ruled out, because they may not be aware they need maths for engineering or Irish for primary teaching. There are households who may not know about how Susi could cover a lot of costs. By the time it is discussed, it can be transition year and that’s a little late to be talking about careers and aspirations.”Symonds says young people are hugely influenced by the expectations others have of them. “Having a high-quality aspiration is a powerful shaper of career pathways, and this could be for an apprenticeship or a strong vocational route – this is just as important whether the student is in a Deis school or an expensive fee-paying school. An inclusive school is about accepting everyone, including those who aspire to different pathways. College isn’t the right route for all young people, and evidence from the US shows that funnelling people down that pathway leads to higher drop-out rates.”Maths, Irish, science, technology and modern language teachers are in short supply. McLaughlin says Deis schools are having particular problems in recruiting and retaining teachers. “If you’re a teacher with a choice of jobs, you may go for a school that’s less challenging. We’re also hearing that teachers prefer jobs outside Dublin due to the cost of living in the city.”Working with colleagues, Symonds interviewed young Irish people from Dublin Deis schools about their experiences of classwork. “The majority said they were motivated to learn and found classwork meaningful. But there was a discrepancy between what was said and how some students behaved: we found about 20 per cent not concentrating because they were distracted by others, resulting in lower attainment. This can be a vicious cycle for students who are grouped into lower-attainment classes where disruptive students often coalesce.”Taking an approach which focuses on the strengths of learners, we need to look at what is happening in the classroom to prevent learning, says Symonds. “We should acknowledge that students often need a high degree of motivation to pay attention to material that’s not necessarily interesting. The system as it is privileges students who like to sit down and read and write, and doesn’t always acknowledge that adolescents seek autonomy and don’t like being told what to do.”Young people who don’t enjoy school work can quickly disengage from school, and identify as someone who doesn’t work hard or want to go to college, says Symonds. “Schools and parents that hold high aspirations for their students – vocational or academic, and link these pathways to classwork, while helping students stay focused and avoid distractions, may see better outcomes.”"},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Photograph: DANIEL LEAL-OLIVASAFPGetty ImagesBritain should be allowed to unilaterally revoke its departure notice from the European Union, an adviser to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) said on Tuesday, before a landmark ruling in the coming weeks.The non-binding opinion for the ECJ comes as the British parliament begins five days of debate on prime minister Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal with the EU before voting on it next Tuesday.“Advocate General (Manuel) Campos Sanchez-Bordona proposes that the Court of Justice should declare that Article 50 ... allows the unilateral revocation of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU,” the ECJ said.“That possibility continues to exist until such time as the withdrawal agreement is formally concluded,” it said in a statement, meaning Britain would have to notify the EU that it has changed its mind before Brexit day, on March 29th, 2019.“The Advocate General emphasises that withdrawal from an international treaty, which is the reverse of treaty-making power, is by definition a unilateral act of a state party and a manifestation of its sovereignty,” the court also said.“A member state which decides to withdraw is to notify the European Council of ‘its intention’ - and not of its decision - to withdraw, and such an intention may change,” it added. “It would be illogical to force that member state to withdraw from the EU in order to then have to negotiate its accession.”The court, which tends to follow the advocate general’s opinion in its final decisions, did not give an exact date for the ruling but it is expected in the coming weeks.Ms May has agreed an exit pact and an outline of future EU-UK ties with the other 27 states staying on together after Brexit. But the proposed accord still needs the endorsement of the British parliament, where it faces stiff opposition.The other EU states, as well as the European Commission, want any revocation of Britain’s withdrawal notice to require the consent of the bloc, fearing that, otherwise, Britain or other would be leavers could use this tactic to win concessions.Tuesday’s opinion rejects that argument but says that “good faith and sincere cooperation must also be observed” in any withdrawal of the exit notice.The case was brought before the ECJ by Scottish politicians opposed to Brexit. They hope it could pave the way for a potential second Brexit referendum, giving voters the option to remain in the EU.“That puts the decision about our future back into the hands of our own elected representatives,” said Jo Maugham, one of the lawyers involved in the case.Both May and the EU have said that, if the British parliament votes this offer down, Britain would risk crashing out of the bloc with no deal in place to mitigate the damage. May says it would risk not delivering the Brexit that the British people voted for.But the tentative deal is also opposed by advocates of a sharp break from the EU and she is struggling to get enough backing for it, even within her own party.“Every effort is being made on both sides of the Channel to stop Brexit,” prominent ‘Leave’ campaigner Nigel Farage said after the ECJ statement. Theresa May will on Tuesday appeal to MPs to back her Brexit deal at the start of five days of debate on the agreement, which is opposed by much of her own party as well as by the opposition. The prime minister will say that the deal respects the outcome of the 2016 referendum and will return to Britain control of its borders, laws and money.“The British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country, whichever way we voted. This is the deal that delivers for the British people,” she is expected to say.John Bercow, the Speaker, allowed Labour, the DUP and four other opposition parties to lay down a motion that will be voted on Tuesday, immediately before before the start of the five-day debate on the Brexit dealThe motion, submitted late on Monday, calls on MPs to find “ministers in contempt for their failure to comply” and is signed by the shadow Brexitsecretary, Sir Keir Starmer the DUP’s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds and the Scottish National party, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green party.Attorney general Geoffrey Cox told MPs on Monday that Britain would have to remain indefinitely in the Northern Ireland backstop if negotiations failed to produce a free-trade deal that kept the Border open. Mr Cox was speaking after the publication of an overview of his legal advice to the government on Brexit, which followed a demand by MPs that they should see his full advice to the cabinet.“I make no bones about it, I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination of this backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit if negotiations have irretrievably broken down. But I am prepared to lend my support to this agreement because I do not believe that we are likely to be entrapped in it permanently,” Mr Cox said.The attorney general said that the backstop would offer Northern Ireland’s traders a competitive advantage over traders from European Union member states, including Ireland, because they could trade freely in both the single market and the rest of the UK. He suggested that, if the backstop persisted beyond a short period, it would be subject to a legal challenge in the European Court of Justice on the grounds that article 50 of the EU treaty could not be the basis of a permanent arrangement with a non-EU state.Dozens of Conservative MPs have said publicly that they would vote against the withdrawal agreement, along with the DUP and the opposition parties. But Mr Cox said that, when weighed against the alternatives to backing the prime minister’s deal, it was a risk worth taking.“This represents a sensible compromise. It has unattractive elements, unsatisfactory elements for us. But the question for the House is to weigh it up against the other potential alternatives and to assess whether it amounts to a calculated risk that this government and this House should take in these circumstances,” he said. – Additional reporting ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

It allows thousands of women to order affordably priced products - from sanitary pads and condoms to shampoos and body lotions - on their mobile phones. Customers can order online, or those without smartphones can dial *119 to use an offline, text message based version to make purchases. The orders are then dispatched and delivered to their door in discreet packaging by moped or, in particularly remote regions, a local Kasha ‘agent’. Access to contraception“There was absolutely a gap in technology serving women and women’s needs,” said Joanna, who started the company with business partner Amanda Arch after leaving the Seattle tech bubble. “We have an e-commerce model, but we have chosen to optimise for women and underserved consumers.The approach appears to be working Kasha delivered its 100,000th order this month and has close to 20,000 customers. Products which are seen as \u0027embarrassing\u0027 to purchase in shops - including sanitary pads, condoms, HIV tests and emergency contraception - have been the most popular purchases. “We serve women across segments, from low income women in rural communities to executive women in offices,” said Dianne Dusaidi, Rwanda country director. “We’ve actually been surprised with how popular we’ve been with rural areas, we thought Kasha might just appeal to the middle classes.”Contraception use has skyrocketed in Rwanda, but stigma remainsCentral to the company\u0027s appeal is what it calls the Kasha ladies. Built on an Avon-style model, the company employs 75 women who work in predominantly rural communities, to build trust with clients and explain how e-commerce - still in its infancy in Rwanda - works. “The majority of our agents are widows, single mothers or breadwinners,” said Malyse Uwase, regional health and impact manager. “We look for women who are motivated and trusted in their community, who can talk through products and help people through the ordering process. They’re the face of Kasha.” Kasha received funding from the UK’s Department of International Development (DfID) and Unilever’s Transform programme to get started, but hopes to be profitable and self sufficient by early 2020 - and to expand across the developing world.Kasha was built to be global, said Joanna. More people should be watching the \u0027femtech\u0027 space, it has the potential to revolutionise women’s health.” Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article  Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityDepartment for International DevelopmentBrexit deal latest news: Theresa May faces crunch contempt vote as MPs try to block no-deal orce from EUComment: Why the French riot over modest fuel tax rises - while we Brits calmly carry out constitutional suicideItalian police arrest alleged head of Cosa Nostra and more than 40 other mafia mobstersWhen does Parliament vote on the Brexit deal?

Meanwhile, 27 per cent were found to be obese, and 72 per cent admitted consuming fewer than five portions of fruit and vegetables daily.More than half those polled had at least two risk factors, the data for England from 2016 and 2017 found.The survey asked 8,000 adults and 2,000 children about their lifestyles.The findings show a steep rise in diabetes rates between 1994 and 2017 - from 3 per cent to 8 per cent among men, and from 2 to 5 per cent among women.  The increase has been largest for those aged 65 to 74, increasing from 5 per cent in 1994 to 15 per cent in 2017.The research also compared the lifestyles of children with their parents.Children of obese parents were around three times more likely to be obese than children of healthy weight parents. In total, 28 per cent of children of an obese mother and 24 per cent of children of an obese father had such weight problems.One in 20 women in England is now classed as morbidly obese, according to the analysis by NHS Digital. Overall, 64 per cent of adults were found to be carrying excess weight.This includes five per cent of women and two per cent of men who are morbidly obese - meaning they have a body mass index (BMI) score over 40.In 1993, when the survey began, just one per cent of women were morbidly obese.Susannah Brown, senior scientist at World Cancer Research Fund, said: “Unhealthy choices increase the likelihood of developing cancer, so it is worrying to see that over half of adults have two or more of these risk factors, especially as we know that around 40 per cent of cancer cases are preventable.After not smoking, eating a healthy diet, being more active each day and maintaining a healthy weight are the most important ways you can reduce your cancer risk. The responsibility to live healthily does not lie solely with iniduals – a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach is necessary to create environments for people and communities that are conducive to healthy living, she said.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said the figures should “shame” successive governments, accusing them of failing to take action to encourage healthier lifestyles.John Maingay, Director of Policy and Public Affairs at the British Heart Foundation, said:  “These alarming figures suggest we could be storing up a future of health problems for future generations unless we act now. Obese children are more likely to be obese adults and this, coupled with spiralling diabetes rates, could lead to thousands more people suffering heart attacks and strokes in the coming years.”Almost 4 million people in the UK have been diagnosed with diabetes, with nine in ten cases Type 2, which is linked to obesity. Dan Howarth, from Diabetes UK, warned that another 12 million people are at risk of developing the condition.“To prevent these millions from developing Type 2 diabetes, we must educate people about their risk of developing the condition, and help them minimise their risk by making the necessary lifestyle changes, which include eating better and moving more, he said. Brexit deal latest news: Theresa May faces crunch contempt vote as MPs try to block no-deal orce from EUVideo comment: The first Ballon d\u0026#39Or award to a female athlete was overshadowed by a dose of pointless sexismComment: The French riot over modest fuel tax rises - while we Brits calmly carry out constitutional suicideItalian police arrest alleged head of Cosa Nostra and more than 40 other mafia mobstersWhen does Parliament vote on the Brexit deal?

And then update them again.Early next year, the company should release an update that brings a wireless charging case that allows them to power up just by being placed onto a wireless charging mat. It might also bring other changes, such as improved connectivity, an improved hinge on the door that clicks open and lets the earphones out\u0026nbspand new features, leaks suggested.That\u0027s according to a report from usually reliably analyst Ming-Chi\u0026nbspKuo, who reports that none of the new earphones will be ready for this Christmas season.Then a year later, in early 2020, the company will bring an all-new design. He did not reveal what those would look like, but previous rumours have suggested that waterproofing and always-on hey Siri could be on their way.iPhone X could come back after weak sales of new Apple phonesThe report made no mention of AirPower, the wireless charging mat that was first announced more than a year ago and has mostly disappeared in the time since. The wirelessly charging AirPods and the charging mat had been announced together, with the new case expected in part so that the AirPods\u0026nbspcould be used on the mat alongside other Apple products.Apple has not commented on a possible release date for the AirPower\u0026nbspmat. Rumours have suggested that the company might be struggling to make the technology work, and some have suggested that it might be dropped entirely.The company had even showed off what appeared to be the new AirPods\u0026nbspcase alongside its charging mat, suggesting that both would be coming soon. It\u0027s not clear if the two products\u0027 delays are related.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Ashley told politicians on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most high streets are beyond help.“The mainstream high streets are already dead. They can’t survive, the patient is dead,” he said, comparing the traditional town centre to a dead body at the bottom of a swimming pool. “Now what we’re talking about is can we save the vast minority?”Continuing with his mortality metaphor, the Newcastle United owner said the only way to resuscitate struggling retail companies was to give them a “massive electric shock”, in the form of a tax on online players. Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisEvans Cycles sold to Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct Sports Direct sacks House of Fraser management teamAmazon named UK’s most reputable retailer as Sports Direct comes lastHe called for a 20 per cent sales tax on web purchases, to be applied to companies making more than 20 per cent of their sales online, which he said would encourage retailers to focus on their bricks and mortar stores. “The internet is killing the high street. If you want to save the high street you have to address that,” he said. “You have to tax the web boys 20 per cent.” The retail tycoon said this would have a negative impact on his own company, but said it was necessary “for the good of the high street”. Mr Ashley bought House of Fraser out of administration earlier this year, and has vowed to save 80 per cent of the company’s stores. He also holds a significant stake in Debenhams and recently took over Evans Cycles. The committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, to which Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”He then added: “Before anybody says it, I’m not comparing myself to God.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Perhaps most intriguingly of them all is a big container that includes seeds and insect eggs and hence create living things that will have been born on the Moon.Nasa video says it is going back to the Moon –\u0026nbspand staying thereThe country’s space agency will blast off in just a few days, after\u0026nbspa series of successful tests. It sets off Saturday, 8 December, and is expected to drop onto the Moon early next year.It will head up towards the Moon, fly around it and then drop down, into a specially selected region of the Moon that will become its home.Once there, it will look to learn a whole host of things about that nearby but still largely mysterious world. It will measure the surface temperature, examine the chemicals that make up its soil, as well as looking up at the Sun.But the mission is possible because it relies not only on the lander that will touch down on the Moon. It is also made up of a set of other hardware – chief among them the\u0026nbspQueqiao satellite, which will serve as a bridge and relay information between the lander on the far side of the Moon and its engineers down on Earth.Just as with the world it will explore, much of the mission remains murky and unknown. The Chinese space agency has stayed largely quiet about details of what will happen, including where exactly on the Moon it will arrive.Its mission comes amid a new focus on the Moon – particularly as an important stepping stone on the way to other missions, deeper into the solar system. Nasa, for instance, has spoken about how keen it is to send humans back there, with the aim of eventually using it as a base for journeys to Mars.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I mean adequate support for our most vulnerable children with SEND,\u0026nbspwhich is a basic expectation of a decent, developed society. We need to do better.Ofsted’s report also highlights the watchdog’s concerns about the number of children with SEND\u0026nbspbeing moved off the school roll - a practice known as off-rolling.Half of the 19,000 GCSE-aged pupils that dropped off school rolls between 2016 and 2017 did not reappear on another state-funded school roll.Around 30 per cent of those have SEND, compared to 13 per cent of all pupils.\u0026nbspFifty-four\u0026nbspper cent are eligible for free school meals, compared to 28 per cent of all pupils.Inspectors said this was a “huge cause for concern” and suggested many schools were practising illegal off-rolling to boost performance data.Launching Ofsted\u0027s annual report in London on Tuesday, Ms\u0026nbspSpielman\u0026nbspargued that children from poorer backgrounds, who face challenges at home or struggle with learning, faced a “steeper” path to educational progress than pupils from wealthier families.She said: “There is a group of young people who seem to have the deck stacked against them. Perhaps the most important thing we can do to reduce that gradient is to get the basics right.“Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

While it is not possible to say that the rising chemical levels caused this early puberty onset, rather than some other unmeasured variable that is associated with these chemical levels, experts said the study was otherwise well conducted and could be important for\u0026nbsppublic health policy makers.”The age of puberty has been advancing over the years and other factors such as ethnicity are also important contributors. The other main theory put forward for earlier onset of puberty is an increased prevalence of overweight and obese children,” said Dr Ali\u0026nbspAbbara, clinical senior lecturer in endocrinology at Imperial College London who was not involved in the research.“Generally limiting unnecessary exposure of chemicals if avoidable is sensible to avoid potential harm, however in practice this may difficult to do as they are so ubiquitously present.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.A representative for West also told the New York Times: “Kanye was on his phone taking notes.

Mr Ashley told politicians on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most high streets are beyond help.“The mainstream high streets are already dead. They can’t survive, the patient is dead,” he said, comparing the traditional town centre to a dead body at the bottom of a swimming pool. “Now what we’re talking about is can we save the vast minority?”Continuing with his mortality metaphor, the Newcastle United owner said the only way to resuscitate struggling retail companies was to give them a “massive electric shock”, in the form of a tax on online players. Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisEvans Cycles sold to Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct Sports Direct sacks House of Fraser management teamAmazon named UK’s most reputable retailer as Sports Direct comes lastHe called for a 20 per cent sales tax on web purchases, to be applied to companies making more than 20 per cent of their sales online, which he said would encourage retailers to focus on their bricks and mortar stores. “The internet is killing the high street. If you want to save the high street you have to address that,” he said. “You have to tax the web boys 20 per cent.” The retail tycoon said this would have a negative impact on his own company, but said it was necessary “for the good of the high street”. Mr Ashley bought House of Fraser out of administration earlier this year, and has vowed to save 80 per cent of the company’s stores. He also holds a significant stake in Debenhams and recently took over Evans Cycles. The committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, to which Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”He then added: “Before anybody says it, I’m not comparing myself to God.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Gennady Strekalov jettisoned and landed safely near the launch pad.We are psychologically and technically prepared for blast-off and any situation which, God forbid, may occur on board, said crew commander Kononenko in a news conference.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But they missed it the first time around, making it one of a number of objects that the team hopes to go back and have a proper look at.The rover already snapped a photo of the object, showing its shiny coating amid the dust and rocks of the Martian surface.But it will investigate it further with other tools in an attempt to understand its chemistry. That will be done using the onboard ChemCam, a set of tools that can examine objects remotely.In the same journey, it will have a look at a number of other interesting specimens. One very small piece is “Flanders moss”, which has an interesting, dark coloured coating which the team hope to come to understand by examining its chemistry.All of the work comes after Curiosity welcomed another visitor to the planet from Earth, the InSight rover. Curiosity played Mr Rogers’ song “Won’t You Be My Neighbour”\u0026nbspto welcome its fellow visitor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Chris Pine is on board to play Wonder Woman’s love interest.Release date: 7 July 2017. Yes, it is another Spider-Man reboot, having previously been redone with Andrew Garfield as the lead. However, this time it is part of the MCU, with Tom Holland as the titular character, and a heavily rumoured cameo by Iron Man could be in the pipeline. We can dream.Release date: 6 October 2017. In a strange announcement, Fox decided to withhold the release of Gambit until a future, as-yet unannounced date, which could be here, or this could be a completely separate project. Many suspect Deadpool 2 could nicely fit here, Fox capitalising on the success of the first film.Release date: 3 November 2017. Chris Hemsworth will be returning as the Norse God in his third solo MCU film. Flight of the Conchords’ Taika Waititi is on board to direct, and promises a fun adventure that will likely lead into Marvel’s next project, Infinity War.Release date: 17 November 2017. Hot on the heals of Thor comes Justice League Part One, the first DCEU team-up flick which will see Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg work together to fight bad guys.Release date: 12 January 2018. Kicking off 2018 will likely be the second Deadpool film, but then again, this could very well be another X-Men team-up. There’s also talk of an X-Force film, with Deadpool and other mutants teaming up to fight evil.Release date: 16 February 2018. The first non-white male-led superhero film in the MCU comes in the form of Black Panther, with Chadwick Boseman reprising the titular role, having also starred as the Panther in Civil War. Creed’s Ryan Coogler is on to direct what could be a very exciting film.Release date: 16 March 2018. The Flash will be the first DCEU film since Justice League, and sees Ezra Miller take the lead. Phil Lord and Chris Miller were supposed to pen the film before Disney snapped them up for the Han Solo-film, leaving Seth Grahame-Smith to take charge.Release date: 4 May 2018. And so, we finally get to the point of all these Infinity Stones! Thanos will be the big bad, with the Avengers needing to team up to defeat their biggest foe yet. It has previously been described as “the end of the Avengers as we know it”.1734 17. Ant-Man and The WaspRelease date: 6 July 2018. Peyton Reed will be back to direct this surprise sequel to one of the better received MCU films. While the name is ridiculous, at least Marvel are finally having a leading female superhero. Release date: 13 July 2018. Again, not much word on this one except it is thought to be X-Men spin-off New Mutants, something Josh Boone has been hit up to write.Release date: 20 July 2018. Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach, and Amy Pascal - the team behind the live-action Spider-Man films - are producing this ‘unrelated’ animated adaptation of the hero. Because you can never have too much Spider-Man, right?Release date: 27 July 2018. Another Justice League spin-off, Jason Momoa plays the leading man. Furious 7’s James Wan is on to direct, but little else is known about the film.Release date: 8 March 2019. We’ve hit 2019, and the first confirmed superhero film will be the first proper female-led MCU film. No-one is confirmed to be in the titular role of Carol Danvers just yet.Release date: 5 April 2019. Dwayne Johnson stars as the villain in this DCEU film which will be somewhat separate to the other DC films.Release date: 3 May 2019. The conclusion to the long drawn MCU saga. Expect a big finish with at least a few planets being destroyed.Release date: 14 June 2019. Soon after the Infinity War story reaches its conclusion, so will the Justice League’s. Not much is known, except Darkseid will likely be the villain for at least one of the parts.Release date: 12 July 2019. The concept of Inhumans (or Marvel’s mutants) has already been introduced in TV, through Marvel’s Agents of Shield, yet the film is expected to introduce the Royal Family who have yet to be seen in the show.Release date: 3 April 2020. Having debuted in Justice League Part One three years previously, Cyborg will finally be making his own outing, with Ray Fisher as the titular character.Release date: 1 May 2020. The first of three untitled Marvel films. There are a couple of contenders, the first is a likely sequel to Spider-Man with Sony, or a third s of the Galaxy film, thus finishing the trilogy.Release date: 19 June 2020. Before you start to worry, this has nothing to do with the Ryan Reynolds-starring flick that hit cinemas a little while ago. Instead, this will be another DCEU film that will likely spin-off from Justice League after the Green Lantern Corps cameo in one of the parts.Release date: 10 July 2020. As well as Spider-Man or s of the Galaxy sequels, a Doctor Strange or Black Panther one could fit in nicely here. Or perhaps Black Widow may finally get the solo-film she deserves.Release date: 6 November 2020. Some speculators also think a Blade film could fit in here, marking over 20 years since the first Blade. But many believe the character may be better suited to a Netflix series, as with Daredevil and Jessica Jones. There’s also talk of a Runaways film reaching cinemas at some stage.Release date: TBA. Now we’re onto the TBA release dates, the first of which is a Batman solo film, written and directed by Ben Affleck. When this is due, no one is quite sure but expect it sooner rather than later if Batman v Superman is a success. Release date: TBA (rumoured 2017). A sequel to Suicide Squad is expected to come in 2017 according to recent reports, but nothing has been confirmed. If the first is successful, it should come as no surprise for Warner Bros to rearrange their schedule to fit in this surefire hit.Release date: TBA. This is an odd one, as it has been confirmed Sony are wanting to release a Venom film completely unrelated to the upcoming Spider-Man reboot. Venom, as you may know, is a Spider-Man villain, intrinsically linked to Spider-Man, so it seems odd they would release a film unrelated to the rebooted project and not linked to the MCU.Well, now you mention it, there’s also that sequel to Fantastic Four that has seemingly been dropped by Fox. Plus, there’s the Gambit film which has been put on hold (but will likely fill an untitled Fox slot so we haven’t added it extra). Then again, it could be shoehorned in somehow…Release date: 6 May 2016. Iron Man and Captain America are set to face off in this superhero blockbuster that will feature nearly all the Avengers but won’t be an Avengers film. It will also mark the first time Spider-Man will feature in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with Sony having made a deal with Marvel Studios. Release date: 27 May 2016. Following the success of Days of Future Past, Apocalypse will follow the young X-Men team as the battle against Oscar Isaac’s titular villain as he gathers his four horsemen Magneto (Fassbender), Angel (Hardy), Storm (Shipp), and Psylocke (Munn). Expect carnage and no Wolverine. Release date: 5 August 2016. The first ‘supervillain’ film, Suicide Squad is also based in the DCEU (DC Extended Universe, where Batman and Superman live) and will introduce the world to Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn and Jared Leto’s Joker. One of the more exciting upcoming DC films that’s for sure.Release date: 4 November 2016. Benedict Cumberbatch will debut in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe, where Captain America and Iron Man live) as the Sorcerer Supreme. The film already has an incredible cast, including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachael McAdams and Tilda Swinton. Release date: 20 February 2017. Kicking off 2017 is the Lego version of Batman, who will lead his own spin-off, having already featured in the amazing Lego Movie.

Amendments have been tabled by two Labour MPs to extend the time for debate.\u0026nbspThere is also a significant amendment from Tory rebel Dominic Grieve, a former attorney general. It would give MPs a say on what happens next if the Brexit deal is voted down next week.\u0026nbspThe government absolutely does NOT want this to happen. Interestingly, it has been backed by 16 Tory MPs. Some are the usual rebels, like Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston but other signatories are surprising, such as Oliver Letwin and Nick Boles.\u0026nbspOne to watch.Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Commons he would support the government, although he did not agree with the dismissal of ancient procedures like the humble address being used to hold it to account.He said: I think it\u0027s right that a committee looks at this issue in broad terms because it may be right that the House wishes to take a self-denying ordinance on the extent of humble addresses.It may be right we would like to say specifically they would be deemed disorderly and therefore not brought forward if they related to matters concerning the security services.As the debate over the legal advice continues in the Commons,\u0026nbspthe debacle over another debate - a televised one between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May - has entered a new phase. This afternoon the Labour\u0027s leaders team has issued an ultimatum to the prime minister\u0027s team for a head-to-head debate.\u0026nbspA party spokesman said: When Number 10 told the media she wanted a head-to-head debate on her botched Brexit deal, Jeremy Corbyn immediately agreed. Jeremy Corbyn then swiftly accepted ITV\u0027s proposal for a straightforward head-to-head debate with Theresa May. But the Prime Minister has rejected it.Since then, the Prime Minister\u0027s team and their preferred broadcaster, the BBC, have put together a confused format which would limit head-to-head debating time, with a built-in advantage for the Government.The BBC\u0027s latest proposal is a mish-mash, with a lop-sided panel of other politicians and public figures, not a straightforward head-to-head debate. The BBC could - as ITV and Sky have proposed to do - fairly represent other viewpoints and parties in other programmes on its network.The public has a right to a genuine head-to-head debate on the Prime Minister\u0027s worst-of-all-worlds deal.Either Theresa May should accept ITV\u0027s straightforward proposal or - if she prefers the BBC - ask the corporation for a genuine head-to-head debate. Jeremy Corbyn is ready to take part in either.If the Prime Minister turns down the opportunity of a genuine head-to-head debate, it will be clear she is once again dodging a TV debate with the leader of the opposition on the future of our country.His remarks come after Number 10\u0026nbspaccused Mr Corbyn of running scared over the debate on Sunday. You can read more below.\u0026nbspFormer attorney general - and Tory Brexit rebel - Dominic Grieve says it is manifestly clear that the government has not complied properly with the terms of the motion.He says the attorney general is not to blame, he is acting on behalf of his client - eg the cabinet.However he said the method would apply not just to the Attorney General\u0027s advice, but to every piece of legal counsel given to the government during the EU negotiations.He told MPs: Some of it may undoubtedly contain confidential material which if put in the public domain could well jeopardise the national interest.The chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee said this was like the government being made to disclose the name of agents working for MI5 and MI6, adding the system was open to abuse.Back in the Commons, Nigel Dodds, of the DUP, praises the attorney general for telling the unvarnished truth in his devastating commentary yesterday.Apparently Mr Cox\u0026nbspsaid the deal was unattractive, unsatisfactory, undesirable in his speech. Parliament voted for this\u0026nbspadvice to be published - and the government cannot refuse to do so just because it wishes otherwise, Mr Dodds says.The government must respect the will of parliament and cannot just set it aside, he says.\u0026nbspSolicitor General Robert Buckland said the government had nothing to hide amid a row over the publication of the full legal guidance given to ministers about the Brexit deal.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s World At One: There\u0027s nothing to hide because the government has already published its legal position in full yesterday, the attorney general answered questions for two-and-a-half hours.I don\u0027t know what could be more full and frank in all honesty - there is nothing here now, other than a rather tawdry sideshow that is stopping us from getting on with debating the real issues about Brexit.He added: If the attorney general had come to parliament with the 10 commandments yesterday, that wouldn\u0027t have been enough: this is all a smokescreen and a ersion from actually what we should be talking about, which is what the public want to hear.The PM told Cabinet that the publication of the document setting out the legal position on Monday and the Attorney General\u0027s appearance in the Commons are by themselves extraordinary steps for any government to take.Theresa May\u0027s official spokesman said\u0026nbspthe government\u0027s amendment to the contempt motion would allow the privileges committee to look at the issue and consider the national interest arguments for not releasing the legal advice alongside the government\u0027s duty to parliament.On the article 50 case, her\u0026nbspspokesman said this is not a final judgment and it does nothing in any event to change the clear\u0026nbspposition of the government that article 50 is not going to be revoked.\u0026nbspJumping out of the debate for a moment - Independent political editor Joe Watts has been to the lobby briefing with No10.HMRC is contacting 145,000 UK export businesses to make sure they have the right kind of registration documents as they step up \u0027no deal\u0027 preparations.The decision was announced at cabinet this morning, at which ministers also discussed the decision not to publish the full legal advice relating to Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan.The PM\u0027s spokesman said the government would make available a sum in the low millions to ensure all of the business that would need an EORI number if no deal comes through, are contacted inidually and get one.It\u0027s entirely in keeping with taking the appropriate steps at the appropriate moment, he said. The appropriate moment at this point, being one in which the PM\u0027s deal looks increasingly under threat.The front bench is preparing for a late night tonight, with the contempt motion debate about to begin, potentially continuing until 7pm.Then the business motion relating to the broader debate on May\u0027s deal could potentially take another two hours, not to mention Dominic Grieve\u0027s amendment to it which is designed to allow the Commons to stop a no-deal withdrawal.That\u0027s all before before the actual debate on the withdrawal agreement - potentially lasting a further eight hours.Andrea Leadsom says the government considers the spirit and intention of the promise made in November has been fulfilled. Huge shouts from MPs at this comment.\u0026nbspShe completely rejects any suggestion Mr Cox has treated parliament with anything but respect. As the previous tweet says, Ms Leadsom is clearly conflating contempt with acting in a contemptuous manner. Contempt is a specific charge.\u0026nbspShe says: I appeal to members of this House that they refer this to the committee, in line with parliamentary procedures.\u0026nbspIt looks like the government is planning to stand firm.Tory MP Simon Hoare intervenes, saying opposition MPs had signed this motion by lunchtime yesterday - therefore they clearly had no interest in the attorney general\u0027s speech last night.\u0026nbspAndrea Leadsom\u0026nbspsays legal officers must be protected to allow government to function properly. She says the House could put the lives of troops in danger or compromise national security by demanding documents through this arcane procedure, known as a humble address.\u0026nbspKen Clarke, the Tory ex-chancellor, intervenes too. He says there is a sensible solution to overcome the party-political dispute\u0026nbspby giving a briefing to opposition leaders on privy council terms.\u0026nbspLeadsom thanks him but says that Labour want all information released\u0026nbspinto the public domain without thought to the consequences.\u0026nbspThis motion would compromise the ability of good government, she said. It is not in the interest of members or the national interest, she says.\u0026nbspLeadsom says: What we break now may be very difficult to fix later.Andrea Leadsom, the Commons leader, is now speaking for the government. She has tabled a motion to thwart the efforts, by forcing the matter to go before the privileges committee - ie kicking it into the long grass.She says the government has provided a lengthy commentary on the detailed legal position on the Brexit deal and the attorney general has promised to answer any questions MPs have.I would urge the house to exercise caution in this matter, she says. There is no dispute about the wording of the withdrawal agreement.She says no one could argue that the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, has done anything but treat the House with respect.Huge jeers from MPs when Keir Starmer says he has not taken this decision lightly.John Bercow, the Speaker,\u0026nbsphas to intervene to tell them to quieten down.Starmer urges the government to think again and pull back from the brink of being in contempt of parliament.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is now moving the contempt motion, on behalf of the opposition MPs.He says parliament\u0027s order on November 13 that the government publish the full legal advice on the Brexit deal was binding and the document published yesterday was simply a synopsis.The government is wilfully refusing to comply with a binding order of this house and that is contempt, he says.Starmer says the attorney general\u0027s reasoning behind not publishing was a plea of mitigation, not a defence - and it is not good enough.It is no longer a matter for the government to judge.

The court’s Advocate General this morning issued an opinion to that effect, and the court usually follows such\u0026nbspadvice.\u0026nbspIf confirmed, this would make a new referendum easier because a vote to remain in the EU could be implemented straight away – and our membership of the EU would continue under the existing terms, the UK rebate on contributions included.\u0026nbspUK ‘can cancel Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50’However, the UK government would still have to apply for an extension of the Article 50 deadline so that it could hold a referendum in the first place – and that would still need the unanimous agreement of the EU27 countries.\u0026nbspSome enthusiasts for a second referendum might think that the ECJ’s likely decision would allow the UK to cancel Brexit and then hold the referendum. But that would mean, if the vote were for Leave again, we would have to start the Article 50 process all over again. Which might fall foul of the Advocate General’s opinion, which says that revocation of Article 50 notice is allowed provided it “does not involve an abusive practice”. Revoking and invoking our notice might be seen by the ECJ as precisely that: an illegitimate negotiating tactic.\u0026nbspIf the UK asks for more time to hold a referendum, the\u0026nbspEU27\u0026nbspare highly likely to agree to an extension to the timetable.So the significance of this opinion is indirect. It makes a possible referendum simpler because it would present a choice between two definite options: Theresa May’s Brexit deal versus remaining in the EU on existing terms.\u0026nbspThat would take away one of the arguments against a second referendum, namely that, if “Remain” were on the ballot paper, it would not be possible to guarantee what it meant because – without this legal opinion – we would need to ask permission of the EU27 to stay in the EU. That would probably be granted, but it might be complicated to secure an agreement to that effect before a referendum.\u0026nbspIn the next few days, as MPs debate the prime minister’s Brexit deal, the advocates of giving the people the final say can therefore propose a new referendum that seems credible and well defined.\u0026nbspThey know that, if the UK asks for more time to hold a referendum, the EU27 are highly likely to agree to an extension to the timetable. They want us to stay and want to make it easy for us to do so.\u0026nbspHowever, that EU law is interpreted in a way that suits the cause of integration – “ever closer union” in the words of the founding treaty – does reinforce the argument of Leavers that the EU will always seek to become a single superstate.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is a real risk that if we don’t vote for this deal that there may be a majority in the House of Commons for a second referendum. And there is also the risk that if we don’t vote for this deal we may get a less good deal, or no deal at all. All of those are less attractive than this deal.“I actually think if there were a second referendum people would probably vote to Leave in even larger numbers than they did before. But the very act of calling a second referendum, I believe, would damage faith in democracy and rip apart the social fabric of this country.”Pressed on the Northern Ireland “backstop” – the EU’s insurance policy to avoid a hard border – Mr Gove said however “uncomfortable” it is for the UK, “it is more uncomfortable for the European Union”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

Excavators were seen working on the Israeli side of the border on Tuesday after an army spokesperson said an effort had begun to “thwart and neutralise” the tunnels before they became operational. The move is likely to raise tensions along the disputed Israel-Lebanon border, which has been relatively quiet since the last devastating flare-up of violence in 2006. Over the past few years, Syria has become the primary battleground for the historic foes. Hezbollah, a powerful Shia militant group and political party with a presence in the Lebanese parliament, has sent thousands of fighters to support its ally President Bashar al-Assad. Israel, meanwhile, has carried out frequent air strikes in Syria\u0026nbspto prevent the supply of weapons from Iran to its ally Hezbollah. But as that conflict has wound down, both sides appear to be increasingly turning their attention to Lebanon. Israel views Hezbollah as an existential threat due to its close relationship with Iran, and has made repeated threats to invade Lebanon to tackle the group. Hezbollah\u0026nbspjustifies its arms as a necessary deterrence against Israeli invasion. Israel criticised for picture of F-35 stealth jet flying over BeirutIsrael has watched with concern as Hezbollah has emerged from the Syrian war significantly stronger. Thousands of its fighters have gained valuable battlefield experience, and the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, claims to have built up an arsenal of longer-range and more accurate missiles than when it last fought Israel in 2006. Speaking last year, he said there would be “no place that is out of reach of the rockets of the resistance or the boots of the resistance fighters.”The group has made no secret of its extensive tunnel network in southern Lebanon, which it says is to deter Israel from attacking. In 2015, a report by Lebanese newspaper As-Safir, known for its pro-Hezbollah stance, published a detailed report on the group expanding its tunnel-building efforts. Many of those tunnels are built inside Lebanon, in anticipation of an Israeli invasion. Israel, too, has been making preparations for a future conflict. In addition to striking Iranian targets in Syria to prevent arms supplies to Hezbollah, earlier this year it began building a large wall along the border, which has never been internationally recognised. And as recently as September, the Israeli army conducted large-scale drills in northern Israel simulating a conflict with Hezbollah.Given Hezbollah has a history of digging tunnels in southern Lebanon, it wouldn\u0027t be a surprise if they were using a tried and true tactic that has shown some success\u0026nbspBoth sides have a history of using public threats as a means of deterrence, and of preparing for war in times of peace. But analysts said there was little risk of a major conflagration at this moment. \u0026nbsp“Given Hezbollah has a history of digging tunnels in southern Lebanon, it wouldn\u0027t be a surprise if they were using a tried and true tactic that has shown some success,” said Phillip Smyth, a fellow at the Washington Institute and a researcher on Shia armed groups.“It wouldn\u0027t be a shock if Hezbollah were planning something. However, even with their advancements in Syria, they seem to be taking things quite slowly,” he added.In a briefing to journalists, Israeli army spokesman Jonathan Conricus said the tunnels constituted a flagrant and severe violation of Israeli sovereignty. He added that an anti-tunnel task force has been operating for more than four years, and spent a year and half preparing for this operation.Later on Tuesday, the Israeli army announced it had destroyed one tunnel, which it said was dug 25 meters underground and ran from an area to the south of the Lebanese village of Kfar Kala into Israeli territory.

Col Conricus claimed that the underground passage was a part of \u0026nbspthe “surprise component” of Hezbollah’s plan to infiltrate Israel and attack civilians or soldiers. \u0026nbsp“We hold the Lebanese government responsible for all of these activities,” he added. The Israeli operation began hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Brussels, in which the two discussed ways to halt together Iranian aggression in the region. The administration of President Donald Trump has taken a significantly more aggressive stance towards Iran and Hezbollah than his predecessor. \u0026nbspMr Netanyahu, who is also acting defence minister, is currently mired in a corruption scandal at home, which has led some to question the timing of the operation. MK Yoel\u0026nbspHasson, chair of the opposition Zionist Union, accused Netanyahu of cheapening the Israeli army.\u0026nbspThe bulldozer operation in Israeli territory leaves us no alternative but to question the timing and presentation of the operation, he said.\u0026nbsp“In the end the main reason is strategic and not political,” Amos Harel, defence expert and writer for left-leaning Israeli daily Haaretz, told The Independent. \u0026nbsp“But it might come in as useful, as the discussion moves towards policy and strategic threat and not politics and corruption.”The last major battle between the two sides was sparked by a cross-border raid by Hezbollah in 2006 to kidnap two Israeli soldiers. Hezbollah had hoped to use the soldiers as to pressure Israel to release Lebanese prisoners, but it instead prompted a devastating Israeli attack that led to the deaths of more than 1,000 Lebanese civilians. Forty-four Israeli civilians were also killed by Hezbollah rockets. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHezbollah was founded in the early 1980s with the support of Iran, and spent much of its early existence fighting Israeli troops who were occupying southern Lebanon.Israel invaded Lebanon numerous times during the country\u0027s 1975-1990 civil war, and occupied much of the south of the country for some 22 years. During the occupation, Hezbollah dug extensive tunnel networks across the south of the country and used them to launch ambushes and move around unseen by Israeli jets. Today, it is possible for tourists to visit one part of that tunnel network, which has been preserved in a museum near the town of Mleeta. Hezbollah declined to comment when contacted by The Independent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They could then decide which to make public.The humble address was passed unanimously as the Tories sensed defeat and so called on its MPs not to attend the vote to save face.Keir Starmer said he expected ministers to release the studies as a result.“Labour has been absolutely clear since the referendum that ministers could not withhold vital information from parliament about the impact of Brexit on jobs and the economy,” he said.“It’s completely unacceptable for the Tories to have wasted months avoiding responsible scrutiny and trying to keep the public in the dark. The reality is that it should not have taken an ancient parliamentary procedure to get ministers to listen to common sense.“As the Speaker has made clear, the government cannot ignore [the] binding decision. [Brexit Secretary] David Davis must now respond to parliament’s ruling and urgently set a date for when he will share these papers.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000402655327-e1528307444665.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"what brexit backstop plan theresa may eu irish border latest","story":"Heres our guide to the plan and what it means for Northern Ireland and its border with the Republic of Ireland.The backstop plan is essentially a safety netthere is no Brexit trade deal.It would avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The backstop will see Britain remain in the customs union for as long as necessary until an alternative way of keeping the border open is found.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , EU leaders approved an agreement on the UKs withdrawal from the EU.MPs will now be asked to approve the agreement when it comes before the House of Commons next week.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has been ordered to publish all the legal advice hes given Mrs May on her proposed deal - but has only handed over a summary instead.It concluded the proposed backstop would stop Britain making trade deals around the world in a separate legal document.Addressing the issue of the backstop - which will keep Britain in the customs uniontheres no other way to protect the Irish border - the Attorney General said: There is no unilateral right for either party to terminate this arrangement.This means thatno superseding agreement can be reached within the implementation period, the protocol would be activated and in international law would subsist, evennegotiations had broken down.How likely that is to happen is a political question, to which the answer will no doubt depend partly on the extent to which it is in either partys interests to remain indefinitely within its arrangements.We are indefinitely committing to itit came into force. There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000452642824.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"no10 need more time to tell whether full on no deal preparation is necessary","story":"This was the moment at which the principal purpose of government was meant to sht to getting this country ready for leaving the EU, regardless of whether there was deal or not.The Department For Exiting The EU wanted November  but No argued that a more vague deadline of late November  early December was better.They thought that this would give more time to tell whether full-on “no-deal” preparation was necessary or not.But now No  is indicating that it wants to hold off until after the meaningful vote in Parliament on December .This is deeply irresponsible.Those inside the machine estimate that it would take four months of intense preparations to get this country into a place where it could make no deal manageable.So, by waiting until after the meaningful vote, the Government is denying itself valuable time.I am told that new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay, who will update Cabinet on no-deal preparedness on Tuesday, is frustrated at the foot- dragging by No . A growing number of other ministers share this concern.Theresa May, of course doesn’t want no deal. She wants Parliament to approve the deal she has negotiated.But, right now, it is hard to see how it passes.The DUP have said they won’t vote for it, denying the Government its majority, and  Tory MPs have declared they will vote against it — ­suggesting the Government is on course for a heavy defeat.“It is increasingly dficult to see what rescues this,” said one of those charged with getting it through.Given thatthe withdrawal agreement is defeated and nothing is put in its place then this country leaves the EU without a deal, it is foolish not to massively intensy planning for that outcome.At every point since the ­referendum, the Government has put off crucial decisions on no-deal planning.This has weakened the UK’s negotiating position and means the UK is now ill-prepared for what Mrs May admits is one of the three most likely outcomes.The situation is so serious that one member of the Privy Council told me this week that the military should be drafted in to help.This former Cabinet minister’s argument was that only the military had the logistical know-how to ensure that ­critical supplies make it all around the country in time.May still hasn’t given up on getting the withdrawal agreement through Parliament.But there is little sign of a decisive sht in her favour.Cabinet ministers are still talking in terms of the scale of defeat, rather than of victory.The expectation among ­ministers is thatMay loses the vote by  or less, she will seek clarication on the ­backstop and then try and bring it back to the Commons.But, as one leading member of the Cabinet warns, May will have to move fast.If she loses the meaningful vote she “could face the  letters and a vote of no confidence in short order”.THE Housing Secretary, James Brokenshire, has scored a ­signicant victory over the Chancellor.Brokenshire wanted to reduce the maximum deposit that renters would have to pay from six weeks’ rent to five.The idea was that this would be fairer on tenants who must find the money for the deposit up front. But Philip Hammond objected.The Chancellor wrote to Cabinet colleagues that “I cannot agree to the proposed concession to lower the deposit cap from six weeks’ rent to five weeks’ rent.“Six weeks’ rent was already placing landlords at risk of uncovered loss for damage to property, as well as risk of loss of rent.“This bill was always a high- risk measure. A cap of six weeks’ rent was already a major concession and I believe we have to hold the line at this level.”However, Hammond’s objections have not carried the day. The Government will now back reducing the deposit cap to five weeks for all but the most expensive properties.One of the Tories’ biggest problems is being seen as the landlords’ party.

This would result in a narrow defeat for Theresa May.At that point, the Fixed Term Parliament Act allows  days for the Commons to approve an alternative government.In these circumstances, no government could be approved – the DUP wouldn’t actively put ­Corbyn into No  while no Tory leader could be elected in that time who would meet the DUP’s requirements on the backstop.The result of all this would be that with ­Parliament deadlocked, there would have to be another General Election.How realistic the Labour front bench consider this scenario is crucial. For there is mounting tension in the Shadow Cabinet about whether or not Labour should formally back a second referendum.At the moment, Labour’s policy is to push for a General Election above all .But this week, John McDonnell – the Shadow Chancellor – admitted that securing a General Election was “very dficult” so the party may well back a second referendum instead.TORY party donors have received a letter from party HQ defending the deal that Theresa May has ­negotiated.Attached to the letter is a rather revealing document setting out why “the backstop is needed in all scenarios”.It lists four future scenarios for UK EU relations – a Canada-style trade deal, EEA membership, a UK EU customs union and the UK being in both the customs union and the single market.Three of these four options would be deemed unacceptable by most Brexiteer MPs.WHEN the then Culture Secretary Matt Hancock scrapped Leveson , the next stage of the inquiry into the Press, critics claimed that either Parliament or the courts would force him into a U-turn.But the key votes in the Commons were won, and this week the courts rejected the appeal for a judicial review of the decision.With Labour having gone cold on Section , which would have forced newspapers to sign up to a state regulator or pay both sides’ costs in disputes, the freedom of the Press remains.The challenge now is never to allow it to be threatened in this way again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That weakness has been exploited time after time by EU negotiators.If only they shared the faith of those who voted for a brighter future.The scandalous lack of planning for a clean break, as James Forsyth makes clear on this very page, is a result of the Government only ever looking for pitfalls — rather than grabbing the opportunities that are so obviously out there for a reinvigorated Britain.It’s not too late. If the PM loses the crunch vote in Parliament, we must step up preparations to leave without a deal by several notches.And that might well see Brussels bureaucrats, for all their harsh words, coming back to the negotiating table.The disgraced tycoon Max Mosley, via his family trust, has pledged to keep funding this so-called independent body for years to come, as he continues his vendetta against the free Press.Labour donor Mr Mosley is no fan of the papers, and not just for exposing his extra-curricular activities. The media also uncovered his racist past, including pamphlets warning: “Coloured immigration threatens your children’s health.”When that bile came to light, the Labour Party promised not to take another penny from him.

We must be duly punished.EU leaders can see — apparently more clearly than our own abject leaders — just how well we might do and how much of a threat a prosperous, independent Britain would pose to their Grand Project.Nobody can be certain what will happen after next Tuesday’s crunch vote.A snap election or a second referendum are unthinkable but possible.Returning to full EU membership is both unthinkable and impossible.There are alternatives... the Norway Option, Canada Plus... but they are fraught with complications.Yet there is a way we could avoid Mr Gove’s “turbulence” and leave in an orderly fashion without any deal at all.We don’t have to “crash out” or drive off a clf like Thelma and Louise.Neither option would be good for Britain — or the EU.It should be possible to negotiate a  to -month window to prepare a deal which suits both sides — and pay an appropriate sum to Brussels for the extra time.First, of course, we need a new leader and a new Prime Minister.That is almost as complicated as Brexit.DISGRACED Labour MP Kate Osamor has finally quit Jeremy Corbyn’s team, but only after proof she lied about knowing her son Ishmael was a convicted drug handler.Ms Osamor told a Times reporter who confronted her with the evidence: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in.”“F*** off,” she added and chucked a bucket of water.Two questions. Is it any surprise Ishmael grew up with contempt for the law And what would have happened to a Tory MP who behaved like that to ahack Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Most are keen and eager to learn. That’s why teaching can be a really rewarding job, but there’s no doubt it is also a tough one.Today I will be launching my annual report, which will show that, overall, schools in England are doing a good job.The vast majority of children are attending good or outstanding schools, which is as it should be. Young people get just one shot at childhood — leaving no room for complacency.Yet in recent years it feels like more and more is being asked of schools and teachers, which could put this improvement at risk.They are being asked to do things that should be done at home by parents, as they used to be.This is making the job of schools harder. It takes up too much precious time and stops teachers from doing their actual job — teaching.One of the most shocking examples I hear about is the growing number of children beginning their reception year still in nappies.I’ve asked about this in primary schools this year, and each time I’ve asked I’ve been told it is a real problem.This is dficult for teachers, embarrassing for the children concerned and disruptive to their classmates.Quite simply, it is wrong. Toilet training is the parents’ job. It should not be left to schools. Only in the most extreme cases should parents be excused from this most basic of parenting tasks.And this isn’t the only area that concerns me.We all know about the growing problem of childhood obesity. By the start of primary school, almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This is at the age four or five.This rises to more than a third by the time they go to secondary school.It is estimated that nearly , young people in the UK are now suffering from type  diabetes, an unpleasant disease normally only seen in people over the age of .Schools have an important role to play, teaching children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise. Kids need to get out of breath during PE.But schools can’t do it all. It is lazy for us to rely on schools to change kids’ habits.And the reality is, that as Ofsted research shows, schools on their own can’t make the dference. The answer to the obesity crisis, particularly among younger children, lies in the home, and parents need to make sure their offspring eat healthily, go outside, and don’t spend all day playing on electronic devices.There is no point in teaching about healthy choices, making sure school meals are healthy or having rules about what goes into a packed lunch,for breakfast, dinner and all weekend children have a supply of junk food.One of the saddest things I’ve heard about recently is cases where children have leftover fast food, cold chips or chicken nuggets, in their packed lunches the following day. With the best will in the world, schools cannot fight this single-handedly.Sadly, in some parts of our country, schools are also at the forefront of tackling a very dferent kind of risk: kne crime and gang culture.Thankfully most schools are safe, and of course they can help educate young people about the dangers of knives and how to avoid being drawn into gangs.But they cannot be expected to solve the problem alone. Preventing kne crime requires people working together — police, youth services, health services — to protect children and to do everything to bring those who cause harm to children to justice.However we must not forget the role of parents here either. This is about taking responsibility for your child. I accept that many families are busy and that some children have dficult and complex problems to deal with.But that doesn’t excuse parents from the basics of teaching their children right from wrong, giving them proper boundaries and security. And that means not trying to be their “best friend”.One answer may be to introduce more parenting classes. We know these can work and help parents who might otherwise be struggling.These shouldn’t be for schools to run, but perhaps to run in schools. Maybe now is the time to look again at the ambitions of the Le Chances strategy or the ideas behind the Sure Start programme.But parents must recognise they cannot off load their responsibilities at the school gate.Every minute we ask teachers to spend on these issues is time children aren’t learning the Rs, studying our nation’s history or the scientic forces that shape our world.I want schools to be able to do their proper job, and to let them do that, parents have got to step up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She doesn’t, she’s on public display and when you’re on public display   there’s a certain way of behaving.”Piers added: “You can’t go after a prince as she did. And I know she did.

They rise effortless and regally above it all.The queen is the most revered person in the world you could argue and she’s done so by saying nothing in public and behaving like a royal.”Ms Sanghani said: “But what Meghan is doing is inspiring a generation and being dferent and being fresh and I’m a massive fan.”Piers added: “Well she didn’t inspire me, she sacked me like a sack of spuds.

In a scathing report on the problems caused when new schedules came into effect in May, the Transport Select Committee said he should have done more to prevent it.He told BBC Radio s Today programme that several reports had identied failings, adding: Clearly we did not ask tough enough questions. The reality is, at no point did I get the information I would have needed to intervene and we must make sure that never happens again and I absolutely accept responsibility for my department and myself not asking the tough enough questions. The Committee said the chaotic rollout of alterations to services across the country should be the catalyst for genuine change for people who rely on the railways. Mr Grayling had the ultimate authority to judge trade-offs between competing commercial interest and he should have been more proactive, said the report. The committee said passengers most affected by the delays and cancellations should receive a discount on  tickets. Last weeks announcement that rail fares will increase by an average of .% added insult to passengers injury, said Lilian Greenwood, who chairs the committee.  She said: It is extraordinary, and totally unacceptable, that no-one took charge of the situation and acted to avert the May timetabling crisis. Instead of experiencing the benefits of much-needed investment in our railways, around one in five passengers experienced intensely inconvenient and costly disruption to their daily lives. There was extraordinary complacency about protecting the interests of passengers, who were very badly let down. The complex system by which we operate our rail services failed to cope with the scale of change planned for May. The Secretary of State has announced a year-long independent rail review. While the need for fundamental reform is beyond doubt, passengers cannot wait until  for key lessons to be learned and reforms implemented. National rail timetabling need genuinely independent oversight, located outside Network Rail, to avoid being affected by commercial and political pressure, said the committee.  All passengers affected by the May timetabling disruption were badly let down by the system, but people with sensory, mobility and other impairments were disproportionately affected, said the report, adding: This is clearly unacceptable. As a matter of urgency industry and the Office of Rail and Roadmust take steps to ensure such a situation does not arise again. The report said the disruption led to a prolonged period of inconvenient, costly and potentially dangerous disruption for passengers across the north of England, London and the south. There was a collective, system-wide failure across Network Rail, the train operators, Transport Department and the ORR, and nobody took charge, said the MPs. Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: This devastating report lays the blame clearly on the disastrous fragmentation of our railways and with Chris Grayling. He was asleep at the wheel of a broken, fragmented, over-complicated system that is solely of his partys creation. He has presided over a collective systemic failure and passengers deserve nothing less than his resignation. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: Its an inescapable fact that the complexity of the British rail system is one of the primary reasons why it was so easy for senior figures across the railway to pass the buck ahead of the new timetables introduction in May.  Meaningful reform of the system is impossible under the current rail structure supported by the Conservatives. The committee is correct to say that Chris Grayling could have done more and should take greater responsibility for the chaos in May. Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers union Aslef, said: The Transport Secretary,he had any sense of embarrassment or responsibility, would do the decent thing and resign after this damning report. He wont, of course. Everything is always someone s fault, as far as hes concerned. The truth is we dont want, or need, reform. We need a radical solution to the problem. We need to bring our railways back into public ownership - a promise Labour has made to the electorate - and run our railway as a public service, not for private profit. A Department for Transport spokesman said: We have already worked with the industry to deliver special compensation schemes on Northern, TransPennine Express and GTR, which provides the equivalent of up to % of the cost of an annual season ticket for those most severely impacted. The disruption following the May timetable change demonstrated that signicant change is required in the rail industry. That is why we launched the Williams review to consider all parts of the industry in order to put passengers first, with reforms to begin from . Patrick Verwer, chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway, said: We are very sorry for the disruption the May timetable caused and have already processed compensation claims for , season ticket holders, with the deadline for claims extended to  January . Since July, services on Thameslink and Great Northern have become more stable and reliable. Next week we will begin to introduce  mainly off-peak services to complete the phased roll-out of the May weekday timetable, bringing the total number of daily weekday services to ,. Alex Hayman of consumer group Which  said: The report provides yet more evidence that no-one took responsibility for fixing the timetable mess and that blame for the appalling delays, cancellations and lack of information endured by passengers goes right to the top.

Alice Muir was so ashamed of her “mountain-sized” spots that she would spend almost two hours covering them up with foundation, before events like her work Christmas party. The -year-old wouldnt even let her own family see her without a full face of make-up as she was so self-conscious. But after years of hunting for a cure - trying everything from antibiotics to expensive specialised potions - in May this year Alice, of Edinburgh, Scotland, combined a diet overhaul with a high street toner and within six weeks her skin was completely clear. Alice, who works for a luxury beauty retailer and now has a pimple-free complexion, said: “People honestly don’t believe it’s me now when I show them my ‘before’ photos.   “My acne was all over my face and was bright red and sore all the time. “I like to show customers who are having issues with their skin, to make them see that they’re not alone and things do get better.” Alice, who is single, was battling with cystic acne - the most severe form of the spotty skin condition, which occurs when oil and dead skin cells build up deep within hair follicles, causing a rash of infected boils. Ironically, it was training for the job she loves so much that triggered her problems when, after leaving school, aged , she started studying make-up artistry at Edinburgh College - practising the looks she had been taught at home, using heavy make-up on her own face. “I was practising at home at least three nights a week, applying really heavy make-up, so I could then take photos and post them on my social media, to show what Id done,” she said.   “I’d apply foundation, concealer, powder, bronzer, blusher and highlighter, before Id even added my eye make-up.” Until then, Alice had been blessed with clear skin and, preferring a natural look, to being heavily made-up, she was often complimented on her fresh complexion. “People would ask me, ‘Why don’t you have any spots ’. Most people of  did, but I didn’t seem to have any problems,” she said. That all changed a month into her new course, when she noticed blemishes popping up and her pores opening - making her skin more prone to break-outs. Recalling how the blemishes became bigger and angrier, she continued: “They were actually under the skin, so I couldn’t pop them. They were just there, like mountains on my face. Alice was even more mortied at college, when her fellow students had to make her face up for her, and started to wear cover-up all the time.   “Not even my own family saw me without a full-face of make-up when the acne got really bad,” she said. “It would take me up to one-and-a-half hours every day to just put my full face on. Her doctor prescribed a series of lotions, creams and antibiotics, in a bid to improve her skin, following her cystic acne diagnosis, aged , but nothing seemed to work. “I realised it was the make-up I was applying on my course that had started the terrible acne, but there seemed to be nothing I could do about it,” she recalled. When she landed her current job, following her two-year course, Alice felt ashamed of her acne-covered skin when she was applying clients make-up and helping them to choose expensive skincare products. She said: “I was supposed to be advising people on how to care for their skin and which make-up to use, but they must have been looking at me thinking, ‘Sort out your own skin before giving me advice’.   “No one ever said that to me, but I was sure that was what they were thinking. The terrible thing was there was nothing I could do about it.” On a long waiting list to see a dermatologist and refusing to take the strong acne drug Roaccutane, which slows down the amount of oil your skin releases but according to the NHS can also have a serious side effect of depression, Alice felt helpless. “I knew I had to do something. I was desperate and felt horrendous about myself,” she said. “I didn’t want to go out and dreaded events like the work Christmas party or my graduation, as I didn’t want people looking at me. “I hated looking in the mirror and didn’t recognise the girl looking back at me, I felt disgusting.” So, in May this year, Alice decided to take the issue into her own hands.   After being given a sample at work of the brand REN’s Ready Steady Glow Daily AHA Tonic, Alice says she noticed a change in her skin just a week after using it. As well as using the pound skincare treatment every night, Alice also overhauled her diet, cutting down on carbohydrates and following a ‘clean eating’ plan, eating mainly plant-based foods. Now, six months on, Alice’s skin is beautully clear, without a pimple in sight. Before she was cured Alice had not even allowed her family to see her spotty skin barefaced, but now she is releasing her photos in a bid to raise awareness about adult and cystic acne. She said: “It can happen to anyone, and it’s not because you’re not clean or you don’t wash. “At the work Christmas party this year, I won’t feel ashamed of how I look. Instead, I’ll feel proud of how far I’ve come, and, who knows, I might even get a cheeky kiss under the mistletoe.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles great great great","story":"NewsMeghan Markles great-great-great grandmother used to work in the kitchens at Windsor CastleIt seems a passion for cooking may run in Meghan Markles family, as it has recently been revealed that one of her relatives once prepared meals for royaltyShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  DEC NewsMeghan Markles relative also enjoyed cooking \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailUntil now, we thought Meghan Markle only became associated with Britains most famous family when she met Prince Harry in .

But it turns out the Duchess of Sussexs connection to the royals spans more than  years - and its all because of her great-great-great grandmother, Mary Bird.Meghans relatives have previously claimed Mary worked at Windsor Castle as a maid, but it has now come to light that she was in fact a cook.  According to a database of Royal Household staff, there was a worker named M. Bird, who appeared in the Windsor Castle Weekly Disbursement Book in .This was around the same time Mary would have been in the UK, reports The Express.Meghans great-great-great grandmother later married Thomas Bird, an Irish shoemaker who served as an officer in the British Army. Her family disowned her for this and so the couple decided to move to Malta with the Army, where they started a family in .  They had two children together, including Meghans great-great grandmother, who was also named Mary. The family went on to spend the next  years living in Malta, but after her husband died, Mary and the children migrated to Canada, before moving to Meredith and finally settling in New Hampshire. Mary is thought to be connected to Meghan on her fathers side of the family.  While Marys role at the castle was of great contrast to Meghans newfound royal status, it seems that the two relatives both share a passion for cooking. The Duchess of Sussex has been pictured baking and cooking several times since her royal wedding.During her tour of Australia and New Zealand she made a loaf of banana bread for guests at a picnic and has also worked on a cookbook with the Hubb Community Kitchen to raise funds for those affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy. Interest in Meghans ancestry comes after photos of the Duchess visiting Malta in March  surfaced online. The trip, which reportedly included visits to towns such as Mdina, Valletta, Victoria and Dwerja, allowed Meghan to learn more about her family history. Speaking at the time, she said: This trip was mostly about trying to understand where I come from, my identity. There is something so lovely about fitting in a piece of the puzzle.

Teachers at St Helen and St Katherine in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, were being gted Mulberry handbags and gt vouchers for meals at top restaurants. School bosses decided to step in as they claim the generous presents put staff in an awkward position, reports the Times. They have therefore asked all parents to stick to the limit and theyve also put a pound cap on all group presents. According to teachers on the parenting website Mumsnet, the normal price tag for teacher gts is between pound and pound.   The policy has been in place for a number of years but a letter was sent out to clary the rules. The independent schools Bursar David Eley said: As a charitable organisation we are obliged to have a policy in this area to ensure strong governance. Our staff policy has been in place for a number of years and no concerns have ever arisen over this matter. We have issued a letter to parents to provide clarity and to prevent placing staff or parents in an awkward position. We have a great relationship with our parent body and a powerful sense of community which is built on this kind of transparency clarity. The school, which was attended by Samantha Cameron, has fees of pound, a term. However the decision has been criticised by Janita Gray, senior editor at the Good School Guide, who is concerned it may make parents feel pound is the normal rate for a present. Many teachers believe even pound would be far too much to spend, with one writing on Mumsnet: Id be mortiedevery parent thought they had to spend pound on me, over the class that would be pound. The thing I appreciate most is a note in the Xmas card to say their child is happy and settled.

Megan Firth, , was just  when she was diagnosed with Kleine-Levin syndrome- a complex neurological disorder, involving recurring periods of excessive sleep, altered behaviour and a reduced understanding of the world. She often stays in a deep sleep for  hours without waking. And this year while her family is celebrating the festivities, she is likely to be found in bed. At her worst Megan, who lives with her younger brother, Jamie, , accountant mum Emma, , and logistics director dad, Andrew, , in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, has spent months more or less bed-bound - rising only to eat and use the bathroom.  The Nottingham University student, who says her excessive sleeping - known as hypersomnolence - is worse in the winter months, said: This means Im often asleep right through Christmas. We are always at home and my grandmas tend to come and stay with us. But evenI am in the middle of a sleep episode, I like to at least be around them all and sleep downstairs on the sofa. They are all pretty used to it by now and know not to bother me, as I can become very panicked when Im woken up in the middle of a long sleep. While her condition is dubbed Sleeping Beauty syndrome, at university she feels more like the fairy tale character Cinderella as she has to leave student gatherings before midnight, to avoid triggering her KLS. She explained: Its quite dficult because you can really feel like youre missing out, when all these new friends are going out until late each night and you have to be back in bed before midnight. Luckily, I have made some really great friends who have been very understanding, but I still have to think about it all the time, otherwise,I stay up too late, I can trigger another episode and become bedridden for several weeks.  Megans first experience with KLS came, aged , when a nasty case of flu brought on extreme fatigue and a brain fog that left the schoolgirl not being able to tell the dference between dreams and reality. I was ill in bed, but then on the second or third day, I became very disorientated, as though I was in a waking dream, she said. As I later found out, this is a classic symptom of the disorder, called de-realisation, and was the precursor of things to come. Following a week with flu, then sleeping for the entire day - only rising to eat and use the toilet - Megans anxious parents took her to the John Radclfe Hospital in Oxford. But test results were negative and, told her drowsiness was most likely due to a particularly virulent strain of flu, when it eventually wore off after six weeks, she went back to her school studies. Then, a month later, the fatigue ed when Megan, who had just turned , had travelled alone to Brisbane, Australia, to visit family friends.  Again, the strange sense of being trapped in a dream ed, accompanied by terrible headaches, which preceded an overwhelming desire to sleep. No matter how long I slept for, I still felt tired when I woke up, as though I had only been asleep for half an hour, when actually I had been in bed for  hours, said Megan. Worried sick, after Megan had slept for almost two weeks, her mum flew out to be with her. By this stage my mum and dad were very worried and thought I might have a brain tumour, because the doctors I saw had no idea what it could be, Megan recalled. But then one day my mum was up late Googling my symptoms and Kleine-Levin popped up. It seemed to match perfectly with what I was experiencing, so she suggested it to the doctors in Queensland Childrens Hospital, where I was being treated, who agreed. The diagnosis was confirmed by doctors at the John Radclfe Hospital, who said they had never before encountered the condition which, according to a review published by the Kleine-Levin Syndrome Foundation affects only one person in every million.   Megan continued: I realised that it would be le-changing, but I felt reassured that I wasnt going mad and that I didnt have some awful disease thatd kill me - I knew I could live with it. Sometimes experiencing bouts of sleepiness as often as every few weeks during the next couple of years, Megan had little energy to do more than study, eat and sleep. She explained: KLS has meant sacricing a lot. I played county cricket for Oxfordshire, but I found that I couldnt keep that up and do my school work, because I was just losing so much time sleeping. It even affected our family holidays, as one of my triggers is flying, so we had to drive around Europe when we went away. In spite of losing months of classroom time to her condition, astonishingly, Megan landed a university place a year early - starting her studies at Nottingham Uni when she was just . Now approaching the end of her first term there, she has only had two slumbering spells - each lasting a couple of weeks - since she started and her fellow students and tutors have been very understanding.  She said: I have to think about it a lot and be careful to make sure everyone at uni knows that I have this problem. All of my friends are very aware of it, and so is the university, who give me longer to hand in my essays and extra time in exams. The worry is that one day I could fall asleep and never wake up, so I text my mum every morning to tell her Im awake andI dont, shell ring one of my friends and ask them to wake me up. It isnt ideal and sometimes it does upset me, thinking about all the stuff I miss out on because of KLS. But, then again, I feel really proud to have got into a good university in spite of it all and in many ways I dont think Id have achieved so muchI didnt have the illness. It pushed me to succeed and now Im determined to live a normal le.

Depending on the size of your appetite, some people will be able to eat a whole burger in one sitting, while others may struggle to finish it. The latter would probably be amazed to meet -year-old social media star Kate Ovens, who just polished off a whopping oz burger - and captured the accomplishment on film for all to see.  Kate, a food blogger from Kennington in south London, is well-known for taking on epic food challenges and her latest took place at Libertine Burger in Leamington Spa. The restaurant created an absolute monstrosity of a meal for the petite blogger, made up of nine beef burger patties, cheese, salad and gherkins, all encased in a seeded bun. This was of course accompanied by a generous side of fries. Before taking on the challenge, Kate revealed she was feeling a little apprehensive about the food in front of her, but nonetheless was excited to get stuck in.  She said: I am at Libertine Burger in Leamington Spa and they have created this absolute monstrosity of a thing, which I think is nine patties. I found these guys at the National Burger Awards and they make an excellent burger, would definitely recommend you come down.

I can feel all the meat, she explained. I feel like its coming out through my cheeks. Carrying on, Kate managed to tackle the gigantic feast, clearing the entire tray in a total of  minutes.

The -year-old models Masha and Dasha Ledeneva were rushed to intensive care in Moscow after following a warning that the girls had become “living corpses” who no-one wanted to help. Five days ago Maria Kokhno, , a campaigner for eating disorder victims, went public with a desperate plea for medical help for the pair who were at risk of “lying and dying at home” after doctors “refused” to intervene. Earlier, they had both gone into a coma for three days at another hospital but after they came round were allowed home even though they were desperately ill, said Kokhno, herself a model and reality show star who has overcome anorexia .  At the time Dasha had reduced to  kgand her sister Masha to  kg . The already-slim teenage models had been told they should reduce weight so their cheekbones were visible in order to be given more shoots, claims Kokhno. As a result of her plea the girls were rushed to a hospital in capital city Moscow,  miles north of their home in industrial city Lipetsk.  “Nobody was keen to help the girls, their mother went here and there, hospitals were rejecting them,” said Kokhno. “Masha can stand up but Dasha is only lying and cannot even lt her head,” said Kokhno. “The mother contacted TV presenter Elena Malysheva and the Nutrition Institute in Moscow but nobody wanted to deal with ‘living corpses’. Kokhno said the family reached out to her “in despair” leading to her emotional appeal to assist the girls. TV channel Moscow showed Kokhno with the girls as they entered hospital in Moscow and quoted a doctor saying the medical task “is to rescue them from a condition when their heart may stop beating at any moment”.  Kakhno said: “Dasha is slimmer than her sister, Masha has always been a bit more plump. “But still both twins were told in theto lose five kilosof weight each, so their cheekbones were visible. Both were about  kilosthen. “The girls began to diet, they did not eat after  pm and ate only steamed food. “Gradually, their portions and the number of their meals went down.  “Dasha, who has been perfect in everything, lost her weight down to  kg. “Masha tried to catch up with her lost her weight to  kg. “It was the critical weight for each girl.” She said: “The sisters were taken to hospital where they injected them with tranquilisers, so Dasha was in coma for three days. “When she woke up, their mother took both girls back home.” Kokhno said the case had left her “constantly crying” for two days when she first heard about the girls’ plight.  She has already helped other teenagers with anorexia and launched her appeal saying: “I want to find people who will help to rescue the girls who are lying and dying at home. “Their mother gave up her job and she is at home with both girls now.” Their distraught mother Natalia Ledeneva said: “They were told Dasha’s body shape is quite okay but Masha should get rid of couple of kilos… “The girls heard it in their own way. “These children have always been perfect in everything, so they decided to be perfect here too. “It all happened very quickly.  “At first, they began to reject … “They said – ‘we won’t have anything sweet tonight’ or ‘we won’t have any fruit’ or ‘we will have only salad’. “They would have one cutlet and two spoonfuls of buckwheat for dinner. “I was running after both of them, trying to persuade … “I thought they would hear what I was saying. “But it is that kind of disease when they do not hear you, the disease was progressing.”  Fighting back tears she said: “Whatever I did, however I tried to persuade them, it led to nothing…” Alexey Dobrovolsky, a well-known television doctor in Russia, said: “At first the person loses and loses weight, and finally when the brains switch on, they stop doing it.” But the body had already “transformed”. “Now whatever the human being wants to do, all the biochemical processes in his body are already ruined. “As a result, we get the kind of weight both girls have now. “The patients are in intensive care. “The task of the doctors is to rescue them from a condition when their heart may stop beating at any moment. “ Kokhno, formerly a star of the Dom- reality show, warned: “Please pay attention to your relatives. “Maybe someone close to you is quickly losing weight  “It is important to discover anorexia as early as possible.” The twins modelling school in Lipsetsk has not commented.

Ryan, who posts a new video each day, has been doing it since March , with his parents and twin sisters also featuring. When he was asked by NBC why his channel is doing so well, he replied: Because Im entertaining and Im funny.   His mum - who has declined to reveal her full name - quit her job as a chemistry teacher to concentrate on her sons growing internet career, The Verge previously reported. His mum said Ryan was an avid review watcher before his channel was launched. She told TubeFilter: “One day, he asked me, ‘How come I’m not on YouTube when all the other kids are ’ So we just decided - yeah, we can do that.

Forbes says that most of his viewers are children of a similar age, and most of his videos open with him playing with a new toy before sharing his thoughts. Because he is so young, % of Ryans earnings are being held in a trust until he is older. Last year he was the eighth highest earner, bringing in million - half the amount from this year.

It can really hurt teams,” said Jim.“We didn’t utilise Jesse and Calvin’s pace nearly enough at Hibs but they are still young and they are still learning their positions.“We have that pace, though, andyou take our three midfielders last Saturday, although Paul McGowan doubled up as a striker because of the system we wanted to play, you look at Martin Woods, you look at Glen Kamara you look at Paul McGowan, every one of them can pick a pass.“They are clever players and they can spot a pass, sowe make the runs early enough we can use that.

It can’t just come from the manager, it’s got to come from the players who are on the park,” he said.“That’s what we’ve been encouraging since we came in the door.“If somebody needs a rocket, then they get it, but encourage after that.“If they need told ‘you need to do better’, then tell them. That’s a big part of the game, but then it’s got to be equal measure of praise as well and that’s important.”It’s something Jim wants from his squad as a whole because he knows most will be called into action during a December programme that will bring seven games in just three-and-a-half weeks.A run of games that starts with Hamilton on Wednesday and ends with the pre-winter break Tayside derby against St Johnstone on December , will stretch resources but the gaffer is viewing it as a chance to pick up vital points.“It’s the same for everyone. It’s just about making sure you are recovering well between games and getting ready to go. There’s not a lot of turn around between games.“It’s an opportunity for us to maximise as many points as we can and get back into the pack.“But we’re going to need every one of the squad.“It’s a tough, tough period and there will be times when we just make changes simply because we need to freshen it, not just based on the performance.”Between now and the winter break, Jim will pay particular attention to his “over s” like Darren O’Dea, Martin Woods, Paul McGowan and Kenny Miller.At , striker Miller is comfortably the old man of the Dens Park squad.Jim, though, knows ultimately their experience will help tell them how their bodies are and whether or not they need a break from games or even training.“As a manager, I’ve always made sure that I look after the older players in the group.“I think when you are that age it’s your mentality, you know what it takes to get yourself through a game.“You know what you need to do to recover, you know how your body is.“Equally, you know when to say ‘here we go again’, it’s game time and let’s get ourselves going.”Dundee’s U s are in action this evening when they travel to take on Hearts at the Oriam .And their Youth Cup cash with Clachnacuddin takes place at Station Park on Sunday week."},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee midfielder nick ross going loco with us move in bid for mls promotion","story":"Former Dundee midfielder Nick Ross hopes his move to American second-tier side El Paso Locomotive can provide a lucrative stepping stone to Major League Soccer.After ending a short stint with Brora Rangers, Ross sealed a move to the newly-formed Texas outfit yesterday on a one-year contract with the option of a further year.The -year-old will report for pre-season with El Paso in January as the club prepares for its  debut in the USL Championship.Although no promotion to the ring-fenced MLS is available, former Scotland U  international Ross hopes making an impression at his new club may catch the eye of clubs higher up the American ladder.Ross said: “I’m just looking forward to getting over and seeing how the year goes.“If I play well over there the target is to get into the MLS but that’s everybody’s target so it’s not that easy.There are a lot of good teams at this level.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13664076.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS169410821.jpg","title":"cctv cameras blink another ayrshire","story":"NewsCCTV cameras on blink at ANOTHER Ayrshire hospital following stabbing at Ayrs AilsaThe Ayrshire Post can reveal that the Ailsa is not the only Ayrshire hospital where cameras are not recording.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsDetectives scour the scene at the Ailsa Hospital \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSecurity cameras at MORE than one Ayrshire hospital have gone dark, it can be revealed. It follows a kne attacker plunging terror through the health network at the Ailsa Hospital. The wooly-hatted suspect remains at large after escaping past CCTV cameras switched off for  years. Community worker Donna Maxwell, , was stabbed en route to her car on Thursday morning. Now the Post can reveal cameras are also out of order at Girvan Community Hospital – a building shared by the town’s police. Police are still hunting the Ailsa suspect, understood to be a patient at the unit. But they have been forced to launch a desperate appeal for dashcam footage caught on nearby motors. The frantic search has failed to produce a result – despite the alleged culprit being known to Ailsa staff.  One NHS source told the Post: “The woman who did this is no stranger to staff at the hospital. “She had requested to speak to a particular person on Thursday and was told they weren’t there. “That seemed to agitate her and when she got outside she carried out this random attack in the car park. “Luckily she didn’t get any of Donna’s vital organs or this could have been a whole lot worse.” Mum-of-one, Donna, of Irvine, is believed to have stumbled back into the Ailsa after the attack. She was transferred to nearby Ayr Hospital for treatment. Both the Ailsa and Ayr Hospital were put on lockdown as police dog teams raced to the scene and a force chopper circled the skies. And despite an arrest on an “unrelated matter” being made later that night, police admitted on Tuesday the suspect had not been caught. A force spokeswoman said: “There has been no arrest and inquiries are ongoing.” Donna, who was released from hospital on Friday, is now recovering at home.  Husband Tom, , said: “She is very tired and sore. Everything is a bit raw at the moment. “We have been asked by the police not to say anything about what happened or make any comment.” Now a furious union claims staff and patients have been “misled” by NHS bosses over cameras being turned off. UNISON President Gordon McKay, who worked at Ailsa Hospital for many years, said: “Our first thoughts are for the member of staff and her family. “It is shocking that someone who is dedicated to providing high-quality healthcare to the people of Scotland should be attacked at work. “In the longer term, serious questions need to be asked and answered by senior management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran over why it would appear they were leading patients, relatives and staff in the hospital to believe that CCTV was operating as a safety measure when they knew it wasn’t. “Anyone who takes a decision which misleads people about safety matters must be held to account.” When pressed by this paper, NHS chiefs insisted cameras at all of Ayrshire’s major sites were in working order.

Scores of jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. Senior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.  Staff have been given the stark warning by outgoing Principal, Heather Dunk. It comes as the college leaks cash on a costly PFI deal for its campus at Kilwinning. A source said: “Mrs Dunk announced to staff that the college will run out of money in a few short years. “She blamed this entirely on the funding council, the Scottish Government and the PFI at Kilwinning. “In a blatant attempt to essentially threaten staff against pursuing the cost-of-living pay rise, she made clear that at least  full time jobs would need to go to pay to keep the college afloat.” The warning comes as Mrs Dunk prepares to step down in the Spring. And a row has engulfed management as they prepare to appoint her successor. We told last week how the recruitment agency leading the search includes the we of college chair, Willie Mackie. A College spokesman said: “The Principal recently met with all staff to provide an update regarding the financial challenges facing the college due to increased staff costs arising from national bargaining and the excessive costs of the PfI campus in Kilwinning. “The College is working with the Scottish Funding Council to find a solution to the dficult financial position, however,additional funding is not available, the outcome may be the loss of jobs to reduce expenditure. “The Principal continues to update the trade unions, the student association and staff on a regular basis to ensure openness and transparency. “All staff are aware of the challenges the Colleges faces and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, wants to see the college backed by the Scottish Government until the end of its PFI contract. But he said: “Unfortunately, the response I have so far received from the Scottish Government to this request has been negative. “But I will continue to argue the case for additional funding to be allocated to the College in order that their ongoing commitments can be met and the loss of staff avoided.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"famous tower blocks almost certain","story":"NewsFamous tower blocks almost certain to be flattenedThe trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe only towers in South Ayrshire are doomed \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s famous tower blocks are almost certainly to be flattened after a repair bill landed for up to pound MILLION of work. The astonishing figure - which works out at pound, for each flat - is being seen as hopeless to fund. The trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .   Their destruction will mean the loss of  one-bedroom flats and tenants will have to be farmed out to new homes. An insider at owners South Ayrshire Council said: “The price is too high and unless there is a money miracle, they will come down. “Officials have been taken aback at how much money they need. To save them would be financially ridiculous.” Ironically the council has already sanctioned pound million worth of initial work which has already begun. Housing staff say that to build a brand new flat either on the same riverside site or where in the area is just pound,. Each of the blocks has  homes and  have been deliberately left empty as the scale of repair emerged. One-to-one consultation is to take place with the tenants - most of whom are elderly - over the next six months. Councillors heard about the state of the “essential and advisable” works at a meeting yesterday . These include the removal of the external cladding, existing timber and aluminium windows, and pitched roof covering new insulated render system full rewiring new heating and hot water systems upgrading the sprinkler system and upgrading passenger lts. One long-time tenant told the Post: “If it is going to cost about pound, to build a new flat for me to rent, I have a money saving plan. “Give me pound, and I’ll buy my own we place in Ayr. Job done.” If repairs were sanctioned tenants would need to be decanted for a year. Housing boss Donald Gillies said: “As we consider what happens next with the high flats in Ayr, our tenants will continue to be our focus at all times. That’s why we’re asking councillors to approve a formal consultation where we can sit down on an inidual basis with each and every one of our tenants in Riverside Place and discuss their specic needs and preferences. “If Councillors agree, we’re also seeking approval to appoint two dedicated officers to lead on the consultation and engagement exercise, which would get underway in the new year with a further report to Councillors in June. “It would only be then that any decision on the future of the flats would be taken and tenants would be involved in discussions every step of the way.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13663409.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_231118pets_04JPG.jpg","title":"hopping mad mauchline miss doolittle","story":"NewsHopping mad Mauchline Miss Doolittle issues Christmas pleaPoppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsPoppy with guinea pals Ginny and Delilah and cabbage-eating rabbit Jasper. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hopping mad seven-year-old is warning others that rabbits are pets for le and not just Christmas.

European Council.Instead, he said Article  allows the ldquounilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded.Prime Minister Theresa Mayrsquos official spokesman told reporters in Westminster that ldquothis is not a final judgment, adding: ldquoIt does nothing in any event to change the clear position of the Government that Article  is not going to be revoked.The case to decide whether an EU member state such as the UK can decide on its own to revoke the Article  withdrawal process, or whether the agreement of the  other member states would be required, was brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians.A statement from the ECJ said: ldquoIn answer to the question from the Scottish court, the Advocate General proposes that the Court of Justice should, in its future judgment, declare that Article  TEU allows the unilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded, provided that the revocation has been decided upon in accordance with the member statersquos constitutional requirements, is formally notied to the European Council and does not involve an abusive practice.The opinion, which is not binding on the court, comes just a week after the case was heard at the ECJ following a referral from Scotlandrsquos highest civil court, the Court of Session.A judgment by the court will take place at a later date.Those who brought the case argue unilateral revocation is possible and believe it could pave the way for an alternative option to Brexit, such as a Peoplersquos Vote to enable remaining in the EU.Legal representatives for the UK Government believe the case is inadmissible as it deals with a hypothetical situation, since the Governmentrsquos policy is not to revoke Article .Lawyers representing the Council of the European Union and from the European Commission argue revocation is possible but would require unanimous agreement from all member states.#Brexitndash Case C-  Wightman ndash AG Campos Saacutenchez-Bordona: Article  TFEU notication of

of Scottish politicians ndash Labour MEPs Catherine Stihler and David Martin, Joanna Cherry MP and Alyn Smith MEP of the SNP, and Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, together with lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project.Their request for the Court of Session to refer the question of whether Article  can be unilaterally revoked to the ECJ was initially refused, before that ruling was overturned on appeal.Two attempts by the UK Government, which is contesting the case, to appeal against the referral to the European court were rejected.At the hearing last week, Aidan OrsquoNeill QC, representing the politicians who brought the case, said they need to know all their options on Brexit, including whether the UK can unilaterally halt the process ahead of critical votes on the withdrawal agreement.Advocate General for Scotland Lord Keen QC, representing the UK Government, said the case is a ldquohypothetical validity challenge and those behind it seek ldquopolitical ammunition to be used in, and to pressure, the UK Parliament.Hubert Legal, representing the Council of the European Union, said allowing unilateral withdrawal could lead to ldquodisaster, of which ldquothe main victim could be the European project altogether.He said Article  is ldquonot ambiguous, adding: ldquoThe prerogative of acting alone will have been exhausted by putting the notication letter on the councilrsquos table.Tory former attorney general and second referendum campaigner Dominic Grieve welcomed the ruling, telling BBC Radio rsquos Today: ldquoItrsquos clearly signicant.ldquoOf course it doesnrsquot necessarily have to be translated into a judgment, but the opinion of the advocate general is often very influential in forming the opinion of the court

contention that Article  only allows the possibility of revocation following a unanimous decision of the European Council.Instead, he said Article  allows the ldquounilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded.Prime Minister Theresa Mayrsquos official spokesman told reporters in Westminster that ldquothis is not a final judgment, adding: ldquoIt does nothing in any event to change the clear position of the Government that Article  is not going to be revoked.The case to decide whether an EU member state such as the UK can decide on its own to revoke the Article  withdrawal process, or whether the agreement of the  other member states would be required, was brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians.A statement from the ECJ said: ldquoIn answer to the question from the Scottish court, the Advocate General proposes that the Court of Justice should, in its future judgment, declare that Article  TEU allows the unilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded, provided that the revocation has been decided upon in accordance with the member statersquos constitutional requirements, is formally notied to the European Council and does not involve an abusive practice.The opinion, which is not binding on the court, comes just a week after the case was heard at the ECJ following a referral from Scotlandrsquos highest civil court, the Court of Session.A judgment by the court will take place at a later date.Those who brought the case argue unilateral revocation is possible and believe it could pave the way for an alternative option to Brexit, such as a Peoplersquos Vote to enable remaining in the EU.Legal representatives for the UK Government believe the case is inadmissible as it deals with a hypothetical situation, since the Governmentrsquos policy is not to revoke Article .Lawyers representing the Council of the European Union and from the European Commission argue revocation is possible but would require unanimous agreement from all member states.#Brexit ndash Case C-  Wightman ndash AG Campos Saacutenchez-Bordona: Article  TFEU notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU can be revoked unilaterally under certain

Joanna Cherry MP and Alyn Smith MEP of the SNP, and Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, together with lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project.Their request for the Court of Session to refer the question of whether Article  can be unilaterally revoked to the ECJ was initially refused, before that ruling was overturned on appeal.Two attempts by the UK Government, which is contesting the case, to appeal against the referral to the European court were rejected.At the hearing last week, Aidan OrsquoNeill QC, representing the politicians who brought the case, said they need to know all their options on Brexit, including whether the UK can unilaterally halt the process ahead of critical votes on the withdrawal agreement.Advocate General for Scotland Lord Keen QC, representing the UK Government, said the case is a ldquohypothetical validity challenge and those behind it seek ldquopolitical ammunition to be used in, and to pressure, the UK Parliament.Hubert Legal, representing the Council of the European Union, said allowing unilateral withdrawal could lead to ldquodisaster, of which ldquothe main victim could be the European project altogether.He said Article  is ldquonot ambiguous, adding: ldquoThe prerogative of acting alone will have been exhausted by putting the notication letter on the councilrsquos table.Tory former attorney general and second referendum campaigner Dominic Grieve welcomed the ruling, telling BBC Radio rsquos Today: ldquoItrsquos clearly signicant.ldquoOf course it doesnrsquot necessarily have to be translated into a judgment, but the opinion of the advocate general is often very influential in forming the opinion of the court and it reinforces something I have to say I personally always thought was probably the case.Askedit made it more likely there would be a new public vote, he said: ldquoIt is certainly helpful because it removes one of the arguments, which is: lsquoOh well, they would never allow us to

Apart from the obvious fact that the mention of the word Brexit sends most of us into a state of comatose anger delirium , this would be event TV at its most pointless.Unlike in the sort of debates wersquove become used to over the last few years, held before referendums and general elections - and indeed most of the shows it would replace in the schedules - no one other than the MPs watching would have a vote.Adding to the futility surrounding this set-up are the Brexit stances of the only two politicians invited to take part: barring a major change of heart, the positions being argued by Mrs May and Mr Corbyn would not only be similar, but similarly bad.The irony of all this is staggering. Here you have Mrs May, who voted Remain, trying to ram a terrible Brexit deal through Parliament that will, by her Governmentrsquos own admission, make the country poorer. This bleak halfway house leaves the UK worse off in every way, with no control or say over EU policy, having to align itself regardless, while losing all the benefits of the Single Market.Mr Corbyn, meanwhile, a lelong Eurosceptic who claims he voted Remain, has taken his party to a bizarre, opaque and convoluted position that also has us leaving the EU, despite knowing full well this will cause genuine and serious harm to the very people and public services he has spent his political le trying to protect from Tory policy. He agrees with Mrs May on ending free movement and leaving the Single Market, his only real ergence from her being the continual peddling of the fantasy that the EU would give him a far better deal than it gave her. Just because hersquos Jezza, you understand.In some ways, you can see why Mrs May, never a natural performer on this type of , would nevertheless want to take part in a debate. Donrsquot think for a minute itrsquos about persuading the public to support her deal ndash we have no say. No, as is usually the case with the Tories, this is all about selling it to a faction, in this case the grassroots party membership, who she wants to pressure their MPs to vote with, rather than against, her.As for Mr Corbyn, who in another striking similarity with the PM is also a poor public communicator, Irsquom still trying to work out what he thinks he can get out of this exposure.And thatrsquos whyI was Nicola Sturgeon, Irsquod stay well out of it and let these two lame ducks go it alone. For now, at least.The First Minister, who is not only an excellent debater but has a clear and cogent position on Brexit, says she wants in on the action, to put the case for staying in the Single Market and or having a so-called Peoplersquos Vote.Like many, I share her concerns around Scotland being deliberately left out of the process, as her lack of an invite to the debate only highlights. But I honestly donrsquot think she should waste her time with this one.If and when the Peoplersquos Vote, or even another general election is called, both of which are possible scenarios, her voice will be needed to persuade not only Scots, but arguably more importantly voters around the UK, that Brexit can and must be stopped or at least signicantly watered down. In that scenario she should not only debate Mrs May and Mr Corbyn but be ready to make her case against hard Brexiteers like Boris Johnson.Until a meaningful opportunity arises, however, Ms Sturgeon should keep her powder clean and let Mrs May and Mr Corbyn keep fighting the phony war."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9105685.jpg?type=article-full","title":"david-mundell-to-tell-banks-that-brexit-deal-offers-clarity","story":"The Scottish Secretary will try to sell Theresa Mayrsquos deal at a briefing for Scotlandrsquos poundbn financial services sector in Edinburgh.:David Mundell faces cross-party calls to resignAmong the employers taking part will be RBS, Tesco Bank, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, KPMG, Pheonix Group, and CYBG, which owns Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and Virgin Money UK.Also attending is Scottish Financial Enterprise, the body representing Scotlandrsquos financial services industry, whose members employ more than , people.The SNP said Mr Mundell must be ldquocompletely deludedhe believed his own spin, and said Mrs Mayrsquos deal and political agreement offered only uncertainty on trade relations.SNP MP Tommy Sheppard said: ldquoIf David Mundell is so confident in the Tory governmentrsquos dodgy deal, hersquoll put his neck on the line and resignit fails to pass through the Commons.

We know No Deal is an option. But as the Prime Minister said herself, No Brexit is also an option, and MPs deserve legal clarity on that.ldquoThey deserve to knowArticle  can be revoked by the unanimous agreement of all  other European states.

Within the next two years that will rise to  for everybody, with both the Labour and Coalition governments agreeing down the years that such changes are necessary to help deal with the burden of an ageing population.The arguments in favour of the move are sound. When the first state pension was introduced over a century ago, the cost of providing it was relatively small, with just one in four people living long enough to receive it and those that did generally only surviving a further nine years once theyrsquod started to draw it. Fast forward to  and le expectancy is so high that women in particular can easily expect to live at least  years in retirement, with the cost of providing the state pension expected to balloon from pound billion a year at the moment to poundbn in the s. As the bill for state pensions is met out of current year taxation, the intergenerational impact of that will be immense. Anything that can reduce that burden while also removing a rare historical inequality that favoured women over men is to be welcomed.Yet while the change will affect all working women in the long run, it is only those born in the s that are really feeling its impact. Indeed, while phasing was deemed the fairest way to effect the increase to , it has meant that while a woman born in April  could retire at ,she had been born three years later she would have had to wait until she was . Not only that, but with legislation passed in  speeding up the rate at which equalisation was achieved while also raising the overall state pension age to , a woman born in December  has seen her own retirement date sht first from December  to September  and then on to December .No wonder the affected women are irate, with campaign groups such as Women Against State Pension Inequalityand Backto accusing the Government of robbing them of their retirement dues. Yet while Backto last week won the right to challenge how the Government handled the increases in the courts, it seems unlikely that they will achieve their ultimate goal of having the pension-age increases reversed.Nor should they, particularly when the arguments being put forward by the women are taken into account. While at first the s women claimed their pension age should not be raised because they had not been given adequate time to prepare for the change, more recently they have argued that everything from career breaks to pay inequality make them entitled to earlier and longer payments than men.Their points about historical inequalities are are certainly valid. Thanks to huge societal shts in the past few decades we are getting to a position where women - and men - can just about have it all. Indeed, with men taking on an ever-greater share of household responsibilities, women have been freed up to pursue their career ambitions and that in turn has enabled men to enjoy a better work-le balance. That is to everyonersquos benefit.Yet, as gender pay gap statistics show, the near-equality that so many of us enjoy in the home is not being reflected in the workplace, with men continuing to dominate the most lucrative senior positions while women in general continue to fill lower-paid ones. Not only does that put women at a financial disadvantage when it comes to saving for their own retirements, it also means their careers suffer when there is a child or elderly relative to be cared for: regardless of how committed we are to achieving gender equality, household economics will almost always dictate that the lower salary is the one worth being partly sacriced. That in turn reduces the amount that women can channel into a private or workplace pension, exacerbating the long-term gender pay gap and reinforcing gender stereotypes in the process.But these are problems that affect women entering the workforce just as much as those preparing to leave it and, unless something drastic is done - and fast - they will inevitably go on to impact the working lives of the girls yet to begin their working lives too. Crucially, these are not problems that the state pension - a benefit designed to provide everyone with the same foundation income in retirement, regardless of their other means - can, or should, be used to solve.Yes, the Government has a role to play in helping eradicate inequality, and it must be held to account for that. But reversing for some of us a policy that is supposed to make things fairer for all of us is not the way to do it."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9129662.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nicola-sturgeon-urges-theresa-may-to-avoid-utterly-disastrous-deal-in-brexit-talks","story":"Scotlands First Minister called for the UKs departure from the European Union to be delayed in order to find a \"workable alternative\" to Mrs Mays Brexit deal, which faces widespread opposition in the Commons.:Nicola Sturgeon rejects idea of Scottish independence without IndyrefBut in talks at Westminster, Mrs May urged the First Minister to listen to Scottish business chiefs and back the deal or risk going back to \"square one\".Ms Sturgeon said: \"I used todays meeting with the Prime Minister to reiterate that it cannot - and must not - be a  choice between her proposed deal and a no-deal outcome, which threatens to be utterly disastrous for jobs, business and living standards.\"Instead, there must be a recognition that,the PMs deal is defeated in the Commons as is widely expected, then a workable alternative is urgently needed.\"That means there should be an extension to the Article  process, and we will join with those from other parties in trying to secure such an extension.\"Extending the Article  process would keep the UK in the EU beyond the current March   departure date.:Against the odds: Theresa May begins parliamentary fight of her le to win Brexit Plan voteMs Sturgeon added: \"The SNP will lay our amendment to the meaningful vote later this week and we will continue to work with others to build consensus around alternative proposals that would deliver on the vote of the people of Scotland to remain.\"With the UK Governments own published figures now making clear that any kind of Brexit would make us all poorer, the time has come for all those who oppose the extreme Brexit championed by the right-wing of the Tory Party to come together and make a stand.\"A Downing Street spokesman said: \"The Prime Minister spoke about the support she has received from fishermen, farmers and business leaders - like Sir Ian Wood - who back the deal as it gives them the clarity and certainty they need to protect jobs and living standards.\"The Prime Minister urged the First Minister to listen to these voices in their support of the deal as opposed to risking a no-deal Brexit or going back to square one of negotiations.\"The First Ministers visit comes after all parties at Holyrood, except the Conservatives, united to back a motion opposing Mrs Mays Brexit deal.MSPs will vote on the motion at the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-cherry-why-we-must-know-if-mps-have-the-power-to-revoke-article-50","story":"We expect the case to establish as a matter of legal certainty that Brexit may be stopped by the UK revoking the Article  notice.The fact that the UK Government has fought this case tooth and nail at considerable expense shows how desperate the PM is to prevent MPs having this certainty.:ECJ Advocate General says UK can revoke Article  unilaterallyThe question matters because when MPs vote on whether to raty the Withdrawal Agreement, a vote against ratication could result in a no-deal exit unless there is an alternative.When he referred the case to Luxembourg, Scotlandrsquos top judge said: ldquoThe answer will have the effect of clarying the options open to MPshellip..Whatever the interest of MSPs and MEPs, MPs have an interest in seeing the matter resolved.\"On that basis the petition is competent at least at the instance of an MP.The case was heard by the Grand Chamber of the Court comprising  judges.Extraordinarily counsel for the UK Government refused to take a position on whether revocation is possible and argued only that the case was inadmissible.:Scotlands Brexit legal bid explained as European court to hear Article  challengeNormally where a partyrsquos primary position is that the court should not entertain the question, a fall-back position would be advanced.Instead the UK government invited the court not to open up a Pandorarsquos box.

This includes up to eight hours of debate on December , ,  and  - with the votes expected on December . Amendments have been tabled by two Labour MPs to extend the time for debate.- What are they debating The Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by the Government, which outlines the terms on which the UK will leave the EU and the desired future relationship. MPs are being asked to approve this by supporting a motion tabled by the Prime Minister.- Can MPs change what has been put forward Yes. Speaker John Bercow can select up to six amendments which MPs can then vote on.- What are the amendments Various amendments have been tabled. Labours official proposal would decline to approve Mrs Mays Brexit deal and explains this is because it fails to provide for a permanent UK-EU customs union and \"strong\" single market deal. It also voices concerns over Northern Ireland.Labours amendment also outlines that MPs will \"pursue every option\" that prevents the UK leaving the EU on the terms of Mrs Mays deal or leaving without a deal.Tory and Labour backbenchers have also tabled an amendment which seeks to reject Mrs Mays deal while also avoiding a no-deal Brexit.- What will happen with the votes Its hard to say. Some  Conservative MPs have said publicly they will vote against Mrs Mays deal,  have said they will not vote in favour and more than  have said they are unhappy with it.With Mrs Mays minority government allies the DUP also expressing their own concerns, the chance of the deal being approved with a simple majority of  of the  MPs eligible to vote is highly unlikely.Any amendment would need to appeal to a wide enough group of MPs to receive the required votes to be successful. Abstentions are likely on all votes.- How does the debate work Ministers are expected to open and close each day, with the Opposition frontbench also having their say. MPs will be chosen by the Speaker to make speeches although their seniority - including positions previously held in government - usually influences the running order. A time limit is likely on backbench speeches, with MPs fearing it could be as low as four minutes.It is the decision of the MP speaking on whether they accept interventions from others during their speech.- What does a vote involve MPs walk through ision lobbies - in essence, rooms either side of the Commons chamber known as the ayes and noes. They have eight minutes to reach the ision lobbies when a vote is called.They register their vote on a tablet device and the result is usually announced within  minutes of the vote being called.If there is more than one vote, MPs tend to wait in the chamber and the process is repeated.- What about the House of Lords They will spend three days debating the deal on December ,  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"charity night at jewellers","story":"An Inverurie family-owned business hosted a charity Christmas shopping night recently.Sinclairs the jewellers held the event in support of local children’s charity Charlie House.The business welcomed over  people to the store for an evening of Christmas shopping, fizz, canapes, music, prizes and special offers.All ticket proceeds from the event were donated to Aberdeen-based children’s charity Charlie House, which supports babies, children and young people with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions.The event raised over £.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Tuesday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : amA call for “sustained action” against the “substantial discrepancy” in fuel prices between the Northern Isles and the Scottish mainland has been made.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond. Sadly the whole of our public sector is suffering from the impact of funding cuts and we must now end austerity and fund the le line services that our people need.Share your views by emailing us at newsdesk@spp-groupTuesday  Dec  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Its going to have a big impact. People now realise itrsquos not just the employees that are going to be affected, itrsquos all their friends and families as well as many local businesses.\"And its not just Dingwall where this will be felt. I have been told that people are coming from all over and from as far away as Ullapool to work there.\"This was echoed by fellow ward councillor Angela MacLean. She said: \"This is extremely sad news for all the staff who have been loyal employees of the Edinburgh Salmon Company for many years. The business has had a long association with Dingwall and this closure will have a knock-on effect on many of the local businesses in the area.\"There is never a good time to be made redundant but in the run up to Christmas this is a double blow for many local families.MSP John Finne said: \"This is bitterly disappointing news from the Edinburgh Salmon Company, and will come as a blow to all those workers on site. I have sought assurances that the Scottish Government will continue to make every possible effort to assist the workforce of Edinburgh Salmon Company in light of this closure.\"There are fears that some families of Eastern European origin who have contributed to the local economy for upwards of a decade are now considering cutting their losses and leaving the area.\"I know because of this loads of people will go back to Poland,\" said a Polish national who has friends working there. \"Its going to be a dficult time for those people. Some of them have worked there for  years.\"Another member of the Polish community, who also did not want to be named, said: \"My partner used to work there. I feel sorry for my friends and their families. I know how people are feeling, but nobody will speak about it. There are loads of people working there and people are scared.\"In a statement, Europeacuteenne de la Mer, which has cited challenging market conditions and is understood to have registered losses in excess of poundmillion, said it regretted \"no feasible alternative solution to closure was found during collective consultation\" and the factory will close at the end of the year. It will meet its obligations until the turn of the year when the factory will close.It said: \"We would like to thank all employees for their commitment to the company to date and their professionalism during this dficult time.\"Next Fridays jobs fair in Dingwall will run from pm to pm at the Town hall.

In December , the ground shted for Scotland’s private renters with the introduction of the Private Residential Tenancy for all new tenancies alongside a new free-to-access tribunal, set up to resolve disputes between landlords and renters.   The new system was introduced to rebalance the relationship between private renters and their landlords. Shelter Scotland was one of the leading voices in the decade-long campaign for this new type of tenancy. Last year,  per cent of calls to our free housing advice helpline came from private renters – a disproportionate number as privately rented homes represent only  per cent of households in Scotland – many of whom complained of repairs issues and who often felt the balance of power lay squarely with their landlords, given the limited security that the old Short-Assured Tenancy offered.The statistics on private renting show high growth in the sector, which has tripled in size since . Many more people are wanting to rent from private landlords for longer and looking for the additional security that a long-term home provides.This is why Shelter Scotland campaigned for the new tenancy which, we hope, will eventually provide private renters with the stability they want while retaining the flexibility they need. A key change introduced by the new system is the removal of the “no fault” grounds for eviction. Landlords must now provide a tenant with a valid reason should they want the property back – and tenants can now challenge this at the new tribunal,required. : David Alexander: Rental costs pale compared with other essentialsSo far, there is evidence that shows the new tenancy is having a positive impact. Over the past year, we have been running workshops and talking to tenants and landlords and letting agents.One tenant told me that the new rules were giving people back a sense of security. The tenant, who said she is soon to become a landlord herself, said that “at one point it was accepted that you could be born and die in the same home. But for years the lack of secure housing has meant people have been constantly on the move, uprooted from schools, family, support networks”. The removal of fixed-term tenancies for new renters means that people should feel more stable and be able to plan ahead. One tenant who had been renting in central Edinburgh for the last three years talked about her experience of being forced to commit to a rent increase every six months or face looking for a new place to stay, which was stressful. She now has one of the new tenancies which means that rent increases are limited to one every  months – and with three months’ notice. Although she does feel more secure as a result, she still has concerns over how landlords may “try to get around the rules” – such as trying to evict so they can make seasonal ‘killings’ during the Festival season. This is the sort of bad practice the new tenancy hopes to eradicate.: Scottish Labour calls for ‘state intervention’ in private rented sectorAnother tenant had put up with a bad neighbour rather than move, as she knew her existing landlord wouldn’t end her tenancy unexpectedly, but had heard of many other renters being told to move out after their initial six months’ contract ended and so chose to accept the unwanted noise rather than encounter the unknown. The same renter also highlighted, even with the removal of “no fault” evictions, there are still  grounds for eviction that a landlord may use to end a tenancy so there is still an element of uncertainty in private renting.At Shelter Scotland, we believe that over the long-term, the security and stability afforded by the new tenancy will drive up standards in the private rented sector. Some renters talked about their disrepair over experiences before the new rules came in. One renter went without heating or hot water for several weeks because the letting agency didn’t treat a broken boiler as an urgent repair. Under the new tenancy agreement, this tenant could demand the letting agent or landlord act without fear that they might be evicted should they complain.A year on and there is no doubt the legislation has begun to sht the power balance between tenant and landlords towards a more equal footing. There is still a long way to go, not least because far too many private tenants aren’t aware of their new rights and how to enforce them.In my experience of the last year, private tenants are more likely to take issues to the tribunal or contact their landlord or letting agent directly with issues because they feel empowered and more secure under the new system.The tenant who had the faulty boiler  She said it wasn’t just the fear of eviction that stopped her demanding an urgent repair, it was that the agent didn’t respond to her calls. As another client, whose washing machine flooded the kitchen the day after she moved in, put it: “It feels too challenging asking the agency to do things. It took several phone calls to them and then Shelter Scotland to seek advice. It proved incredibly stressful and affected my mental health.” We need more people to tackle bad landlords and letting agents to ensure that private renting genuinely is fit for the st century. The legislation is in place and private residential tenants have greater rights. It is now vital that they are empowered to use them when necessary – the real transformation in private renting will be when they don’t have to.James Mullaney is project officer on Shelter Scotland’s Private Renters’ Voice Project©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4837290.1543669277!/image/image.jpg","title":"outlander s craig mcginlay on rugby acting and teamwork","story":"From blending with Beckham to hanging with Sam Heughan, the Scottish actor is on the moveCraig McGinlay is going places. He’s already made the move from playing rugby to acting with a role in the latest season of Outlander, and now he’s moving ahead of the pack with a new Bollywood film, Shamshera. Right now he’s on the phone minutes after his flight from Mumbai lands, catching a connection to Scotland where he is due for a bout of fight training for his latest role.“SorryI sound a bit tired and jetlagged.” He doesn’t, in fact. He sounds on a high after a week of meetings and rehearsals for the action adventure film, walking and talking  to the dozen in his warm Paisley tones as he cuts a swathe through the airport, all sculpted beard, Matchless leather jacket and jeans. In four short years, he’s made the move from working as a sports consultant to acting in films, this latest being made by Bollywood giants Yash Raj Films. Directed by Karan Malhotra, Shamshera stars Ranbir Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt and Vaani Kapoor as well as McGinlay playing the lead villain.“It’s been a bit of a whirlwind in Mumbai,” he says. “I’ve never been there before and I’m just getting used to it. I’m back for a week here, then back to India and we’re filming until July.”We’ll catch him while we can, when he’s back for a bit of dreich weather to cool him down after the heat of India.“I like dreich-ness,” he says, “the fresh air.” He’s upbeat and positive and why wouldn’t he be  He’s running with the ball, taking his chances without getting ahead of himself. With his muscular physique he’s action hero villain material and has played both so far, honing his sword skills and horsemanship as well as his acting. Guy Ritchie cast him as good guy Sir Percival in last year’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, which starred Jude Law and Charlie Hunnam. Then he nailed lead villain Aldred in Knightfall, a historical drama about the Knights Templar on the History Channel alongside Tom Cullen. He packs a punch too in the season two opener of the Edinburgh-filmed BBC  student thriller Clique, before playing a baddie again in Outlander. “I play a horrible guy called MacNeil and the army of Outlander fans on Twitter have been at me over it,” he laughs. “No, there’s been a lot of positive feedback. I never really thought I was gonna play villains because I always loved watching Superman and James Bond and I thought action hero roles were for me. And I do still want to do those, but the latest three have been villains, so it’s nice to do that too.“This is my first Bollywood film and I didn’t know much about it,” he says. “But I do now. Bollywood just gets bigger and bigger and bigger. It was daunting, but it’s been amazing. I’ve worked on big sets – King Arthur and Outlander were massive – but I’ve been blown away by this. There are  people on the sets in India just now, building forts, castles, docks, caves, it’s incredible.” McGinlay didn’t expect to break into the Bollywood market, but after Guy Ritchie finished King Arthur, he moved on to making Aladdin, using a lot of Bollywood actors and the same casting director who was working on Shamshera.“There was that initial connection: it’s a small world,” says McGinlay, who knows to take his chances when he can, and put in the hard work when he is given an opportunity. “I’m playing a British soldier and I’ve been doing screen tests, rehearsals, stunt work with horses and fitness and soldier training. “And I’m doing some fight training now with Seoras Wallace who did the fight choreography on Braveheart, Gladiator and Highlander. I’m also working with my friend Roger Gracie Gomes, who is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighter. So it’s a real adrenalin rush movie, it’s going to be fun.”But McGinlay is not all action and no words – in fact he’s learning Hindi for the part, something a bit dferent to go alongside his swashbuckling skill set.“I speak a little bit of Hindi in this so I’ve been doing intensive language training. I would never have thought I would be learning another language for a movie any time soon, but I’m really excited about the challenge and enjoying it so far.” Not that he’s been out and about in the sprawl of Mumbai to practise his vocabulary. With a schedule that consists of am pick-ups and full studio days of rehearsals, Hindi training, screen tests, costume fittings and horse riding, he’s hardly been out of the studio.“I’ve only been out to go to meetings and do muay thai training at Soho House, although that has phenomenal views of the beach! Once we start shooting I’ll be there for a long time, so maybe I’ll get to walk along it.” Among the on-set discussions has been the question of McGinlay’s appearance, from hair colour to moustache, beard or no beard. “They’re trying dferent looks, dferent hair colouring, moustache, no moustache. We’ll see. If a director wants something, I give it a go, whether it’s having a moustache or dferent hair colour or having to go skinny or bulk up, learn a language… The exciting thing for me is the challenge of trying to become the character.”The grooming issue is something McGinlay has been brushing up on since he started acting and did a bit of modelling too. He picked up Breakthrough Star of the Year at the  Scottish Style Awards and was named as British GQ Rising Star last year, requiring him to get red carpet ready.“It’s all a bit of a change for me from shorts, T-shirts and trainers, which is what I wore before. It’s a bit of a learning curve,” he laughs.Shamshera won’t be released until , but McGinlay is on our screens at the moment in Outlander, season four of the Starz and Amazon Prime International hit which features Sam Heughan and Caitriona Balfe. Based on Diana Gabaldon’s historical time travel novels following the adventures of Jacobite Highlander Jamie Fraser and Second World War nurse Claire Randall, the new series sees them building a le in th century America. It’s a time of slavery and colonisers encountering Native Americans, with Scotland doubling as North Carolina. McGinlay plays Andrew MacNeil, a Scot who leads a racist mob. “He’s not a nice guy – a horrible character and a horrible situation. I thought Outlander dealt with the slavery issue very well, and these issues should be raised. It was a tough episode to film and it hit home how bad that situation was. There were a couple of people crying on set, and you do feel emotion. The hairs were standing up on the back of my neck.“Because there’s a massive Outlander fan base you want to do these characters justice, but I was such a small part of this beast of a machine that is Outlander. It was amazing to be part of it.”McGinlay was pleased to be involved not least because he sees the “Outlander effect” as building momentum for the establishment of a Scottish film studio. “Outlander is sparking ripples throughout Scotland. You see it at the Baftas, in the press, all the talk of building a film studio. It would be a massive positive because there are so many talented, passionate people in the industry here who are just dying to get in there – we could do some good stuff.”Now  and based in London, McGinlay is modest about his success so far, although ambitious to make the most of the opportunities that come his way.“I’m still new to acting and I’m learning all the time,” he says. “I wasn’t sure how some actors might take it, because I’m not trained in acting and I’ve obviously moved quite quickly within the last two and a half years. It’s early stages…” One of the actors whose path he has crossed is fellow Paisley Buddy Gerry Butler, who he first met at a film festival last year in Ischia, Italy. “I’ve only met him two or three times, so don’t know him well, but he’s been really kind, given me some good advice and introduced me to a couple of people. And obviously the guy’s from Paisley, and doing really, really well, has an amazing career.”At one time McGinlay was destined for a rugby career, playing for the national under-s team in the World Cup, but was forced out by injury in . “I dislocated my shoulder playing in a World Cup in Italy and had two operations. I could probably have come back and played as it doesn’t cause me any hassle now. I liked the game, but I probably didn’t love it enough.” Determined to stay in sport, McGinlay did a sports science and physiology degree at the University of Stirling and after graduating started working with professional athletes. Setting up his own consultancy, he worked with professional footballers and rugby players, focusing on general fitness and doing sports massage. He trained athletes for the  Delhi,  London and  Commonwealth Games, working with the hockey, badminton, swimming, cycling, weightlting teams. “Then they took the ones I was working with to make an advert for the Games and said the weightlter was a little bit too short, would I step in  Why not  I had to pull on this tiny one-piece weightlting outfit and was out in the cold by the Squinty Bridge [in Glasgow] with everyone looking, thinking, ‘What is this idiot doing, lting a bar above his head’, doing a clean jerk.” He laughs. “Anyway, the ad came out and randomly a director saw it and I got a lead role in a short film that randomly won best thriller in LA and Calgary so I went out for the premiere. It wasn’t Hollywood or anything, but it was a great experience and I hadn’t done anything like that before. I loved it.” Back home in Glasgow, McGinlay signed up with an extras agency and did a couple of adverts, one being for the Haig Club whisky, starring the brand collaborator David Beckham and the stunning Scottish landscape, directed by Guy Ritchie. “It was just five days’ shooting, but I got to know Guy quite well and that was a turning point for me. I was standing in Glencoe looking down at Guy behind the monitor and [cinematographer] John Mathieson behind the camera and [film pilot] Marc Wolff taking shots of Beckham riding his motorbike up Glencoe, and that was it for me. So many great movies were made there, like Skyfall, and it felt so cinematic, although it was an advert. I decided: when I come off this I’m gonna go back, quit my job, move to London at least give it a go. If it doesn’t work out, then, you know, it’s not worked out…”But it did work out: within four months McGinlay had an agent, auditioned for Ritchie’s King Arthur and landed the part of Sir Percival. “It was very hard to give up my job because it was going well and I did love it, but I can always go back. I wanted to keep going with the wave, having done the advert, met Guy, wanted to keep the pace going and move to London. So that was another turning point: I moved down and did King Arthur, then got Knightfall.” With Chris Pine famously watching Scottish rugby captains on YouTube to prepare for his role of Robert the Bruce in Outlaw King, McGinlay has the advantage, being the real McGinlay and able to jink the middle man. For him, the worlds of rugby and acting are not so far apart. “There are similarities, things like bulking up and getting fit and ‘in the zone’. How I prepared in the dressing room as a rugby player is still how I build up for a fight scene or any kind of fight choreography. You pump yourself up for it. Outlander was the same, marching at the head of a mob, you’ve got to get yourself into a zone and turn yourself into a dferent character. “Running out onto a sports field you have to play a character a bit as well. You’ve got to make that last tackle, be aggressive, stand up for yourself. Rugby’s about teamwork and it’s the same in acting – costume, hair, make-up, director, producer, writer, everyone’s trying to do their best.”As someone who never seems to stand stillit’s time for McGinlay to catch his next flight. “I’m not in any way there or where I want to be yet. It’s very early stages. I’m still massively learning. I’ve had a few good short film roles, three good roles in three big productions so far and this is the fourth one now, so it’s going well, but I’m still way, way short of where I want to be. “I’ve not made it or anything. I still have a long, long way to go and I’m very ambitious. If I quit my job to move into this, then I’m not in it for a laugh, I’m in it to go as far as I can.” Craig McGinlay can currently be seen in Season  of Outlander, available to watch now on Amazon Prime.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4839042.1543933465!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit downing street rejects legal opinion on article 50","story":"Downing Street has rejected a legal opinion arguing that the UK should have the right to unilaterally revoke Article  and stop Brexit.The European Court of Justiceadvocate general Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona rejected the contention that Article  only allows the possibility of revocation following a unanimous decision of the European Council.Instead, he said Article  allows the “unilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded”.: UK can cancel Brexit, according to top law officerThe case to decide whether an EU member state such as the UK can decide on its own to revoke the Article  withdrawal process, or whether the agreement of the  other member states would be required, was brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians.But the Prime Ministers official spokesman told reporters in Westminster \"this is not a final judgment\" and \"it does nothing in any event to change the clear position of the Government that Article  is not going to be revoked\".A full ruling is expected in the coming days and could be issues before the Commons votes on Theresa May’s Brexit deal on  December.: Campaigners welcome declaration that UK can cancel Brexit unilaterallyJudges at the ECJ accept the recommendation of the advocate general in a majority of cases.Responding to the opinion Catherine Stihler, the Labour MEP for Scotland and a member of the group involved in the legal process, said: “There is now light at the end of the tunnel.\"©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4838995.1543937252!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotch whisky association backs theresa may s brexit deal","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Scotch Whisky Associationhas given its support to Theresa May#s Brexit deal and warned MPs that rejecting it will create #considerable uncertainty#.It urged MPs to take its position into account in the critical Commons vote next week.The industry body published a Brexit briefing, stating: “On balance, the draft Withdrawal Agreement and accompanying Political Declaration on the Future UK-EU Relationship stand up well against the Scotch Whisky industry’s Brexit priorities. -

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: Libya trade envoy role ‘very interesting’Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":null,"title":"john bercow tells mps arguable case contempt committed by government over brexit legal advice","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Brexit backstop could continue indefinitely, Government legal advice suggests Brexit: What do the Government’s legal position papers say  Opposition parties complained, after a fractious two-and-a-half-hour debate, that the summary legal advice released by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox did not comply with a Commons resolution agreed on November . Mr Cox, who is the Governments chief legal adviser, had staunchly defended the decision - telling MPs \"there is nothing to see here\". The Speaker however, in a statement to the Commons, said he was \"satisfied\" the matter should be put before MPs to consider on Tuesday morning. He said: \"The letter that I received from the members mentioned at the start of this statement asks me to give precedence to a motion relating to privilege in relation to the failure of ministers to comply with the terms of the resolution of the House of the  November.\" Mr Bercow stopped his statement to scold Government chief whip Julian Smith, who was talking to ministers on the frontbench, saying: \"It would seem courteoushe could just hold off for a moment and allow me to make the statement that would appear to show perhaps a proper politeness.\" He added: \"I have considered the matter carefully and I am satisfied that there is an arguable case that a contempt has been committed. Im therefore giving precedence for a motion to be tabled tonight before the House rises and to be taken as first business tomorrow.\" Mr Bercow said it was \"entirely for the House to decide on that motion\". The Attorney General earlier said that he \"fully accepts\" MPs may impose a sanction against him or the Government for contempt of Parliament over Brexit legal advice. He said: \"The House has at its disposal the means by which to enforce its will. \"It can bring a motion of contempt and seek to have that motion passed and seek to impose through the committee, or whichever way it is appropriately done, to impose a sanction. I fully accept that. \"I dont set myself up contrary to the House, I simply say that I cannot compromise the public interest.\" Mr Cox had asked MPs to suppose the advice included details on relationships with foreign states and arguments that might be deployed in the future, noting: \"Would it be right for the Attorney General, regardless of the harm to the public interest, to ulge his opinion. \"I say it wouldnt.\" Mr Cox said it would be dficult to ensure information would be redacted, adding: \"I cannot take a step that I firmly and truly believe would be contrary to the public interest\". He went on: \"I ask the House to understand that it is only that consideration that is motivating me and this Government in declining at this stage to break the convention that applies to both sides of the House when they are in government. \"There is nothing to see here.\""},{"url":null,"title":"brexit would uk membership of the eea work","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sinn Fein MP Orfhlaith Begley welcomed the confirmation the project would go ahead.“This groundbreaking project will undoubtedly improve connectivity across the north west and create direct links to Dublin,\" the Sinn Fein MP said.“Recent fatalities on the A have once again reflected the need for enhanced infrastructure to improve road safety on one of the most dangerous roads in Ireland.\"Managing Director of the Construction Employers Federation John Armstrong said other departments should use their new powers to start work on projects.It is now critical that all government departments follow the lead of the DfI by seeking to utilise the powers of the new legislation to bring forward a range of capital works, both public and private sector, which are currently unable to progress for a iety of reasons,\" he said. “It is also critical that we see consistency in application of the Act and its associated guidance by all Government Departments as it must, in the continued absence of Ministers, be the means by which greater certainty can be applied to all levels of public sector construction works”."},{"url":null,"title":"teachers left without salaries after snap closure of grafton college union says","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

BelfastBrexit survey: Have your say and you could win a £ Amazon voucher UUP leader Robin Swann said his party was prepared to look at all the alternatives to Theresa Mays \"unacceptable\" current deal but he stressed that any solution must be \"UK-wide\".Sinn Fein said the DUP couldnt negotiate their own agreement and there already was a Brexit deal on the table. NI boss is called ‘Tory cow’ for May support Speaking to BBC Radio s Today programme yesterday, Mrs Foster said she would not support calls for a second Brexit referendum, as the UK had already voted to leave and \"we respect that\". Repeating the DUPs opposition to Mrs Mays deal, she urged the Prime Minister to \"not waste time\" on it and instead look for a better solution to the border question.She hinted thatthe current Withdrawal Agreement failed to get through the House of Commons, her party could be open to a Norway plus style arrangement, where the whole of the UK stayed in the customs union until an agreement with the EU is reached on future trading relations. Would membership of the EEA work  Ms Foster said the DUPs \"one red line\" was to make sure Northern Ireland was not dferentiated from the rest of the UK in terms of customs and was \"not prescriptive\" about other potential options on the future relationship with the EU.But a Norway plus-style arrangement has been rejected by the TUV leader.Mr Allister told the Belfast : \"It would retain us fully within the EU single market, subject to all Brussels-made rules - adjudicated by the European Court of Justice - and maintain free movement of labour and require ongoing payments to the EU. That is not Brexit. Brexit: Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal \"But for us it would be worse, because the Norway plus that is being talked about would additionally keep Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU - completing the repudiation of the Brexit that was voted for. Thus, the backstop would essentially still apply.\"Mr Allister continued: \"The core of the backstop is that Northern Ireland alone remains part of the customs territory of the EU.\"With the EU likely to only agree a Norway-style deal which had this add-on, it would leave us incarcerated in the EU in perpetuity.\"The UUP did not appear to rule out a Norway plus style arrangement. Mr Swann said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give our support to the Withdrawal Agreement and its disastrous backstop. However, we will look at every option and assess its merits - but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir said: \"There already is a deal on the table - its not perfect but it avoids physical infrastructure on the border.\"The DUP cannot negotiate their own deal. Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though. But she said this was a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland there would never be a hard border in place.Mrs May also rejected the claim that passing her Brexit deal in Parliament without the DUPs support would lead to the end of her partnership with Mrs Fosters party.\"Actually, the DUP have themselves said that the confidence-and-supply agreement remains in place,\" she stated.Mrs May refused to be drawn on what would happenMPs down the Withdrawal Agreement. But she insisted a second referendum was not an option as it could not be held before March ,  when Britain leaves the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"how does the brexit deal debate in the house of commons work","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But what will happen .push– What is the current plan The Government has allotted time on five days for the deal to be debated. This includes up to eight hours of debate on December , ,  and  – with the votes expected on December . Amendments have been tabled by two Labour MPs to extend the time for debate.– What are they debating The Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by the Government, which outlines the terms on which the UK will leave the EU and the desired future relationship. MPs are being asked to approve this by supporting a motion tabled by the Prime Minister.– Can MPs change what has been put forward Yes. Speaker John Bercow can select up to six amendments which MPs can then vote on.– What are the amendments Various amendments have been tabled. Labour’s official proposal would decline to approve Mrs May’s Brexit deal and explains this is because it fails to provide for a permanent UK-EU customs union and “strong” single market deal. It also voices concerns over Northern Ireland.Labour’s amendment also outlines that MPs will “pursue every option” that prevents the UK leaving the EU on the terms of Mrs May’s deal or leaving without a deal.Tory and Labour backbenchers have also tabled an amendment which seeks to reject Mrs May’s deal while also avoiding a no-deal Brexit.– What will happen with the votes It’s hard to say. Some  Conservative MPs have said publicly they will vote against Mrs May’s deal,  have said they will not vote in favour and more than  have said they are unhappy with it.With Mrs May’s minority government allies the DUP also expressing their own concerns, the chance of the deal being approved with a simple majority of  of the  MPs eligible to vote is highly unlikely.Any amendment would need to appeal to a wide enough group of MPs to receive the required votes to be successful. Abstentions are likely on all votes.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  – How does the debate work Ministers are expected to open and close each day, with the Opposition frontbench also having their say. MPs will be chosen by the Speaker to make speeches although their seniority – including positions previously held in government – usually influences the running order. A time limit is likely on backbench speeches, with MPs fearing it could be as low as four minutes.It is the decision of the MP speaking on whether they accept interventions from others during their speech.– What does a vote involve MPs walk through ision lobbies – in essence, rooms either side of the Commons chamber known as the ayes and noes. They have eight minutes to reach the ision lobbies when a vote is called.They register their vote on a tablet device and the result is usually announced within  minutes of the vote being called.If there is more than one vote, MPs tend to wait in the chamber and the process is repeated.– What about the House of Lords They will spend three days debating the deal on December ,  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"couple who lost engagement ring down a new york grate are identified","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint. Photovoltaic cells which have been fitted on the roof help heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas.In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns it into warm air, while so-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building, with everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to builders and the councillors who supported it financially, delighted at the opening of a new chapter in the history of local leisure provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget on the ball helping families dealing with dementia  ","story":"BALLYGALGET GAC has been recognised for its effort in helping people who live with dementia in an award ceremony recently.John Mitchelrsquos GAC received the award after teaming up with the Alzheimerrsquos Society to become the first GAA club to take on the Dementia Friendly programme.This award recognises the work members do to ensure everyone affected with dementia in their parish and beyond gets the support they need.Brendan Birt, a spokesperson for the club, explained that the club had been crossing every cultural and religious ide since it was founded in .He said that in that time the club had attended to the needs of everyone who live in what is a very rural part of the Ards Peninsula.ldquoWe are delighted to win this award in recognition of the work that has been done by our club and in the community, he remarked.ldquoThe first initiative of our new award-winning health and wellbeing centre was to become a dementia friendly community. We already have  trained dementia friends and that is growing.ldquoAs the first GAA club, we wanted to get involved because of the many people within our community who are living with dementia. This has raised the profile and understanding of dementia within our club and parish.Although this project is in its infancy, two dementia friendly community workshops have already been delivered creating  dementia friends, not only in Ballygalget but in the surrounding areas too.Future plans include extending the dementia friends initiative to two neighbouring GAA clubs and to hold a workshop in the local primary school.Bernadine McCrory, Country Director for Alzheimerrsquos Society, said: ldquoIt is amazing that John Mitchelrsquos GAC has won the Championing Diversity award and it is a testament to their tremendous work they do.ldquoThe level of nominations received this year was truly phenomenal and there were some exceptional stories heard at the awards ceremony.ldquoWe want everyone affected by dementia to know that whoever you are, whatever you are going through, you can turn to Alzheimerrsquos Society for support, help and advice.She added: ldquoAll the finalists and winners at the Dementia Friendly Awards have demonstrated how we can unite against dementia and support those affected by the condition..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch edge derby tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an ugly derby win in front of a large home crowd and banished a few memories from the three defeats to Banbridge last season which cost them promotion.The home side were almost at full strength, with Peter Nelson at full back, Kyle McCall ing in the front row and Johnny McPhillips sprung from the bench in the second half. Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -. Relief rather than elation from the home supporters as they made their way home.Ballynahinch Banbridge AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Chairman gives his backing to ‘green’ off road paths scheme  ","story":"A CAMPAIGN to connect Downpatrick with the Rowallane area via a series of off-road paths has secured the backing of the districtrsquos first citizen.A delegation of residents met recently with Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin to discuss extending the existing Quoile River walk towards Killyleagh. A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

Last year five pupils were retained and this term eight were held back.The practice was put under the microscope by the Education Boardrsquos Educational Services Committee recently when a committee member asked for it to be discontinued.Mr J Scott said he was concerned that all children should have equal opportunities and that no pupils should have an advantage over othersCROSSGAR mdash The threat of closure that has been overshadowing the future of Crossgar War Memorial Hall was lted at a special public meeting. Over  local residents rallied in response to a desperate plea for help issued by the hallrsquos management committee.Lack of support and use of the hall forced the committee to present an ultimatums to the townsfolk to either take an interest in the hall, or have it closed down.This unprecedented appeal certainly produced results as Mr W J Cochrane said when he addressed a packed meeting.ldquoI am delighted to see so many people here, he said. ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet. It is vitally important that the hall is managed by a thoughtful and inventive committee to ensure a safe passage out of our present dficulties.ldquoUnless the committee can come up with ways of obtaining sustained financial assistance, the threat of closure is still real.Mr Cochrane explained that while many repairs had been carried out, there was still a lot to do.

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

A comprehensive design scheme would also have to be worked up.NI Water officials have also confirmed Saintfield is one of a number of towns across the Province which requires signicant investment to upgrade the existing infrastructure to carter for current and future demand.Rowallane politicians fear the moratorium on new development in Saintfield could potentially be in place for two years and have urged senior NI Water officials to do all they can to expedite the work that is required. They say the current ban will not only have a major impact on residents and developers, but the townrsquos economy.NI Waterrsquos Stephen Blockwell confirmed to Newry, Mourne and Down councillors that the drainage study will not be completed until next December. He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Can the government get some changes to the agreement and then bring it back to parliament and get it through “The key change they would need would be to take out the bit of the agreement which says we can’t get out of the backstop. They already have a paragraph drafted which never went to the EU, but it basically says the UK can leave the backstopthey find it unsatisfactory.“I suspect that’s what the government will try, but this is going to be very dficult, because particularly Dublin has been saying for two years they won’t accept any backstop which isn’t permanent.“Dublin is just desperate to lock Northern Ireland into this agreement, which I think is something of a slow stairway to a united Ireland and I think they would regard it as one stepping stone in that direction. And having got the deal now they are not going to let it go without one hell of a fight.”Voicing his party’s concerns in the House of Commons, North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds described the withdrawal agreement as “deeply unattractive and unsatisfactory” and said the Attorney General should be recommending that it be rejected.With the government having repeatedly refused to publish the legal advice it received on Brexit in full, Mr Dodds later revealed that the speaker of the House of Commons has been asked to launch proceedings of contempt.“We have now written to the Speaker to ask him to launch proceedings of contempt. Parliament can not be ignored,” he tweeted.Meanwhile, the Secretary of State has claimed the people of Northern Ireland “want the government to get on with it” and deliver the best possible withdrawal deal.People want us to get on with Brexit, says NI Secretary Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Karen Bradley has been travelling around the Province over the past couple of weeks campaigning in support of Mrs May’s proposed agreement.try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

legal opinion","story":"Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona rejected the contention that Article  only allows the possibility of revocation following a unanimous decision of the European Council.Instead, he said Article  allows the ldquounilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded.Prime Minister Theresa Mayrsquos official spokesman told reporters in Westminster that ldquothis is not a final judgment, adding: ldquoIt does nothing in any event to change the clear position of the Government that Article  is not going to be revoked.The case to decide whether an EU member state such as the UK can decide on its own to revoke the Article  withdrawal process, or whether the agreement of the  other member states would be required, was brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians.A statement from the ECJ said: ldquoIn answer to the question from the Scottish court, the Advocate General proposes that the Court of Justice should, in its future judgment, declare that Article  TEU allows the unilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded, provided that the revocation has been decided upon in accordance with the member statersquos constitutional requirements, is formally notied to the European Council and does not involve an abusive practice.The opinion, which is not binding on the court, comes just a week after the case was heard at the ECJ following a referral from Scotlandrsquos highest civil court, the Court of Session.A judgment by the court will take place at a later date.Those who brought the case argue unilateral revocation is possible and believe it could pave the way for an alternative option to Brexit, such as a Peoplersquos Vote to enable remaining in the EU.Legal representatives for the UK Government believe the case is inadmissible as it deals with a hypothetical situation, since the Governmentrsquos policy is not to revoke Article .Lawyers representing the Council of the European Union and from the European Commission argue revocation is possible but would require unanimous agreement from all member states.#Brexit ndash Case C-  Wightman ndash AG Campos Saacutenchez-Bordona: Article  TFEU notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU can be revoked unilaterally under certain conditions https:t.co BXuldkaxWxmdash EU Court of JusticeDecember , The case was brought forward in February by a group of Scottish politicians ndash Labour MEPs Catherine Stihler and David Martin, Joanna Cherry MP and Alyn Smith MEP of the SNP, and Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, together with lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project.Their request for the Court of Session to refer the question of whether Article  can be unilaterally revoked to the ECJ was initially refused, before that ruling was overturned on appeal.Two attempts by the UK Government, which is contesting the case, to appeal against the referral to the European court were rejected.At the hearing last week, Aidan OrsquoNeill QC, representing the politicians who brought the case, said they need to know all their options on Brexit, including whether the UK can unilaterally halt the process ahead of critical votes on the withdrawal agreement.Advocate General for Scotland Lord Keen QC, representing the UK Government, said the case is a ldquohypothetical validity challenge and those behind it seek ldquopolitical ammunition to be used in, and to pressure, the UK Parliament.Hubert Legal, representing the Council of the European Union, said allowing unilateral withdrawal could lead to ldquodisaster, of which ldquothe main victim could be the European project altogether.He said Article  is ldquonot ambiguous, adding: ldquoThe prerogative of acting alone will have been exhausted by putting the notication letter on the councilrsquos table.Tory former attorney general and second referendum campaigner Dominic Grieve welcomed the ruling, telling BBC Radio rsquos Today: ldquoItrsquos clearly signicant.ldquoOf course it doesnrsquot necessarily have to be translated into a judgment, but the opinion of the advocate general is often very influential in forming the opinion of the court and it reinforces something I have to say I personally always thought was probably the case.Askedit made it more likely there would be a new public vote, he said: ldquoIt is certainly helpful because it removes one of the arguments, which is: lsquoOh well, they would never allow us to change our minds.Ms Cherry said:ldquoIrsquom particularly proud that itrsquos Scottish parliamentarians and the Scottish legal system who have ensured that this case will give all the nations of the UK the knowledge we need to extricate ourselves from the mess the Tories have created with their infighting over the EU.ldquoAnd I hope this will be remembered in the future when an independent Scotland looks to take her rightful place at the top table in Europe.Mr Smithsaid:ldquoWe now have a road map out of the Brexit shambles, a bright light has switched on above an lsquoexitrsquo sign and the  choice being offered to MPs at Westminster ndash that it is Mrs Mayrsquos disastrous deal or chaos ndash is shown for what it is, an abuse

Burnt out houses remain un-cleared sitting beside those that are still inhabited creating an atmosphere of dereliction and a breeding ground for rats and other vermin. Walkaways between houses have not been cleaned and neither have communal car parking areas.“Houses are in a poor state of repair with garden fences rotting and broken and window frames that have not been upgraded and are beginning to rot. Where it is clear some of these homes are private dwellings the question needs to be askedthere is any form of grant available to those occupants andso what efforts have been made to ensure they know about them.A derelict part of Craigavon“Without a doubt Legahory Court and Burnside are some of the most deprived areas not only in Central Craigavon but throughout the whole of Upper Bann. Those that live there must feel that they have been forgotten by the authorities and dare I say it politicians. If this situation was in central Lurgan, Portadown or Banbridge there would be an outcry from local civic leaders and community groups that would enable change, yet Legahory Court and Burnside remain forgotten, derelict and in need of serious investment. “As more and more money is invested in Craigavon improving the wealth and lives of all those in the area through jobs and wellbeing it is important that the ink spot of investment reaches these deprived areas. In calling for an urgent meeting of those responsible for this area I want to see something that will fundamentally change this area in the medium to long term.”Kate Evans said: “I have never seen anywhere in the local area in such a bad state of repair as I did while walking around Legahory Court and Burnside. As a mother I would have real concern letting my daughter out to playI resided there and genuinely believe that the poor state of some of the homes leaves the places looking like a slum.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre.

The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade.

Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”. Joining Ms Graham at the Banquet was guest speaker Jed Mercurio, creator of BBC hit dramas Bodyguard and Line of Duty.

It really is a fascinating mix of the old and the new.“With high ceilings, exposed brick feature walls, high quality wood flooring and the strikingly restored staircase from the entrance lobby, the space reflects innovative contemporary design.”The development is guiding a rental income of £, for each floor.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nick_web_1.jpg","title":"dale farm boss a no deal would be mad and disruptive for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Dale Farm chief executive Nick Whelan speaks to John Mulgrew about bringing pride to the business, growing profits, facing Brexit hurdles and expanding the dairy giant’s portfolio Nick Whelan took over at the helm of Northern Ireland’s largest dairy co-operative just as the UK decided it wanted to leave the world’s largest trading bloc.Now, marking two years in the role, after replacing long-time boss David Dobbin, he says he wanted to grow earnings and profit to more than £m, while ersying into product lines with bigger margins for the some , farmers which own the operation.At the time of writing, we still haven’t agreed what arrangement will be in place to safeguard the current trading freedoms Northern Ireland producers have. A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
