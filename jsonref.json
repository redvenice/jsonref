The government provides little opportunity for education and most will be forced to begin working from a young age to try and scratch a living amongst the shacks and railway lines of the cityOne photo shows a disabled man carrying a bowl through the streets, whilst another shows a man carrying heavy bricks on his shoulders.The breathtaking images were taken in Chittagong and Dhaka, Bangladesh, by Spanish civil servant and hobby photographer, Joxe Inazio Kuesta Garmendia, 59, from Lezo, Gipuzkoa, Spain.\u0027I went to Bangladesh without knowing anything about the country. I went around the streets capturing everything that happened around me with my camera. I saw people doing their usual chores and in their struggle to get ahead in very harsh living conditions,\u0027 said Joxe.\u0027I was surprised by the availability of people to be photographed. Everyone wanted to be photographed. I asked at the hotel the reasons for this and they told me it was because they thought that I worked for a documentary television channel and that they would appear on it.         Slum dwellers drinking chai tea and eating cakes at a cafe - a small respite from their otherwise bleak existence in the city of eight million in central Bangladesh. Dhaka is one of the most densely populated countries in the world where people must live in slums in dangerous and unhygienic conditions, packed closely together         A man\u0027s home in the city\u0027s slum, he sleeps in a ramshackle wooden structure, lying on a box which he has fitted with some rickety sloping shelves to house his few possessions. A few mugs can be seen beside a couple of boxes and scattered around his awful bed is a clapped out bicycle and other trinkets he has foraged which he hopes he can sell         Women sit on the train tracks in Dhaka with two children - one, an infant, who sits right in the middle of the tracks, oblivious to the harsh reality of his existence. The slum dwellers\u0027 shacks can be seen in the background, their washing lines strung out and corrugated iron shelters just feet away from the tracks where trains whistle down the line day and night         Stalls line the slums of Chittagong, a city of four million on the southeast coast of Bangladesh. The man on the left can be seen hunched over while he prepares tea, surrounded by his cups and a tea pot over the furnace, while another sits smoking a cigarette. To the right of their stall, a barefoot man operates a sewing machine, his face wrinkled with seriousness\u0027That could well have been true because many people showed me their products in the markets, but the truth is that they did not need to tell me anything to understand their situation, I saw it and it is seen in the photos.\u0027For me it was a total privilege to be out there walking around the streets and having some kind of relationship with these people. I loved approaching them and seeing their reactions, and so on.\u0027I was shocked many times by watching sick and disable people, many of them without limbs asking for help. It is hard to see people, especially children, working in extreme conditions like these.\u0027I have to admit that I even cried sometimes. I was surprised by the humanity and kindness of the people, they helped me at all times and treated me with great respect.\u0027When I travel, which is when I take pictures, I like to see and feel people of different races, religions and customs. I try to approach them with the intention of establishing, if possible, a relationship, which most of the time consists of a shared smile or a greeting.\u0027If I get to photograph them, I feel doubly happy. I look for the complicity with the people photographed because I think it is the only way to take this kind of photo.         A young skinny boy helps a bearded man to pull a trailer fitted to the back of a bike away from the dump, as they spend their days gathering junk which they hope can be sold so they might be able to earn enough just to get by in the brutal city. Many suffer undernourishment, disease and are vulnerable to crime in the densely populated slum land         Poor people\u0027s desperate faces press against a fence out on the street as they queue to collect rice provided by a rich man who was helping the community in Dhaka. For most, the desperate life of hunger is all they know and many of them will die or suffer disease as a result of their undernourishment         A young lad toils in a Dhaka shipyard beside a searing furnace as he smelts propellers for ships. His job is extremely dangerous and he wears little protections save for a shirt and trousers. His bare feet, arms and hands are visible as he works with molten metals in the busy shipyard to carry out orders         A man carries heavy bricks slung across his shoulders in a masonry yard by the Buriganga River after unloading them from a barge. With an abundance of cheap unskilled labour, the city is a throbbing hub of construction and transportation of goods, with the river filled with fishermen, freight ships and barges carrying materials from across the country\u0027One important characteristic of my photos is that the people who appear in them are calm, there is no violence in the shot and almost always there is a visual contact.\u0027Bangladesh is one of the most populous countries in the world with more than 1,100 people packed into every square kilometre and nearly a third of its population is living below the poverty line.More than two-million people in the capital Dhaka live in the slums and are without proper shelter. \u0027When I go out to photograph, I do not think that I have a message to convey, I just see and capture. I want people to know that I am photographing them, I want to express what they feel, what they have to say about their life and the environment that surrounds them,\u0027 Joxe said.         A man can be seen hunched over while holding a bowl of food outside his ramshackle home, while his wife prepares food with an array of pots and pans by the fire. Their son stands with nothing on his frame but a pair of pants, his feet bare and covered with filth. They live beside the railway tracks in Dhaka where huge trains thunder down the tracks all day long.         Women - their faces wrinkled, ravaged by time and stress - queue for a rare chance to get their hands on some charitably donated rice on the streets of Dhaka. The photographer said: \u0027I have to admit that I even cried sometimes. I was surprised by the humanity and kindness of the people, they helped me at all times and treated me with great respect\u0027         These children are the fortunate few whose family\u0027s have been able to send them to school in the slums, some of them can be seen holding books, while others look in from the window as their teacher stands over them. Many children do not get the chance to have even this basic education, their families being so poor they must go out to work at a young age         A boy wheels a disabled man through the streets of Dhaka - without adequate healthcare people do not receive the treatment they may need and there are little provisions made for those born with congenital conditions. If they are able to survive, they must improvise and build make-shift wheelchairs like the one above\u0027What I do is try to apply my vision in those realities. It is interesting to see the different reactions of people when seeing the pictures.\u0027Some people express admiration as soon as they see them, others only see the beauty of a look, some feel uncomfortable when seeing the environment in which those people, who look at us, live and there are also those who are indifferent.\u0027I want to say that if I manage to awaken those feelings that usually cost us so much to admit and express, then I do have the feeling that I am transmitting something.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Countdown pokes fun calls boycott Rachel Riley","story":"Share this article  Earlier this month Riley criticised a Labour councillor Jo Bird for making jokes about \u0027Jew process\u0027 and altering the words of a poem about the Holocaust during a speech.She called the comments \u0027stomach turning\u0027 and said anti-Semitism in the party is \u0027beyond a joke and deeply worrying\u0027.  In a recording leaked to the Jewish Chronicle of a meeting last year, Bird joked that the term \u0027due process\u0027 should be dubbed \u0027Jew process\u0027.     The meeting was in support of Marc Wadsworth, who was expelled from the party last April after haranguing Jewish MP Ruth Smeeth at the launch of a report into alleged anti-Semitism in the party.          Riley Tweeted this in response to an outpouring of support online as people rushed to her defence online And last month Riley threatened legal action against Twitter users alleged to have targeted and harassed her. Riley has said she suffered \u0027horrendous abuse\u0027 and has repeatedly clashed with Labour supporters, particularly over Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s handling of anti-Semitism allegations within party ranks.Her lawyer said he was preparing to take legal action against up to 70 people for libel or harassment of Riley and EastEnders actor Tracy Ann Oberman. Lawyer Mark Lewis said he was contacting \u0027between 60 and 70 people\u0027 who are \u0027almost exclusively Labour supporters\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"Outcry Pakistan weight lifting contest CAMELS","story":"Share this article \u0027Camels are intelligent, sensitive iniduals, and treating them as living cranes for human amusement adds to the many types of abuse, including their eventual slaughter.

The format of the map, using straight and diagonal lines and focusing on connections rather than geographical accuracy, is known as a Beck map after its creator, Harry Beck, who designed it in 1931. The core structure is very recognizable in this map, more than 100 years into the Underground\u0027s history, after it opened as the world\u0027s first underground passenger railway in 1863. However, Londoners will notice some of the aspects which are no longer accurate. This map predates the Victoria line, which began operation in 1968 the Jubilee line, which first opened in the 1970s and was extended to Stratford in 1999 and there is also no sign yet of the Docklands Light Railway, which opened in 1987.

The host nation played all their games at Wembley, a ground initially known as the Empire Stadium when it opened in 1923. Fans are advised to take trains, buses or Underground lines to get there and many of the instructions would still be accurate today, although the stadium itself was closed and knocked down in the early 2000s  and re-opened in 2007. Wembley was the venue for the final which saw England defeat West Germany 4-2, bringing the nation which invented the sport its only World Cup triumph to date. White City in fact hosted only one match, a first-round game between Uruguay and France in England\u0027s group, which the South Americans won 2-1.

After exhaustive negotiations a deal was finally made: Jumbo would be exchanged for one rhino, a kangaroo, one possum, a jackal, a pair of eagles and two dingoes. The young elephant made his debut at the London Zoo in 1865 but arrived in terrible health. He was put under the care of Matthew Scott, an animal trainer that would become Jumbo’s lifelong companion. Scott wrote in his autobiography: ‘The hoofs of the feet and the tail were literally rotten, and the whole hide was so covered with sores, that the only thing I can compare it to was the condition of the man of leprosy…’ Still considered a calf in the elephant life, Jumbo was just four feet tall when he arrived in London and Scott tirelessly nursed him back to health, forging an inseparable trust at an early age.           Jumbo with his handler Matthew Scott (left) and children at the London Zoo in 1882. Jumbo was the main attraction at the zoo for 17 years, beloved for his gentle nature, it was estimated that he gave hundreds of thousands of rides, most notably to a young Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt and Queen Victoria\u0027s children                           Jumbo waves to his trainer and lifelong companion, Matthew Scott at the London Zoo. Scott nursed Jumbo back to health when he arrived from the Paris in terrible condition. Scott wrote in his autobiography: \u0027The hoofs of the feet and the tail were literally rotten, and the whole hide was so covered with sores\u0027         Jumbo was an African Elephant, who weighed seven tons and stood almost 11 feet tall. Behind Jumbo’s docile daytime façade was a deeply disturbed elephant who was tormented by claustrophobia and night terrors. At night he would descend into violent rages, slamming his body against the walls of his cage which resulted in both of his tusks being snapped off. When they started to grow back, he ground them down against the walls of his pen         Barnum \u0026amp Bailey Circus poster, 1882. A London newspaper at the time described Jumbo, \u0027as gentle with children as the best trained poodle dog.\u0027 London was devastated to see their national talisman leave for AmericaAt first there was nothing to suggest that Jumbo would go on to become a world famous celebrity but over time he became a national treasure for Great Britain where he remained for 17 years. Patrons of the zoo were captivated by the gentle giant that stood 10 feet, 6 inches tall. Riding the majestic animal around Regent’s Park became the zoo’s main attraction and it’s estimated that Jumbo carried hundreds of thousands of guests by the 1880s most notably Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Queen Victoria’s children. The Graphic, a weekly newspaper in London at the time wrote that he was ‘was gentle with children as the best trained poodle dog, taking the proffered biscuit or lump of sugar with an almost incredible delicacy of touch.’ Jumbo became an institution for the zoo and a national pet for England.But behind Jumbo’s docile façade was a deeply troubled elephant who was plagued by claustrophobia, night terrors and the rats that relentlessly gnawed at his hooves. Things started to take a dramatic turn for the worse when Jumbo entered puberty and would descend into furious explosions of rage and aggression at night. He began charging the walls of his cage so mercilessly that both of his tusks snapped off and when they started to grow back, he whittled them down to nubs by grating them against his pen. In a 2017 documentary titled Attenborough and the Giant Elephant, the legendary naturalist examines the life of the famous elephant and said: ‘He would become possessed by terrifyingly violent rages in which he would smash the timbers of his enclosure.’Matthew Scott and Superintendent Abraham Bartlett took to more extreme measures in an attempt to tame Jumbo’s aggression. Bartlett wrote in his book: ‘Scott and myself, holding him by each ear, administered to him a good thrashing. He quickly recognized that he was mastered by lying down and uttering a cry of submission.’ Scott also took to other forms of corporal punishment, using a pointed hook to prod the tender parts of Jumbo’s body in order to get the response he needed.          To tremendous public outcry, Jumbo was sold to P.T. Barnum for $10,000 in 1882. It took three days to persuade Jumbo to walk in his travelling crate for the trans-Atlantic trip to America. Here Matthew Scott is pictured next to Jumbo outside the Elephant House at London Zoo on February 20, 1882. 15,000 people showed up to bid Jumbo adieu, bringing a host of goodbye presents (wine, beer, pastries, cake, 12 dozen oysters and a pumpkin) for the beloved elephant that was viewed as England\u0027s national pet         Sir David Attenborough examined the life of Jumbo in a 2007 documentary for the BBC. Looking at his skeleton, scientists discovered significant  damage to Jumbo\u0027s hips and knees, evidence of the damage done to his body while carrying heavy loads of people and pressure of captivityWith Jumbo’s flare-ups, it was only a matter of time before Jumbo was considered a risk to his caretakers and patrons. Furthermore, zoo administrators were worried that Jumbo’s sexual libido could not be controlled as he entered adolescence a massive elephant erection was far too unpalatable for the conservative morality of Victorian- era England. In 1882, Abraham Bartlett secretly arranged for Jumbo to be sold to P.T. Barnum for $10,000 (roughly $260,000 in today’s money). News of the deal dropped like an atomic bomb across the United Kingdom, 100,000 children wrote to Queen Victoria begging for her to take action, a lawsuit was filed against the zoo claiming the transaction unlawful and public protests were staged across the city.John Ruskin, a fellow of the zoological society wrote an open letter in The Morning Post: ‘I… am not in the habit of selling my old pets or parting with my old servants because I find them subject occasionally, perhaps even periodically, to fits of ill temper and I not only regret the proceedings of the council, but disclaim them utterly, as disgraceful to the city of London and dishonorable to common humanity.’15,000 people showed up to bid Jumbo farewell, bringing a host of goodbye presents for the beloved elephant pet: wine, beer, pastries and cakes. Jumbo and his companion, Matthew Scott boarded the ship to America for a destiny that would play out more tragically than his past. The cross-Atlantic trip was not easy for Jumbo confined in his small crate and prone to sea sickness. Scott got in the habit of sedating Jumbo with alcohol in order to keep him calm, a habit that would eventually turn Jumbo into a raging alcoholic. The Sun newspaper wrote, ‘…a bottle of whiskey was brought and opened before him, an operation which he watched with a great deal of interest, holding his trunk curved upward in readiness for the draught. While the liquor was being emptied into the nostrils of his huge prehensile nose he never moved, and when he got it all he carried it around to his mouth with such precision as not to spill a drop. Then he emitted a big sigh of satisfaction.\u0027In the Disney film, Dumbo and his friend, Timothy Q Mouse accidentally become intoxicated by drinking champagne spiked water. The scene leads to the psychedelic \u0027Pink Elephants on Parade\u0027 sequence in which Dumbo and Timothy hallucinate dancing neon elephants before they wake up hungover in a tree. The reality of those four minutes were in fact closer to Jumbo\u0027s truth than fiction.  By the time Jumbo arrived in New York City on April 10, 1882, he was already a sensation - 10,000 people lined the streets to watch the colossal animal celebrity make his way toward his permanent home at Madison Square Garden, the Barnum \u0026amp Bailey’s Circus headquarters. ‘The first seen of Jumbo was an enormous trunk, reaching far out from the front of his box, writhing and twisting in all directions,’ reported The Sun. He was unloaded from the ship at 9:00pm it took 200 men, 18 horses and two elephants to haul Jumbo’s crate up Broadway. By midnight he was finally home.          When Jumbo arrived in New York City in April 1882, The Sun newspaper reported, ‘The first seen of Jumbo was an enormous trunk, reaching far out from the front of his box, writhing and twisting in all directions.\u0027 It took took 200 men, 18 horses and two elephants pushing from the back to haul Jumbo\u0027s crate up to his permanent home at Madison Square Garden         Jumbo left London on April 1, 1882, thousands of fans lined the Millwall Docks to wave goodbye as  his crate as it was loaded onto ship bound for America with Matthew Scott standing on the platform to keep Jumbo calm. The two week journey turned out to be disastrous for Jumbo who was plagued by  sea-sickness. During this time, Scott got in the bad habit of sedating the elephant witch alcoholAmerica was struck by Jumbo-mania. In three weeks, P.T Barnum had already recouped the money he spent on the international super star. The circus had made $1.75million ($43million in 2019\u0027s money) in Jumbo’s first 31-week season, attendance broke all previous records. Jumbo was billed as ‘the largest elephant on the planet,’ with P.T. Barnum exaggerating his height by two feet. In actuality when Attenborough’s team analysed Jumbo’s skeleton in 2017, they exposed the physical toll his life in captivity had taken on his framework, specifically noticed in the significant injuries on his hips. Dr. Richard Thomas, from the University of Leicester, said: ‘He has many signs of stress and strain-related injuries. They must have been incredibly painful for him but may have reflected the use to which he was put.’ In addition to this, Jumbo suffered painful joint problems more commonly associated with elephants in their 40s or 50s. ‘When we look at the knee we see all sorts of kind of changes in the bone that we wouldn’t really expect to see in an elephant his age. Remember Jumbo’s only 24 and still growing,’ said Dr. Thomas in the documentary.         P.T. Barnum was a shrewd businessman and American entertainment impresario responsible for the Barnum \u0026amp Bailey circus   Jumbo logged in 32,000 miles on the road for the circus, tamed by Scott’s hook and copious amounts of alcohol to keep him calm. At night, when Jumbo was shackled to his crate, he chugged kegs of beer and downed bottles of champagne and whisky while his favorite treat was booze saturated biscuits.Only three years after Jumbo joined ‘The Greatest Show on Earth,’ his life came to a dramatic end on September 15, 1885 in Ontario, Canada. Jumbo and his petite elephantine companion Tom Thumb (named after Barnum\u0027s other diminutive side show act) had finished their performance early for the evening and were in the process of being led to their box cars by Maxwell Scott after the show. Suddenly, Scott heard the distant sound of a freight train chugging down the tracks in their direction. Panicked, he was unable to maneuver Jumbo and Tom Thumb into safety quick enough and within seconds, the oncoming locomotive slammed into Jumbo’s backside, bringing him to his knees and causing the train to derail. Jumbo was brutally pushed under the heavy iron carriage of a circus car idling on the opposite track nearby, which in turn, crushed his massive skull and drove a tusk back into his brain.It took Jumbo 15 minutes to die, and Matthew Scott draped his body across the celebrated animal and wept audibly for hours. Vandals instantly descended on the opportunity to preserve a piece history, callously cutting off pieces of Jumbo’s body as souvenirs. The New York Times reported: ‘The great beast gave one groan after being struck. Then he assumed an attitude of determination, which he maintained until the sands of his life ran out.’          Mathew Scott poses in front of Jumbo\u0027s lifeless body after he died in a shocking, freak train accident in St. Thomas, Ontario Canada on September 15, 1985. Jumbo was struck by an oncoming freight train as Scott attempted to load him and fellow elephant, Tom Thumb onto their boxcars after the performanceP.T. Barnum was not prepared to let Jumbo’s death cheat him of potential profits in effect he said ‘the show must go on!’ The great entertainment impresario devised a plan to make a spectacle of Jumbo’s mounted body and within a day, he hired Henry Ward, a leading taxidermist to take on the massive endeavor. Ward stretched Jumbo’s skin so in the end, he stood 13 feet tall, two feet taller than his actual height. ‘If I can’t have Jumbo living, I’ll have Jumbo dead, and Jumbo dead is worth a small herd of ordinary elephants,’ said Barnum to the New York Times on September 17, 1885. Thus Jumbo spent the next four years on tour with his skeleton before P.T. Barnum donated it to the Natural History Museum in New York City and his taxidermed body to Tufts University.A post-mortemexamination of his stomach pointed to painful years of improper care. According to report in Martin Meredith’s book titled ‘Elephant Destiny,’ Jumbo’s stomach contained a ‘hat-full of English pennies, gold and silver coins, stones, a bunch of keys, lead seals from railway trucks, trinkets of metal and glass, screws, rivets, pieces of wire and a police whistle.’For eight decades, Jumbo’s mounted body was proudly displayed as the school mascot in Barnum Hall at Tufts University. Devastation struck again in 1975 after a fire broke loose, burning the entire building with Jumbo inside to a heap of ash. Some of those ashes were saved in a Peter Pan Peanut Butter jar which remains to this day on the desk of the athletic director. In time, Jumbo\u0027s very name would enter the language, his massive stature, and his great outsized celebrity would become a kind of metaphor for sheer overpowering bigness. The name itself was taken from the Swahili word \u0027jumbe\u0027 which means \u0027chief\u0027 the perfect appellation for the elephant that taught us the transformative love for animals.          After Jumbo\u0027s  untimely death in 1885,  P.T. Barnum continued to make massive profits by travelling with Jumbo\u0027s skeleton and mounted body before eventually donating the skeleton to the Natural History Museum in New York City and his taxidermed body to Tufts University          Jumbo became a cottage industry not just in London but in America as well, his image was used to sell everything from cotton spools to \u0027Mrs\u0027 Pott\u0027s cold handle sad irons\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/03/29/17/11629526-0-image-a-3_1553882385793.jpg","title":"A snap general election leave Parliament divided","story":"Share this article A clutch of Leave-backing Conservatives including former Cabinet ministers Owen Paterson and Sir John Redwood and European Research Group vice-chairman Steve Baker made clear they will continue to oppose the agreement reached with the remaining 27 EU states in November.And DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said the Northern Irish party\u0027s 10 MPs will vote against the agreement because it \u0027betrays the wishes of the vast majority of people who voted to leave\u0027.

Photograph: Alan Betson A “string of statutory instruments” – the equivalent of substantive legislation – will be finalised over the coming days as part of preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit, the Attorney General has said.Séamus Woulfe told a law conference in Dublin that the statutory instruments were required beyond the Government’s omnibus legislation to prepare the State for a potential disorderly UK exit from the EU. His remarks came moments after British prime minister Theresa May’s proposed orce deal with the EU was rejected by MPs for a third time.“Work is ongoing and remains a big priority and will be completed in the next few days in case it is necessary. But please God it won’t be,” he told the Annual Construction Law Conference.The aim was to have the instruments “done a week ago”. But the delay in Brexit Day to April 12th at the earliest gave the Government “a little more breathing space”, he told the conference.The Government has said that the 28 statutory instruments where secondary legislation is needed is to cover areas from recognition of driver licences and qualifications to immigration and data exchange.In his speech, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Mr Justice Frank Clarke warned that the “basic legal structure” underpinning judicial co-operation between Ireland and the UK would “disappear” in a cliff-edge Brexit.He offered the example of Irish courts directing troubled children who require residential care to be treated in UK facilities under EU law as one area that could be affected after Britain leaves the bloc.“There are a range of areas that may take some time to put in replacement measures and the shape of those replacement measures are not clear at this stage,” he told the conference at the Distillery Building near the Four Courts.He expected a lot of “ad hoc” solutions being introduced and “judge to judge discussions” after Brexit until the parameters of the future relationship between the EU and the UK are agreed.“I suspect it won’t be perfect,” he said.He also warned that there will be “significant limitations” on Ireland’s ability to co-operate on judicial matters in bilateral arrangements with the UK because the State is bound by EU law.The Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Sir Declan Morgan, told the conference he expected problems with co-operation, that judges, North and South, would not be able to solve in a hard Brexit.Will the judiciary be cautious?He agreed with the Mr Justice Frank Clarke that issues could be solved “in a practical and sensible way”. But he also warned that “the political temperature is through the roof” in Britain and Northern Ireland and it would be “difficult getting people signed up to do that without appearing to be interfering with the Brexit process”.Judicial co-operation after a no-deal Brexit had “to be extremely carefully handled”, he said. Judges had to make sure they acted “within the territory that is available to us as judges and don’t stray into territory that at the moment politicians think they occupy or want to occupy”, he added.As Sir Declan was addressing the conference, the Mr Justice Frank Clarke handed him a note telling him Mrs May had lost her third attempt at getting her orce deal passed by the House of Commons.“She got closer this time,” he said, in response, to laughter from delegates. “She only lost by 58 votes. That’s a victory these days.”Mr Woulfe expressed concern that the judicial co-operation envisaged in the EU-UK political declaration on a future relation was “quite narrow and quite limited” because it aimed to explore co-operation in matrimonial and parental responsibility but did not address civil and commercial matters.He described the omnibus no-deal Brexit legislation, enacted this month but not yet commenced, as one of the most remarkable pieces of legislation ever passed because “so much work went into such a concentrated piece of legislation with everybody hoping and praying that it would never come into effect.”Mr Woulfe said it was a “shocking waste of time and effort”, but that “it had to be done” to prepare for a hard Brexit which “happily looks less likely today.”Still, he warned that the UK could “stumble” into a no-deal departure even though Westminster did not want it.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: EPASTEPHANIE LECOCQOn what was supposed to be B-Day, Chancellor Angela Merkel took a Brexit break on Friday for a one-day trip to Assisi in Italy.There she is presenting the city’s “Lamp of Peace” award to King Abdullah of Jordan and, on a visit to the religious order founded there by St Francis, a piece of the Berlin Wall.Three decades after Germany’s hard border vanished, the leader who grew in its eastern shadow is deeply concerned at the prospect of a new, hard border in western Europe on April 12th.That is the new, worst-case Brexit scenario after EU leaders gave Theresa May a fresh deadline a week ago to “indicate a way forward”. If the House of Commons in London fails to vote for or reject her Brexit deal, as EU officials fear, the way forward for the UK on in two weeks’ time is off a political cliff.At the same moment as the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal, the inner-Irish Border would become an outer EU barrier. And the Government faces the ultimate political Catch-22 dilemma: how to simultaneously meet its EU treaty obligations to police an outer border of the bloc with its Belfast Agreement promise to respect the open Border.Until now EU leaders have maintained a constructive silence on the issue of this political and customs border but, if no solutions are likely from London, by next week they will want answers from Dublin.From the start, the German leader has taken an intense interest in Brexit, but - knowing that too much public interest was ripe for over-interpretation - has deferred in public to EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.Long before May visited Berlin after the Brexit vote, Taoiseach Enda Kenny was in Berlin to make the Irish case: Dublin was staying in the EU and expected full EU solidarity on the road ahead.Leo Varadkar repeated those messages at a joint press conference exactly a year ago in Berlin.For her part Merkel described the Border question then as a “very sensitive issue of central importance” in which “Germany supports the Irish position completely”.A day later, in the first Bundestag address of her fourth term, Ireland’s Brexit concerns was the only point she mentioned by name in a busy European political agenda. She also sent a clear signal to British officials still holding out hope that she could be relied on for shuttle diplomacy.The German leader said she hoped for “friendly, close” relations with the UK - “but of course the relationship of the UK to the EU - given its wish to leave the single market and customs union - cannot be as close as today”.That was music to the ears of Irish officials, hyper-sensitive to any changes of mood, colour or temperature in German remarks. Since then, they insist, things have remained consistent. The German leader has never veered from the script, understanding the need for total discipline with Dublin. She has tolerated no Brexit solo runs from her officials, party backbenchers or even business leaders. Holding the line with Dublin is about holding Europe together - a priority for every German postwar leader.Though that discipline has held, the German leader has been increasing pressure on Mr Varadkar in private - during phone calls and at EU leaders’ meetings in Brussels - on how he purposes to square the Brexit circle. On a trip to Japan in February she suggested a “creative” approach to Brexit could see outstanding backstop questions pushed into talks on the future EU-UK relationship.“We have an agreement for the future relationship, and in this future relationship one can of course address the questions that now still have to be discussed, for instance the questions that have to do with the backstop,” she said.“There are no doubt possibilities to ensure, on the one hand, the integrity of the single market . . . even when Northern Ireland’s doesn’t belong to it because it belongs to the UK, and the wish, if possible, to allow for no controls on the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and to solve this point.”After a crisis-filled 14 years on the EU stage, Merkel is Europe’s longest-serving leader. She has shown an astonishing capacity to swallow entire forests of EU paper-work on bailouts, banking union and more. She loves gristly detail, and those in the know say the German leader has become an expert on the finer points of the Belfast Agreement.What if, she wants to know from the Taoiseach, Ireland becomes a victim of the law of unintended consequences and his insistence on the backstop causes a no-deal Brexit - vaporising the backstop and forcing a hard border? She may be in her final political act, but German leader is coming to Ireland to show solidarity - and get answers.November marks the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. At the 25th anniversary in 2014, Dr Merkel said her stellar political career was proof that “nothing has to stay as it is”. Borders can fall and, she added, political “dreams can come true.” After elbowing his way to the top job in Dublin Varadkar now knows: nightmares too.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: AFPGettyThe European Commission has said that a no-deal Brexit is now a “likely scenario” after Theresa May’s latest vote on the Brexit withdrawal agreement was defeated by 58 votes.It comes as Donald Tusk announced European Union leaders will meet on April 10th to discuss Britain’s departure from the bloc.“In view of the rejection of the withdrawal agreement by the House of Commons, I have decided to call a European Council on April 10th,” he said.In response to the vote results, the European Commission said the benefits of the withdrawal agreement, including a transition period, will “in no circumstances be replicated in a no-deal scenario”.“The Commission regrets the negative vote in the House of Commons today,” it said in a statement. “The EU. . . is now fully prepared for a ‘no-deal’ scenario at midnight on April 12th.”The Commission also said orce terms without the failed withdrawal agreement would be much worse. “The benefits of the withdrawal agreement, including a transition period, will in no circumstances be replicated in a ‘no-deal’ scenario. Sectoral mini-deals are not an option.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said European Union leaders must be open to a long extension if Britain decides to fundamentally reconsider its Brexit approach, adding that such a request would result in a generous response.But Mr Varadkar also warned of the growing risk of a disruptive no-deal Brexit, after British lawmakers rejected for a third time the withdrawal agreement negotiated by prime minister Theresa May and the EU.The Taoiseach\u0026nbspsaid it is “not clear” that the UK has fully understood a no-deal Brexit is off the agenda, saying no deal is a “growing possibility”.“Ireland has been preparing intensively for a no-deal scenario. But no one should underestimate the difficulties that a no deal will present, for all of us, including the UK.”Crunch voteThe House of Commons rejected the agreement by 344-286 votes at 2.30pm following a tense debate.The result of the crunch vote means that the UK has missed an EU deadline to secure an extension of the Brexit process and leave with a deal on May 22nd.Mrs May now has until April 12th to go back to Brussels with new proposals and seek a longer extension to the negotiation process, or see the UK leave without a deal that day.Mrs May, raising a point of order after the defeat, said: “I think it should be a matter of profound regret to every member of this House that once again we have been unable to support leaving the European Union in an orderly fashion.“The implications of the House’s decision are grave.“The legal default now is that the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on April 12th — in just 14 days’ time.“This is not enough time to agree, legislate for and ratify a deal, and yet the House has been clear it will not permit leaving without a deal. And so we will have to agree an alternative way forward.”The Democratic Unionist Party has\u0026nbspsaid it “regrets” that insufficient progress has been made on the deal and have been unable to back the withdrawal agreement.Backstop“The Democratic Unionist Party has consistently and repeatedly indicated that we could not support the withdrawal agreement because of the construction of the backstop,” the DUP’s Nigel Dodds said.“We have said that were the backstop to become operational Northern Ireland would sit in a separate legal position from the rest of the United Kingdom in economic and trade terms.“We have encouraged the Government to do, as Dominic Raab has said, to return to Brussels on these issues and not simply to accept the position of the European Union as being unalterable.“We deeply regret the numerous missed opportunities by those who negotiated on behalf of the UK to listen to our warnings about the dangers of the backstop and to take steps to remedy those deficiencies.The Brexiteer group ERG has called for Theresa May’s resignation, saying it must be the final defeat for Mrs May’s deal.“It’s finished. And we must move on.“It has not passed. It will not pass. I regret to say it is time for Theresa May to follow through on her words and make way so that a new leader can deliver a withdrawal agreement which can be passed by parliament.”Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn called for Mrs May to step aside and for a general election to be held. Mr Corbyn said: “This is now the third time the prime minister’s deal has been rejected.“The House has been clear this deal now has to change. There has to be an alternative found.“If the prime minister can’t accept that then she must go. Not at an indeterminate date in the future, but now, so that we can decide the future of this country through a general election.”In a special Friday sitting of the Commons, MPs were debating the legally binding treaty segment of the prime minister’s Brexit deal, but not the accompanying Political Declaration setting out plans for the future EUUK relationship. – PAReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:   Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesTheresa May has hinted at a snap general election and a long delay to Brexit after MPs rejected the withdrawal agreement by 344 votes to 286, a majority of 58 votes. Speaking in the House of Commons after the vote, the prime minister described the implications of the decision as “grave”, adding that the default position was that Britain would leave the EU in just two weeks on April 12th.“I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House. This House has rejected no deal. It has rejected no Brexit. On Wednesday it rejected all the variations of the deal on the table.\u0026nbspAnd today it has rejected approving the Withdrawal Agreement alone and continuing a process on the future. This government will continue to press the case for the orderly Brexit that the result of the referendum demands,” she said.\u0026nbspA Downing Street spokesman declined three times to deny that a general election is now on the table, although that would require a lengthy extension to the article 50 deadline. Mrs May said that parliament would not allow Britain to leave without a deal so if MPs do not approve her Brexit deal before an emergency EU summit on April 10th, she will request a long extension.Such an extension would require Britain to participate in European Parliament elections on May 23rd and has to be approved by all 27 other EU member-states. Mrs May announced this week that she will resign as prime minister if her Brexit deal is approved and the Conservatives could face a leadership election ahead of any general election.Parliament Square rallyWhile MPs were debating the withdrawal agreement, pro-Brexit protesters held a rally in Parliament Square to mark the day Britain was due to leave the EU.A number of high profile Conservative Brexiteers, including Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Dominic Raab, voted with the government in favour of the withdrawal agreement. But 28 hardline Brexiteers voted against it, alongside six Conservative Remainers, the DUP and the opposition parties. Just five Labour MPs voted for the agreement.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister should accept after the latest defeat that her Brexit deal is unacceptable and urged her to call a general election.“The House has been clear, this deal now has to change. There has to be an alternative found. And if the prime minister can’t accept that then she must go, not at an indeterminate date in the future but now.\u0026nbspSo that we can decide the future of this country through a general election.”Next Monday, MPs will take part in the second stage of indicative voting on alternatives to the prime minister’s Brexit deal. In the first round on Wednesday, they rejected all eight options put before them but they hope to whittle down the options next week.Downing Street on Friday declined to rule out a further attempt to win parliamentary approval for the Brexit deal if speaker John Bercow allows it.\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Video: BBC\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNick Watt on BBC’s Newsnight programme on Thursday nightIt is perhaps one of the most succinct and honest pieces of Brexit analysis produced since the UK’s vote to leave the European Union in June 2016.On yet another night dominated by television news shows speculating on what may happen next, and on the eve of yet another vote in the House of Commons, BBC Newsnight’s Nick Watt used the words of an anonymous British cabinet minister to sum up where Britain is at right now.“Now in cabinet I am picking up complete and utter despair,” he told viewers on Thursday night. “I said to one cabinet minister ‘why is the prime minister holding a vote?’ when she’s pretty sure that she’s going to lose.“And using very strong language, this cabinet minister said to me: ‘f**k knows, I’m past caring, it’s like the living dead in here”.At which point Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis can be heard in the background saying “Oh, God” with a distinct weariness. The British nation, and no doubt many of the hundreds of thousands of Newsnight viewers in Ireland and around the world sighed in agreement.Making the point that British politics is in disarray and that our nearest neighbour is in the throws of a most serious constitutional crisis, Watt continued: “This cabinet minister then went on to say ‘Theresa May is the sole architect’ of this mess. It is her inability to engage in the most basic human interactions that brought us here. Cabinet has totally broken down - ministers say their bit, she gives nothing away. One side thinks X will happen, the other side thinks Y will happen and the prime minster decides on Z”.And as if this wasn’t enough humiliation for one 24-hour period, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon, addressing May’s Brexit predicament, told the Scottish parliament yesterday: “It’s traditional for leaders to say to colleagues ‘you know if you don’t back me on an issue of such importance I might have to resign’. Not in the Tories though - Theresa May’s position is: if you don’t back me, I’ll stay”.“Theresa May must be the only leader in living memory who has tried to fall on her own sword and has managed to miss.”May attempted for a third time to get support for her Brexit withdrawal deal in the House of Commons on Friday but it was rejected by a margin of 58 votes.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

But are we really going to help pay for these human rights violations?Are we really going to help fund the murder of innocent citizens? I\u0027ve learned over years of dealing with murderous regimes that you can\u0027t shame them. But you can shame the banks, the financiers and the institutions that do business with them and choose to look the other way.Human rights lawyer Amal Clooney is married to and George Clooney admitted he had stayed at some of the hotels recently, saying he was unaware of their ownership.It is not the first time Hollywood has attempted to boycott the hotels for Brunei\u0027s treatment of the LGBT community.In 2014, when the country announced it was implementing Shariah Law, activists demanded stars stop attending Brunei-owned hotels and Clooney said a fundraising event usually held at the Beverly Hills Hotel was cancelled.However, Clooney said the boycott lost steam. Like all good intentions when the white heat of outrage moves on to the hundred other reasons to be outraged, the focus is down and slowly these hotels get back to the business of business, he said.Britain updated their travel advisories to caution people about the changes in the Muslim-majority country where Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has a firm grip on power.“No one should face the death penalty because of who they love,” Penny Mordaunt, Secretary of State for DFID, tweeted. “Brunei’s decision is barbaric and the UK stands with the LGBT+ community and those who defend their rights. LGBT+ rights are human rights.”Please review our commenting policyThe inside story of how Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal was defeated for a third time by MPs on a dramatic dayComment: The Tories are the party of nation.

Amused locals never quite understood where they came from. The enigma, however, has now been solved.Locals and environmentalists in Finistere had always suspected that the stray phones came from a lost underwater container. That suspicion was recently confirmed by a resident, who revealed he had come across it after a storm in the 1980s.The container was most likely lost by a ship during that storm. It then drifted against the coast of Brittany and, with the help of the low tide, got stuck in a fissure.The cats eventually found their way out of the damaged case, and lazily made it ashore.Bright orange pieces were found regularly by the local beach cleaning group Ar Viltansou.Our association has existed for 18 years and in that time we have found pieces of Garfield telephones almost each time we clean, said Claire Simonin, the group’s leader, to AFP.A shipping container which washed up during a storm in the 1980s, was found in a hidden sea caveAfter learning about the container’s location, Ms. Simonin and her crew went on an expedition to find it. We found this incredible fissure that is 30 metres deep and at the very bottom, there were the remains of a container, she said. Under the boulders in front of the entrance, we found 23 complete handsets with electronics and wires. They were everywhere.This story, however, is far from over.Fabien Boileau, director of the Irosie Marine Nature Park, was puzzled. We have no idea what happened at the time: we do not know where it came from, what boat, he told AFP, and we don\u0027t know if several containers fell into the water, or only one.Garfield the cat was brought to life by American cartoonist Jim Daves in 1978.

Such notions of a halfway house that allows the UK to have the best of all worlds have been rejected by the EU. As such, it is difficult to predict with any great certainty what any future UK trade policy will look like.Much of the Department of International Trade’s focus and capacity to date has been consumed by its colossal task: not only has it had to re-establish the UK as an independent actor at the WTO, create its own trade remedies regime and authority, and accede to the WTO government procurement agreement. It also is tasked with replacing the 40 trade agreements the UK is already party to by virtue of its EU membership.While continuity agreements have been agreed with a small number of countries, including Switzerland, Israel and Chile, there is still much to be done. Larger economies, such as Japan and Canada, have already indicated that they will treat the replication as a fresh negotiation, and for others, such as Turkey, the question as to whether the UK can fully replicate what already exists is entirely dependent on the nature of the future UK-EU relationship.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThis replication process will remain the UK’s overriding trade priority well into the transition period and, perhaps, beyond.\u0026nbspDuring that transition, if it has one, the UK can also begin negotiations with potential new free trade agreement partners. It has already identified New Zealand, Australia, the US and accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Transpacific Partnership (CPTPP—a plurilateral trade agreement made up of 11 countries) as a priority.While Australia and New Zealand will be happy to begin negotiations—knowing that it will buy political goodwill with the UK—nothing will be concluded until there is certainty over the UK’s future relationship with the EU, particularly whether the UK will be in a customs union with the EU and, if so, for how long.Negotiations with the US will prove trickier. Washington is unlikely to play the role of a disinterested observer, and a comprehensive trade deal with the US requires the UK not only gain control of its tariffs, but also fully extricate itself from the EU’s regulatory orbit in areas such as food hygiene. While the US is also pressuring the EU to budge on the chlorinated chicken\u0026nbspissue, it is unlikely to succeed.This leaves the UK in the awkward position of having to choose between prioritising frictionless trade in products of animal origin with its most important trading partner (with implications for Northern Ireland) or reduced friction with the US. However, if and when the UK decides to accept additional friction between the UK and the EU, or it becomes unavoidable due to UK and EU red lines, Britain may decide that the additional marginal cost of further ergence from the EU in order to accommodate American demands is a price worth paying.CPTPP will remain a long-term ambition. Putting aside jokes about whether the Pitcairn Islands qualify the UK as a Pacific power, the accession process is still unclear, and there are other more viable accession candidates such as Thailand and South Korea. Furthermore, there are differences in opinion between the UK and some existing members as to how much leeway the UK would have to negotiate opt-outs. Failure to accede to CPTPP in the short term is not in and of itself an issue for the UK.The gains of CPTPP are predominantly political—the UK will be replicating EU agreements or negotiating new ones with the main economic players of CPTPP anyway—in that attempted accession is designed to signal the UK’s continued commitment to the international rules-based order, something which has been placed in doubt by Brexit, and even merely placing ourselves in a queue partially achieves this.Ultimately, the question of what role the UK will play in the global trading system cannot be fully settled until the UK clarifies the depth and scope of future relationship with the EU. And until and unless it does, Britain’s future trade policy will remain disjointed, and its global role ill-defined.Sam Lowe is a\u0026nbspsenior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform.

It’s certainly not going to make a hit song for a band like REM, as Herbert’s quote once did. But it says much the same thing.\u0026nbspHuawei products have \u0027significant\u0027 flaws that could risk UK securityHuawei unveils smartglasses indistinguishable from regular glassesHuawei P30 Pro leaked video reveals nearly everything except the priceThe timing was coincidental, but you could almost see it as a riposte to the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which a day earlier had said it had found further “significant technical issues in Huawei’s engineering processes leading to new risks” to UK telecommunications networks.\u0026nbspMost of the worries about Huawei have centred on whether or not its equipment is susceptible to hacking by the Chinese government. They’ve formed the centrepiece of the US led campaign against it.The report, however, says the NCSC “does not believe that the defects identified are a result of Chinese state interference”.\u0026nbspInstead its concerns centre on “basic engineering competence and cyber security hygiene that give rise to vulnerabilities that are capable of being exploited by a range of actors”.\u0026nbspIt also takes aim at the action, or lack of it, taken to address them. Ouch.Crucially, however, it doesn’t recommend a ban on\u0026nbspHuawei’s involvement in UK 5G, despite US pressure and the moves that have been taken against the business by other Western nations such as Australia.\u0026nbspHuawei has a significant presence in the UK. Guo Ping, its rotating chairman, made much in his statement about its commitment to “complying with relevant standards” and building “trustworthy and high-quality products”.\u0026nbspHe also noted archly that “countries that choose to work with Huawei will gain an advantage for the next wave of growth in the digital economy”. Could it be that an isolated UK facing a post Brexit chill might could end up needing Huawei more than Huawei needs the UK?\u0026nbspAmerica’s efforts to stymie the company, meanwhile, don’t yet appear to have had a signifiant impact on its bottom line. It is notable that sales of telecom equipment to carriers (think Vodafone etc) slipped by 1.3 per cent. The company, however, brushed this off as down to investment cycles in the global telecom industry. And a significant chunk of the world remains relaxed about doing business with it.\u0026nbspThen there’s the consumer electronics unit. Huawei sold more than 200m of its highly rated smartphones, driving a 45 per cent rise in revenues at that part of the company.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Instead, we are now in this state of short-term limbo, leaving many buyers and sellers unsure what to do.“Normally, we would expect to see a spike in transaction levels around this time as we enter the traditional spring bounce period, but with the extension to the EU leaving date, the bounce is likely to be a little subdued this year.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The service is\u0026nbsppart of £108m of additional freight that is supposed to prevent chaos at Britain’s ports and secure\u0026nbspthe supply of vital goods such as medicines and\u0026nbsporgans for transplants.The government has no use for the space for at least another two weeks because Brexit has been delayed. But Brittany Ferries said it was too late to cancel the 20 extra crossings it will be running each week so space is being sold on the open market.Brittany Ferries altered the travel plans of more than 20,000 passengers with existing bookings when it changed its schedules in January.As part of its contingency planning the Department for Transport also awarded a £14m contract to Seaborne Freight and a £43m contract to Danish shipping firm DFDS. The department terminated its agreement with Seaborne when it became clear that it could not provide the service required. The company had no ships and no financial track record.The government also had to shell out an additional £33m to settle legal action brought by Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel over the DfT’s “secretive and flawed” procurement process. A further £800,000 was spent on consultants who assessed the deals.Brittany said it had incurred extra costs stemming from the contract, including more fuel and higher port fees.“Fifty additional Brittany Ferries’ port staff have been hired on both sides of the Channel to deal with more frequent port calls,” a spokesperson said.\u0026nbsp“We have also spent the last three months training current onboard teams.“The reality is that we were committed as soon as we signed the contract and preparations began to deliver the dedicated NHS shipment channel. There is no turning back at this late stage because all the preparatory work is now in place for 29 March.”Ramsgate in Kent where Seaborne Freight was to have run its no-deal Brexit ferry service from (AFPGetty)Brittany said it was using its “best endeavours” to re-sell unused capacity\u0026nbspto reduce costs to the taxpayer.\u0026nbspA government spokeswoman said it was “only right that we push on with contingency measures”.She added: “The government’s freight capacity contracts run for six months and are a vital part of wider contingency planning. They provide capacity for critical goods, including vital medicines, to continue to enter the UK in a no-deal scenario.“Due to the agreed extension until 12 April, tickets for the first two weeks have been released for sale on the open market, which will minimise costs for the taxpayer.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

They were described as showing a New iPhone XR – but if that is correct, it likely refers to the phone that will take the XR\u0027s place as the cheaper and mid-sized part of next year\u0027s line-up.However, the phone of this design is actually thought to be the iPhone 11, or whatever\u0026nbspthe follow-up to the current iPhone XS is named. The new version of the XR is expected to have just two cameras in its back – an extra one compared to its predecessor, and the same number as the more premium phones in the line-up.Apple apologises to MacBook owners about broken keyboardsIt is still not clear what Apple will do with the wide variety of cameras in the iPhone 11: rumours have suggested that the extra one could be used for augmented reality features, or for improving the phone\u0027s performance in situations that would be otherwise difficult to photograph. The two lenses in the XS – and presumably in the new version of the XR – have one wide angle and another more zoomed in lens.All of the phones are expected to arrive in September, when Apple traditionally releases its new handsets.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She didn’t really buy into it herself, although she did like the flowers. She wouldn’t eat the proffered chocolates – she was on a perpetual diet – but she appreciated the gesture. She was a complicated woman, my mother, and 20 years after her death I tried to find out what was at the root of that complication, and why her relationship with her own mother, my cherished grandmother, had been such a fractious one. Every Mother’s Day since her death, I remember her, and remember, too, just how much I continue to miss her.A few years ago, I passed the night with friends around a Ouija board. Wine had been drunk beforehand. We spent several bewildering hours suspending disbelief while the planchette swung with gusto around the board’s alphabet, assiduously spelling out messages for us. It seemed that we could request an audience with some of our dearly departed just as efficiently as if we had called them on the phone, and each in turn appeared only too eager to communicate with us, one letter at a time.We spoke with a dead aunt, a dead grandparent, and their responses were loquacious, melancholic, optimistic and even funny. None of us had any idea what was happening, or how, but it was riveting. After some time, it was my turn. I called up my late mother and, lo, my mother ‘’arrived’’, if that’s the word I’m looking for here. Following my friends’ lead, I asked if there was anything she wanted to tell me, and I braced myself for her answer, tingling with anticipation at what she might wish to convey to me from beyond the grave. ‘N’ was the first letter the planchette alighted on. ‘O’ was the second.\u0026nbsp“No.”But I was not put off. There was still so much about my mother, and her relationship with her own mother, that I wanted to learn about, questions for which I now belatedly craved answers. And so I made contact with Loretta, an old friend of my mother’s in Italy, and asked if we could meet. I told her why. She went quiet on the phone before agreeing. “Of course,” she said. “See you soon.”One year after losing her mom this woman is celebrating Mother’s DayI have known Loretta for most of my life, and have always liked her. She was cool and chic and slightly aloof, as if designed by Yves Saint Laurent and dressed by Chanel. She was softly spoken and, helpfully for me, spoke perfect English.\u0026nbspIn the living room of her small central Milan flat a few months later, I took out my dictaphone to record our conversation, but while in one sense it felt just like any other interview for me, the answers she gave me made it unlike any I had ever previously conducted.\u0026nbspIt was at some point during the Second World War, she told me, that my grandmother arrived in Italy from her native Yugoslavia. She was with her boyfriend, a nameless Russian. They had been in a relationship for at least a year, and were happy. I wanted more details, but all she could tell me was that, together, they fled to Milan. When she learnt that she was pregnant, my grandmother, an observant Catholic, suggested they get married quickly. He wasn’t interested in marriage, so she abruptly broke off their relationship, and never saw him again.This single mother then subsequently found sanctuary in a convent, and, at some point later – the details hazy – she met the man who would become my grandfather, an Italian. While he was happy with this ready-made family situation, his own mother (with whom he lived) was less obliging, and would only accept my grandmother if they gave up the child.“So she did,” Loretta told me. “She sent her to the convent.”My mother was five. I asked Loretta how long she remained there, but she didn’t know. “Several years, I think. And your mother, she never forgot this, and never forgave her.”Duerden)My grandfather’s domineering mother eventually relented, and allowed my mother, now almost 10, under her roof. But, Loretta explained, “she was not happy at home. There was tension.”My mother and Loretta became friends at school, by which time all my mother wanted to do, in Loretta’s words, was to\u0026nbsp“go to England, leave her family, and not come back”. And so in 1963, she went to London, where she worked as a nanny and then a secretary, and lived in Finchley, and later on the Earls Court Road. Six months later, Loretta joined her. It was an exciting time to be in the city. London was\u0026nbspswinging. The Beatles were happening. These two young friends were now sharing a flat with several other Italian women. They were free, and single, and had disposable incomes.I asked Loretta what life was like for my mother, at last far from the constraints of her overbearing parents. Did she savour her freedom, enjoy herself? “I don’t know. Your mother was always so… so serious. She was reflective depressive, I would say. She was always trying to be perfect, and never to do anything wrong. She over-thought a lot, and I don’t think she was an easy person. We were a group of girls, a group of young Italians, but the only one who could really get on with her was me.”I was inexpressibly sad to hear this, and felt a lump rising in my throat.\u0026nbsp“She was, I don’t know… too straight, perhaps. She didn’t allow herself to have fun. And she didn’t do the things that maybe one would do when you are free in London at that age. I felt that she always had on her shoulders some kind of responsibility, to do right, to be good.” A shake of the head. “I don’t know.”Created with Sketch. Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.By 1968, Loretta back in Italy,\u0026nbspmy mother met a Yorkshireman who had relocated to the capital to work, initially\u0026nbspin the hotel business. Their romance progressed quickly. My mother telephoned home to say that she was getting married. “They were not happy with this,” Loretta told me. “They flew to London to convince her to come back with them. They couldn’t accept that their girl was going to live so far away. But she didn’t care, she just sent them home.”Following my birth, we moved into a tower block in Peckham, south London, where we would be frequently burgled and where, on occasion, distraught people would take our lift up to the 19th floor, 10 floors above us, and throw themselves off the roof. There were perhaps better places to grow up. My father, by now working in the travel industry, was away a lot, and my grandparents worried for my mother. They didn’t like where we were living, how we were living. They didn’t like him. “The marriage won’t last,” they taunted. “It will end in tears.” When it eventually did, a decade later, they insisted once again that she return to Milan. And once again, she resisted.London suited her back in the late\u0026nbsp1970s\u0026nbspand early\u0026nbsp1980s\u0026nbsp– and her idiosyncrasies. She was likely the only yoga enthusiast in\u0026nbspPeckham\u0026nbspand probably the only vegetarian, too“Your mother was very strong but very stubborn, just like your grandmother, in fact,” Loretta said. “Both women always said what they felt. I know that your grandmother felt guilty for putting her in the convent that time, but she had apologised, she wanted to move on, to forget. But your mother, she never could.”Loretta fell silent now, and I was amazed by the drama of it all, so much of which I’d never known. I had known she’d felt the instinctive pull back to Italy, and also that she resisted it. London suited her, and what were viewed – back in the late 1970s and early 1980s – her idiosyncrasies. She was likely the only yoga enthusiast in Peckham back then, and probably the only vegetarian, too. She was extolling the virtues of acidophilus and Echinacea to me a good three decades before I came to see their benefits for myself. But she was hampered by depression and unhappiness. There were secretive bouts of anorexia and bulimia. She was lonely and unfulfilled, forever searching for something that would ultimately elude her. She was angry a lot, rarely at me, always at herself and her inability to break her often self-destructive cycles. When she became ill with pancreatic cancer at the beginning of 1999, the doctors gave her six months. She lasted 11. Her reaction to it was, to me, slightly deranged. Pancreatic cancer is painful. There is no scale of 1 to 10, because it’s more, always more. At first she took painkillers, but increasingly elected not to. Instead, she appeared to accept it, believing that she had developed the illness because of stress brought on by longterm discontent. She felt she had failed at life, and that this was her ultimate punishment. She would endure it because she deserved it – fate, kismet, karma.I kept telling her that she should go, that if your grandfather didn’t want to go with her, he would be fine at home alone – and even if not, then to hell with him!\u0026nbspI watched as the cancer did its highly efficient work and transformed her from a woman who, late in life, had found some purpose and contentment – she had left her office job to focus entirely on her pursuit in Tai Chi, and the meditative calm it offered – to someone who had been all but worn away by pain, and driven half mad because of it. I pleaded with her relentlessly: take the morphine, toss the St John’s wort away, allow the doctors to help. But every week I watched her deplete. There was cruelty in this.Throughout her illness, my grandparents chose not to visit. I don’t remember questioning their decision so much as blindly accepting it. They hadn’t come to London for many years anyway, and always hated travelling too far from home. My grandfather had his routines, and my grandmother had for so long played the loyal wife that this role trumped the secondary maternal one.My grandmother ultimately did visit, bullied into it – and accompanied – by Loretta. “I kept telling her that she should go, that if your grandfather didn’t want to go with her, he would be fine at home alone – and even if not, then to hell with him! Her daughter was ill! She needed to be with her.”They came for just two days in October, heading straight to the hospice where they found her curled up skeletal on a bed that had, over the previous weeks, become far too big for her. I had been encouraged by the prospect of their arrival, a mother and daughter reunion, but my mother’s response was hers alone, and nothing if not consistent. She didn’t want to talk. There was no mellowing at this late, final stage. I waited outside in the corridor, leaving them to it.10 best Mother’s Day gifts to treat the queen in your life10 best Mother’s Day gardening gifts for your green-fingered matriarch15 best personalised Mother’s Day gifts to show her you really care“They fought,” Loretta told me now. “Your grandmother was crying nearly all the night afterwards, but she wouldn’t tell me why, what their fight had been about. She wouldn’t tell me anything.”It seems that this is not in any way untypical of families with their buried secrets and festering resentments. We’ve all got them, and not all wounds heal. I had always been aware that there had been some lingering poison there, but never the extent of it, never the full reasons why. My grandmother had behaved the way she had behaved, and for what I can only presume was good reason. It is a shame that my mother couldn’t accept this, and over time learn to sympathise and empathise. She could have chosen to forgive her, to see things from her perspective: a beleaguered single mother in a devoutly Catholic country where codes of conduct were being forcefully reasserted after the years of chaos that come with war. But she didn’t.My mother died a month after their visit, on 27 November, the occasion of my grandmother’s 81st birthday. They didn’t fly over for the funeral. Every year thereafter, when I called her to wish her a happy birthday, she said my mother’s name to me, voicing it aloud for no other reason than she had to, a maternal compulsion, and then burst once again into copious tears that extinguished any semblance of celebration, and rendered all further conversation irrelevant.What else was there to say?The Smallest Things: On the Enduring Power of Family by Nick Duerden is published by Elliott \u0026amp Thompson.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Four hours after PMQs, May promised Conservative MPs she would stand down if the Commons approved her Brexit deal.It was enough to persuade several Eurosceptics to back her agreement. For a few hours, there was real hope in Downing Street that a majority was finally in sight.Then normal service resumed. The Democratic Unionist Party restated its opposition, halting the Tory momentum towards backing the deal. May’s gamble had failed. A joke did the rounds in parliament: May was so useless, she couldn’t even resign properly.

It has been punctuated by mistakes. She did not want to be “the Brexit prime minister”, and longed to pursue a domestic agenda.\u0026nbspShe judged, rightly, that the 2016 referendum result was not really a vote against the EU, but a cry from the “left-behind”.Her speech in Downing Street on becoming prime minister, pledging to help the “just about managing” and to root out “burning injustice”, was pitch perfect. But she never lived it up to it. True, there were initiatives – some welcome, such as a race disparity audit. But any prospect of a coherent, meaty agenda was eclipsed long ago by Brexit, which, in Whitehall speak, left little “bandwidth” in the government machine for much else.May never really recovered from her early Brexit errors. As a reluctant Remainer, she was desperate to reassure Brexiteers she would deliver on the referendum result. The pivotal moment was the Tory conference in October 2016.In a speech drafted by her close aide Nick Timothy – which, crucially, bypassed the Whitehall machine – May set the red lines which would dominate the Brexit negotiations. The UK would leave the customs union, end the free movement of people (which would mean leaving single market) and end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Senior civil servants were appalled some believed May did not understand how she was closing off her options.One of the bitter ironies of the Brexit saga is that only now, with parliament trying to seize the reins, is there a proper and long overdue debate about the merits of the customs union and the single market. \u0026nbspThe one thing I underestimated when I went into No 10 was the extent to which the prime minister is steeped in the DNA of the Conservative PartyIn her conference speech May, under intense pressure from Tory Eurosceptics to get a move on, promised to trigger the two-year Article 50\u0026nbspexit process by March 2017. Some allies now concede this was premature, as she did not have a clear vision of what she wanted.Her rigid red lines might have worked if she had sought a limited, Canada-style free trade agreement, which the EU would have accepted. But, with Whitehall and business warning about the economic cost of ending frictionless trade and a slender majority of 12 in a Commons with Remainers in the ascendancy, May would struggle to secure UK approval for such a deal. The answer, May was told by cabinet ministers Philip Hammond and David Davis, was to call a general election and secure a big majority.Although she had originally ruled one out, she was persuaded to U-turn, with opinion polls raising her allies’ hopes she could win a majority of 80. It was her second fatal mistake. She wanted a “Brexit election” but Jeremy Corbyn had other ideas, exposing May’s Achilles heel on domestic policy by focusing on austerity.May’s loss of her overall majority meant that today’s power struggle between the government and the Commons was only a matter of time. Yet she remained in denial about the parliamentary arithmetic. She could have changed course towards the soft Brexit majority among MPs, but rejected overtures for her to reach across the aisle, and reach out to the 48 per cent she had neglected since the referendum.Despite warning of the hard choices ahead, May consistently put them off in an attempt to ensure her own survival and preserve Tory unity.She defied her critics by getting the EU negotiations over the line at crucial stages, but without resolving the fundamental contradiction in her strategy. She pledged to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland\u0026nbspand, under pressure from the Democratic Unionist Party on whose Commons votes she depended, promised to avoid a different regulatory and tariff regime in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. But she also insisted the UK must be able to strike trade deals with non-EU countries. She has still not solved this puzzle and the DUP remains opposed to her withdrawal agreement.May tried to square the circle when she finally produced her Chequers blueprint. But she failed to win the frictionless trade she sought in the fraught negotiations with the EU.\u0026nbspShe and her ministers made a series of miscalculations. They approached the talks as if they were a traditional EU negotiation among 28 partners, not realising that it would be 27 versus one. They were convinced the UK could “ide and rule” but the EU maintained iron discipline and unity. May tried to woo her fellow leaders, but they deliberately left the European Commission in the driving seat. (It was revealing that the first cracks finally showed this month when the 27 leaders rather than the European Commission decided on an Article 50 extension.)The EU thus called the shots and fixed the timetable. May’s naive hopes that a long-term trade agreement would be sorted by exit day today were dashed. The EU insisted on first resolving the UK’s orce payment, citizens’ rights and a backstop to prevent a hard Irish border – with no talks on the future relationship until after the UK’s departure.Created with Sketch.Brexit billboards: Campaigners remind MPs of past promises Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nigel Farage has spent his political career campaigning for the UK to leave the EU.Boris Johnson\u0027s support for Brexit took many by surprise before the EU referendum.The UK and EU are yet to agree on a withdrawal deal.

Even when May’s diplomacy worked – she secured a UK-wide customs union instead of a Northern Ireland-only one – it antagonised the noisy Eurosceptics. The withdrawal agreement which emerged left them seething at “Brexit in name only”, while pro-Europeans saw it as much worse than EU membership, fuelling demands for a Final Say referendum.In another catastrophic error, May made a televised address in which she blamed the deadlock on parliament, insulting the very\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbsp– particularly on the Labour side – whose votes she so desperately neededMay’s prioritising of Tory unity failed to prevent 28 ministerial resignations (18 of them over Brexit) in less than three years, more than Thatcher suffered in 11. The departures did not ensure cabinet unity – far from it. Discipline has broken down. May has been pushed one way and then another by resignation threats from Brexiteer and pro-EU ministers.Her once-admired resilience is now seen as stubbornness by frustrated ministers, who long for her to give a lead at a time of national crisis. They leave cabinet meetings on Brexit with no idea of what will happen next because the inscrutable May keeps her cards nailed to her chest.After two crushing Commons defeats for her agreement in January and March, May had the humiliation of pleading with the EU to extend the UK’s membership beyond today’s original exit date. By now she knew her legacy would not only be as the “Brexit prime minister” but possibly as the one who failed even to deliver Brexit.The pressure was inevitably taking its toll. In another catastrophic error, May made a televised address to the nation in which she blamed the deadlock on parliament, insulting and offending the very MPs – particularly on the Labour side – whose votes she so desperately needed. In that moment, the die was probably cast.May thought she had one last roll, even though it meant giving up hope of forging a post-Brexit domestic agenda. In an attempt to hold her factious party together, she sacrificed her other central objective – her own survival – by promising to quit if her MPs gave her a majority for her deal.But with her focus on the Tories, she made yet another miscalculation: Labour MPs representing Leave areas, already furious at her attack on parliament for doing its job, now feared her departure would see a hardline Brexiteer succeed her, making them even less likely to carry her deal over the line.\u0026nbspDespite May’s efforts to woo them, only five Labour MPs backed her in today’s Commons vote.After a third defeat for her withdrawal agreement\u0026nbsp– albeit by a less margin – the game may be up.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But engineers now hope the flying helicopter will able to soar over it, allowing for a new perspective on the Martian surface.Remotely controlling a helicopter from hundreds of millions of miles away, on top of Mars\u0027s thin atmosphere and freezing temperatures as low as minus 90C (minus 130F) at night, make flying such a device an incredibly difficult technical feat.The space agency has been putting the 4lb (1.8kg) helicopter through its paces in a vacuum chamber at its Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which swaps nitrogen, oxygen and other gases for carbon dioxide to mimic the atmosphere of the Red Planet, as well as a gravity offload system.Getting our helicopter into an extremely thin atmosphere is only part of the challenge, said Teddy Tzanetos, test conductor for the Mars Helicopter.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nasa celebrated Black Friday by looking into space instead — sharing pictures of black holes230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

The service is\u0026nbsppart of £108m of additional freight that is supposed to prevent chaos at Britain’s ports and secure\u0026nbspthe supply of vital goods such as medicines and\u0026nbsporgans for transplants.The government has no use for the space for at least another two weeks because Brexit has been delayed. But Brittany Ferries said it was too late to cancel the 20 extra crossings it will be running each week so space is being sold on the open market.Brittany Ferries altered the travel plans of more than 20,000 passengers with existing bookings when it changed its schedules in January.As part of its contingency planning the Department for Transport also awarded a £14m contract to Seaborne Freight and a £43m contract to Danish shipping firm DFDS. The department terminated its agreement with Seaborne when it became clear that it could not provide the service required. The company had no ships and no financial track record.The government also had to shell out an additional £33m to settle legal action brought by Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel over the DfT’s “secretive and flawed” procurement process. A further £800,000 was spent on consultants who assessed the deals.Brittany said it had incurred extra costs stemming from the contract, including more fuel and higher port fees.“Fifty additional Brittany Ferries’ port staff have been hired on both sides of the Channel to deal with more frequent port calls,” a spokesperson said.\u0026nbsp“We have also spent the last three months training current onboard teams.“The reality is that we were committed as soon as we signed the contract and preparations began to deliver the dedicated NHS shipment channel. There is no turning back at this late stage because all the preparatory work is now in place for 29 March.”Ramsgate in Kent where Seaborne Freight was to have run its no-deal Brexit ferry service from (AFPGetty)Brittany said it was using its “best endeavours” to re-sell unused capacity\u0026nbspto reduce costs to the taxpayer.\u0026nbspA government spokeswoman said it was “only right that we push on with contingency measures”.She added: “The government’s freight capacity contracts run for six months and are a vital part of wider contingency planning. They provide capacity for critical goods, including vital medicines, to continue to enter the UK in a no-deal scenario.“Due to the agreed extension until 12 April, tickets for the first two weeks have been released for sale on the open market, which will minimise costs for the taxpayer.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The strange rules are said to be enforced by the company\u0027s 73-year-old owner, who is rumoured to enter the pubs undercover to check that they are being kept to.The phone rule enforces a wide-ranging ban on phones and tablets, as well as including particular bans on pictures of sport and music apps.The brewery\u0027s policy is not to allow customers to use mobile phones, laptops or similar inside our pubs, reads the memo, which was first reported by the Manchester Evening News.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

One manager said the rule was being loosely enforced for now, but that it might become stricter as time goes on.Staff working at other pubs said they were yet to hear about the rule.Calls to Samuel Smith\u0027s central office were unanswered.One pub manager said that while it can be detrimental to have people on the phone, any restriction\u0026nbspshould be informal and policed by the iniduals themselves rather than being a strict rule.It’s a intrinsic part of modern society and that may be an issue but it’s not one for Sam Smiths to solve, said Heather Griffin, who manages the Rutland Arms in Sheffield, which is not a Sam Smiths pub.\u0026nbspIf they’re as hard line about it as they are with swearing that unfair cause people need their phones in certain situations and having it makes people feel more comfortable.I just think it comes across as quite pretentious – like they think they are somehow better than people who enjoy to use their phones for whatever use they want.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s just a shame to see it relegated to such a tiny corner of the cultural conversation.Peele’s riff on The Twilight Zone\u0026nbspis mesmerising and unforgettable. Just as Serling brought voices he liked to the program, Jordan Peele collaborates with talents like Ana Lily Amirpour, Glen Morgan, and a great ensemble of actors to produce a show that’s so good you’ll want to get that subscription to CBS All Access.\u0026nbspPeele makes an unnerving host, simultaneously channeling Serling and creating something new. He’s carefully adjusted his speech to mirror Serling’s famous cadence, but when he stares straight into the camera, there’s a cruel blankness in his eyes. The actor’s physical stillness only makes you feel more uneasy. Peele comes across as less of a narrator, and more like a bored god, playing with people as though they were toys.Even amid recent sci-fi anthologies like Black Mirror and Electric Dreams, the Twilight Zone brand remains strong. These introductory episodes are unmistakably Twilight Zone stories, built on simple, character-driven ideas with minimal world-building. They’re still speculative fiction, but they’re more along the lines of Groundhog Day or It’s A Wonderful Life –\u0026nbspstories that many viewers wouldn’t automatically identify as sci-fi or fantasy.The Twilight Zone\u0026nbspisn’t a filtered down version of the original, nor of its narrator’s own work. Peele’s stamp is all over it, but so are the many welcome imprints of various writers, directors, and stars. It’s an inclusive space as much as a creative one, making the 2019 Twilight Zone\u0026nbspa new machine built to last.Rebooting The Twilight Zone doesn’t only mean relating to and understanding its original thesis. It takes a voice like Peele’s, one acutely aware of what that metaphorical dimension would look like in today’s era and how it would, for instance, exact justice on the morally bankrupt.The new Zone looks at paranoia, class disparity, artistic anxiety, xenophobia, racism, and other hot-button topics from the perspective of an outsider who had to fight for his piece of American pie, in contrast to the more abstract, theoretical diagnoses and warnings of Serling, who was as woke as a rich white guy could be in the middle of the 20th century but was nevertheless incapable of taking a ground-level view of the problems his series identified, even in the imaginative safe space of The Twilight Zone.The Twilight Zone premieres on CBS All Access on 1 April.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This also therefore\u0026nbsptheoretically allows users to save battery power.Automatic Dark Mode allows iOS users to switch from light to dark mode themes according to their time zone.To activate the standard dark mode on Twitter\u0027s website, users need to click on their profile picture in the top right of the website and select Night Mode.Created with Sketch.11 useful Twitter features you might not know about Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Turn on Night ModeTwitter’s dark blue Night Mode is a lot easier on your eyes than its regular, vibrant theme.

That’s what Banksy does.“He points a mirror back at society, so this is exciting for us, it’s exciting for the museum and it’s really exciting for Bristol.”Exhibition curator Philip Walker said: “When this work was shown 10 years ago it caused a real stir and was one of the highlights of the Banksy vs Bristol Museum exhibition.“It feels like a timely chance to revisit the work and a great opportunity to share Banksy’s largest known work on canvas with the public again.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Absolutely. No question.”Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentThere had been speculation that the vote itself was set up for 29 March to make a show of Mr Corbyn’s party voting against Brexit ahead of a pending election campaign.One cabinet minister later said: “We would throw at them the question of ‘what did your MP do on exit day?’We would throw at them the question of ‘what did your MP do on exit day?’. This is going to be difficult for a lot of inidual Labour\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspin Leave areas“This is going to be difficult for a lot of inidual Labour MPs in Leave areas.”Speaking from the despatch box, the prime minister said “it should be a matter of profound regret” for every MP that the Commons had once again failed to approve Brexit.In a hint that was widely interpreted as a tilt towards the ballot box, she said: “I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this house.“This house has rejected no deal. It has rejected no Brexit. On Wednesday it rejected all the variations of the deal on the table. And today it has rejected approving the withdrawal agreement alone and continuing a process on the future.MPs reject her Brexit agreement by 58 votes“This government will continue to press the case for the orderly Brexit that the result of the referendum demands.”Her aides later repeatedly failed to explicitly deny that the prime minister had meant that she was now seriously considering an election.Leavers and Remainers united by Brexit Day bluesTories delay social care reform for sixth time amid Brexit gridlockEmily Maitlis eviscerates Jacob Rees-Mogg for ‘evoking slavery’Hitting back, Mr Corbyn argued that the Commons had given Ms May a clear message that her deal in its current form is unacceptable and it should be radically altered.The Labour leader said: “If the prime minister can’t accept that then she must go – not at an indeterminate date in the future but now, so that we can decide the future of this country through a general election.”The SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford also called for Brexit to be put back to the people, saying: “I think there has to be a general election.”Downing Street insiders said that while it was obviously disappointing the government had not won the vote on Friday, there was a clear movement towards the prime minister’s position.Yanis Varoufakis perfectly sums up Theresa May’s handling of BrexitIn a key moment, ex-Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, seen as a strong future leadership contender from the Eurosceptic wing of the Tories, said he would now back the deal.At least eight Labour MPs indicated publicly that they might back the deal if Ms May was prepared to give greater guarantees on workers’ rights and parliament’s ability to shape the future relations – something she pledged to do in the aftermath of the result.On Monday MPs will again have the chance to vote on a range of Brexit alternatives after a previous process indicated a future arrangement relating to a customs union could carry a majority.If MPs back one, Downing Street\u0026nbspaides have said the Commons could be faced with a run-off between opting for Ms May’s deal or a customs union.But the prime minister has strongly indicated that she could not countenance asking the EU for such an arrangement and could in that instance demand an election.Equally, if MPs could find no other compromise but still refused her deal, then an election would become an equally likely prospect to break the Brexit impasse.We’ll tell you what’s true.

That has not happened.According to the Council\u0027s ruling, the UK now has until 12 April to put forward an alternative plan or\u0026nbspleave the bloc without a deal on that day.MPs are almost certain to block a no-deal exit, so the most likely alternative is\u0026nbspthe government having to request a long delay to Brexit to allow\u0026nbspparliament to work out what kind of deal it might support.\u0026nbspSpeaking immediately after her latest defeat, Ms May told MPs: The implications of the House’s decision are grave. The legal default now is that the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on 12 April - in just 14 days’ time.This is not enough time to agree, legislate for and ratify a deal, and yet the House has been clear it will not permit leaving without a deal. And so we will have to agree an alternative way forward.The European Union has been clear that any further extension will need to have a clear purpose and will need to be agreed unanimously by the heads of the other 27 member states ahead of 12 April. It is also almost certain to involve the UK being required to hold European Parliamentary elections.What does it mean for Theresa May\u0027s premiership?That is unclear. On the one hand, the prime minister has pledged to resign if her deal is approved by MPs. That has not happened, making\u0026nbspit more likely that she will stay in post.That prompted speculation that the prime minister would resign if she is asked to request a long extension to Article 50.\u0026nbspShe did not\u0026nbspconfirm this definitively, however, and so\u0026nbspher deal being rejected again\u0026nbspmakes it more likely that she will stay on - at least for now.Will there be yet another vote on Ms May\u0027s Brexit deal?Don\u0027t rule it out.Ms May is determined to secure parliament\u0027s approval for the deal she has spent most of the last two years negotiating. She told MPs\u0026nbspon Friday that her government would continue to press the case for the orderly Brexit that the result of the referendum demands.Government officials suggested the prime minister is likely to try to hold a fourth vote on her deal next week.However, she will need to find a way around the\u0026nbspruling by John Bercow, the Commons speaker, that there cannot be another vote on the deal unless it has changed substantially.

That is likely to present Tory Eurosceptics with a stark choice: either back Ms May\u0027s deal or face the prospect of\u0026nbspa much softer Brexit or a fresh referendum that could result in no Brexit at all.Is a general election now on the cards?Some MPs believe\u0026nbspa general election is now the only way to break the deadlock gripping parliament.It would also be difficult for the current\u0026nbspgovernment to agree to seek a softer Brexit involving, for example, a customs union with the EU, given Theresa May\u0026nbspand her ministers have repeatedly ruled this out.\u0026nbspMPs reject her Brexit agreement by 58 votesThe prime minister appeared to hint at the possibility of a general\u0026nbspelection immediately after the vote, telling MPs: I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House.This House has rejected no deal. It has rejected no Brexit. On Wednesday it rejected all the variations of the deal on the table.

But, as the UK’s 73 representatives prepared to pack up boxes, offices and flats, there was one question hanging over their “final” European parliament session in the French city: was it really their last visit after all?With chaos still reigning in Westminster, MEPs could find themselves in Strasbourg – where the European parliament sits once a month – again in April. Or, with a lengthier extension, they could even be fighting for re-election come May. As with most things Brexit, even at this late stage, the future remains unclear.“I need a sign around my neck that says, ‘I don’t know either’,” says Catherine Bearder, the Lib Dems’ only MEP, standing in her bare office filled with cardboard boxes. A staffer adds: “We’ve had a lot of trolls on Twitter asking us, ‘Have you packed your bags yet?’” The answer is now obvious.Until this morning, Bearder’s office had been packed with mementos from almost a decade as an MEP, where she has been active in campaigning against the ivory trade. “You’ve missed the elephants – they’re now all packed in that box there,” she says, pointing to crates filled with models given to her by grateful constituents and campaigners.Although sometimes derided as a rubber-stamp for Brussels, the European parliament gained more power in the 2007 Lisbon treaty and is developing a will of its own. MEPs scrutinise and amend legislation and its growing assertiveness has seen it change laws and block plans on everything from agricultural subsidies to copyright regulation. Last year MEPs even triggered a sanctions procedure against a member state for the first time – Hungary – over violations of the rule of law, pre-empting the European Commission and EU leaders themselves.Parliament isn’t perfect – in Brussels or WestminsterRoughly once a month a caravan of officials trek\u0026nbspfrom Brussels to the alternative base – which is mandated by a historical quirk of the EU’s treaties – using French TGV trains chartered by the parliament’s authorities. If Theresa May’s deal gets through parliament, moving the Brexit day from 12 April to 22 May, British MEPs will make the trip one more time to spend a week perched among their boxes. A delayed exit would mean taking part in European elections, and a longer stay of execution.All this leaves Britain’s representatives and their staff, who are mostly young graduates, with no idea how much longer they have a job for – and where their next pay cheque is coming from. Bearder says: “I feel as if somebody’s got my brain on a piece of elastic. One minute you’re here, one minute you’re there. It is stressful because you can’t plan, you don’t know what’s coming next.”You have to encourage them to go because you know it’s a job with no futureBut despite looming oblivion, work has not stopped for British MEPs and their staff in Strasbourg: there are still votes to be held on issues including controversial copyright directive, the rights of ethnic minorities, and labelling of car tyres. Staffers are getting on with it, but they’re frustrated as they try to plan their lives for the next few months in the shadow of Brexit.“So many of my friends have given notice on their tenancies in Brussels,” one assistant who works for a British MEP tells The Independent.“Now there’s an extension and possibly another one around the corner, they still have a job here… people are talking about living in Airbnbs as a holdover until they know exactly what’s going to happen.”MEPs are packing up their bags but will they be back? (EPA)But others aren’t sticking around to wait and see. A press officer who works for one of the UK delegations says he’s had enough and has already got a job lined up working for the civil service in London – where there’s understandable demand for those who have knowledge of\u0026nbspthe EU and Brexit.“It’s about timing,” says the press officer. “I’ve been lucky to land a decent job now and I don’t know if I’ll be able to find anything as good at the end of the year. Especially if it ends up being no deal and we end up in a recession.”Created with Sketch.What\u0027s the European Parliament ever done for us?

The report estimates  the costs to British business and the health service add up to £20 billion every yearThe UK government, which is preoccupied with other matters, has done nothing for the hundreds of UK staff facing redundancy. This is perhaps unsurprising: campaign groups representing British citizens living in the EU have long complained of being completely ignored by senior ministers, who they believe see them as their host countries’ problem. In the two years since the Brexit process began, successive Brexit secretaries have all refused to meet with UK citizen groups – who, despite a popular image as Costa del Sol pensioners, are actually overwhelmingly working age\u0026nbspwith jobs to keep on top of. Over the same time, EU figures such as chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit chief, have provided regular meetings and consultations with the same groups.Most MEPs tell The Independent they are angry at the way their staff have been treated. Molly Scott Cato, a Green Party politician\u0026nbspwho represents South West England, makes clear that MEPs – who have chosen to go into politics – are “fair game” for uncertainty, but office staff are another matter.“A lot of MEPs are working without any staff at all. Half of mine have gone you have to encourage them to go because you know it’s a job with no future, but to not give them any information at all when they’re basically public servants of the United Kingdom I think is disgraceful.”She adds: “If it was to say\u0026nbspHonda\u0026nbspwas shutting down, they’d organise training and advice about what you could do next – but we’ve got hundreds, probably thousands of people across the institutions as a whole ,\u0026nbsplosing their jobs en masse if Brexit goes ahead.\u0026nbspThey don’t know when it is, there’s no clear communication, and there’s no attempt to give advice – they’ve basically been completely shunned. It’s a disgrace the way the staff have been treated.”BBC accused of ‘normalising white supremacist language’ by MEPsTories back far-right government of Viktor Orban in crunch EU voteParliament isn’t perfect – in Brussels or WestminsterThe uncertainty, Scott Cato says, reflects what many employers around Britain are facing because of Brexit.The problems aren’t all logistical: more personally, the uncertainty has also dampened goodbyes. As with any workplace that closes, staffers have been planning their last goodbye drinks and farewells to people they’ve worked with for years. But the news of a delay has left them unsure this week if this really is the last time they’ll work together.The “big bang”\u0026nbspof leaving on 29 March 2019 is no longer happening. Parliamentary authorities say they have contingency plans for all outcomes, but the likelihood is it won’t be obvious what’s going to happen until the last minute.Everyone in Strasbourg has an opinion on the matter: but the truth is that nobody knows for sure whether the British caravan will ever return, model elephants in tow.We’ll tell you what’s true.

We had a really constructive process of engaging with him. At no point was he instinctively against this, Mr Kyle told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.Moments, later Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, cast doubt on the position.\u0026nbspWhat it says in that amendment is that any deal should be subject to a second public vote, Mr Gardiner told Sky News.\u0026nbspThat would mean even if our preferred option of a new customs union and an alignment of rights were to get through, that would also perhaps be knocked out by a second public vote.\u0026nbspThat has not been our party\u0027s position so far, he added.\u0026nbspSir Oliver Letwin, the architect of the plan for the Commons to stage a series of indicative votes on the way forward on\u0026nbspBrexit, warned that if Theresa May tried to ignore the outcome, MPs could seek to force her to act.\u0026nbspSpeaking on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme he said:\u0026nbspIf on Monday one or more propositions get a majority backing in the House of Commons, then we will have to work with the Government to implement them.The way I would hope it would happen under those circumstances is that we would have sensible, workmanlike discussions across the House of Commons and the Government would move forward in an orderly fashion.If the Government didn\u0027t agree to that, then those who I am working with across the parties will move to legislate to mandate the Government - if we can obtain majorities in the House of Commons and House of Lords for that - to carry that forward.Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk are addressing the European Parliament,\u0026nbspSpeaking in Strasbourg, Mr Tusk said the EU should be open to a long extension.\u0026nbspBefore the European Council I said we should be open to a long extension if the UK wants to rethink its Brexit strategy, which would of course mean the UK\u0027s participation in the European Parliament elections.Then there were voices saying that this would be harmful or inconvenient to some of you: let me be clear, such thinking is unacceptable.Mr Tusk also added that the petition to revoke Article 50, which has been signed be almost six million people, should not be ignored.\u0026nbspYou cannot betray the six million people who signed a petition to revoke Article 50, the one million people who marched for a people\u0027s vote, or the increasing majority of people who want to remain in the European Union.\u0026nbspThey may feel that they are not sufficiently represented by the UK parliament but they must feel that they are represented by you in this chamber because they are Europeans.Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said the Government hopes to be able to bring Theresa May\u0027s\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal back to the Commons this week for a third meaningful vote.I think that there is a real possibility that it does. We are completely determined to make sure that we can get enough support to bring it back.The Prime Minister said she is working hard, as many colleagues are, to persuade colleagues to support it.Mrs Leadsom refused to be drawn on whether Theresa May should commit to standing down once the Withdrawal Agreement is passed in order to win over wavering MPs.I am fully supporting the Prime Minister to get us out of the European Union, she said.Asked if Mrs May should stand down after that, she said: I think that is a matter for her. I am not expressing a view.Speaking outside his townhouse in Westminster, Jacob Rees-Mogg said he has not changed his opinion that Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s deal is a bad deal.I haven\u0027t changed my mind about the deal - it is still a bad deal and doesn\u0027t properly deliver\u0026nbspBrexit. The risk is, if I don\u0027t back it, we don\u0027t leave the EU at all.Mr Tusk criticised MEPs who told him that possible UK participation in forthcoming elections to the European Parliament if Britain sought a longer extension to Article 50 would be harmful or inconvenient.The European Council president told the European Parliament: Let me be clear, such thinking is unacceptable.You cannot betray the six million people who signed the petition to revoke Article 50, the one million people who marched for a people\u0027s vote, or the increasing majority of people who want to remain in the European Union.They may feel that they are not sufficiently represented by their UK Parliament, but they must feel that they are represented by you in this chamber because they are Europeans.Mr Rees-Mogg said the British public had been let down by MPs. He said the alternative\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspvotes scheduled for Wednesday were just about MPs trying to thwart\u0026nbspBrexit.We ought to be leaving on Friday at 11 o\u0027clock with or without a deal but that\u0027s not the situation we find ourselves in.They (MPs) didn\u0027t like the result, they thought the British people have got it wrong, that\u0027s what today is all about.European Parliament\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspco-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt attacked claims that the EU had tried to humiliate and punish the UK.He told the European Parliament: You know what the problem is? The problem of the humiliation and punishment is because of the mess in the Tory Party - there is the humiliation of the British people.Theresa May could bring back her\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal to the Commons this week amid signs growing numbers of Tory rebels are now ready to back it, a senior Cabinet minister has said.Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom said there was a real possibility there would be sufficient support for the Government to stage a third meaningful vote, either on Thursday or Friday.She said ministers were continuing to talk to MPs - including those in the DUP, who prop up the Government at Westminster and whose votes may be crucial in determining the outcome.Mrs Leadsom told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: I think that there is a real possibility that it does (come back).We are completely determined to make sure that we can get enough support to bring it back.Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadWe’ll tell you what’s true.

She\u0026nbspnow has until April 12 to offer new proposals to Brussels with new proposals\u0026nbspor see the UK leave without a deal that day.Asked whether an election was now becoming a clear possibility one Cabinet source told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspwithout hesitation:\u0026nbsp“Yes. Absolutely. No question.”There has\u0026nbspbeen speculation that the vote itself was set up for 29 March to make a show of Jeremy\u0026nbspCorbyn’s party voting against Brexit ahead of a pending election campaign.MPs reject Theresa May\u0027s deal for a third time after last throw of diceWhat are\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspvoting on today and what does it all mean?Police braced for potential unrest after threats of far-right riots\u0027I\u0027m past caring. It\u0027s like the living dead in here,\u0027 says cabinet memberLen McCluskey has joined the chorus of voices calling for a general election.\u0026nbspThe deadlock can only be broken by a General Election or by a free vote across the Commons on the range of options available, the Unite general secretary said in a statement.\u0026nbspOn Monday, MPs should agree a new approach based around a Customs Union between Britain and the European Union.Opposition leaders in Ireland are deeply unhappy after today\u0027s events in Westminster.\u0026nbspMary Lou McDonald, Sinn Fein\u0027s leader, criticised the political circus in the House of Commons and said it was increasing the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit.The behaviour of the DUP has been reckless and outrageous, she said.They have been seduced by the games at Westminster at the cost of farmers, the economy and the views of the majority in the north.Our economy, the rights of citizens and our hard-won agreements cannot be collateral damage to Westminster.Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin said a further extension to Article 50 was needed to ease tensions.We now are in an extremely serious situation, Mr Martin told RTE Radio One.It\u0027s time perhaps to give time to it in terms of an extension and to calm things down.With May’s Brexit deal seen off for a third time, it’s now looking more likely that we are heading for a general election, argues our columnist Rachel Shabi.\u0026nbspThe ERG, the Scottish Nationalists and the Labour Party are all calling for May to go. And we can’t keep going on like this.Read her piece, on the inevitability of a looming election, here:\u0026nbsphttps:www.voicestheresa-may-brexit-meaningful-vote-parliament-general-election-a8846156.htmlNicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u0027s First Minister, has said the SNP will work with other parties to find a way forward on Brexit after Theresa May\u0027s deal was rejected for the third time.The SNP has also said that it would like\u0026nbspa debate to be held discussing\u0026nbspConservative MP Nick Boles\u0027 Common Market 2.0 plan.Mr Boles said he welcomed the indication of support.Strongly welcome this indication of SNP support for Common Market 2.0, the MP said on Twitter.We have modified the motion in response to their concerns. I hope they feel able to vote for it on Monday.\u0026nbspA second MP has reported\u0026nbspbeing harassed by protesters in Parliament Square today.\u0026nbspJoanna Cherry, SNP justice and home affairs spokeswoman said she was relieved to leave Westminster following a day of protests.\u0026nbspVery relieved to be safely back to my base in London, she said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWas abused by trailing ends of the Leave Means Leave protest as I walked home. Called a traitor.\u0026nbspTold to go back to my own country.\u0026nbspHundreds of pro-Brexit protesters have filled Parliament Square today.\u0026nbspLisa Nandy, Labour MP for Wigan, earlier said she was accosted while outside parliament.A general election is looming after Theresa May\u0027s withdrawal agreement was defeated for a third time on Friday.\u0026nbspThe prime minister has strongly hinted that she is considering taking the country to the polls.\u0026nbspThere has also been speculation that Friday\u0027s vote was designed to make a show of Jeremy Corbyn’s party voting against Brexit ahead of a pending election campaign.\u0026nbspOur political editor Joe Watts has more:\u0026nbsphttps:www.newsukpoliticsbrexit-deal-general-election-britain-theresa-may-uk-a8846366.htmlLisa Nandy,the Labour MP for Wigan, has said she was\u0026nbspaccosted outside parliament before Friday\u0027s vote.\u0026nbspToday outside Parliament I and others were accosted by people shouting f****** traitor as we tried to get in to vote, she said, in a post on Twitter.\u0026nbspOur staff were advised to leave the building for their own safety. There were armed police everywhere. This is not normal.\u0026nbspHundreds of pro-Brexit protesters remain\u0026nbspgathered in Whitehall and Parliament Square on what was supposed to be the day the UK left the European Union.Vote Leave has dropped its appeal against the Electoral Commission\u0027s findings that the organisation committed multiple offences under electoral law during the 2016 referendum campaign.\u0026nbspWe have been advised that Vote Leave has paid its £61,000 fine and look forward to receiving the sum in full, an Electoral Commission spokesperson said.When\u0026nbspTheresa May steps down, what will her\u0026nbsplegacy as prime minister be?\u0026nbspOur columnist\u0026nbspPatrick Cockburn\u0026nbspargues that she should be remembered for her\u0026nbsplethal blend of tunnel vision and obstinacy that automatically produces ill-judged decisions.\u0026nbspHer list of blunders is too long to repeat here but must include her decision to treat the outcome of the EU referendum as if it was a decisive choice by the British people, he writes.\u0026nbspRead more here:\u0026nbsphttps:www.voicesbrexit-vote-theresa-may-defeat-good-friday-agreement-irish-backstop-a8846111.html?utm_mediumSocial\u0026amputm_sourceTwitter#Echobox1553880445\u0026nbspNigel Farage has appeared in front of pro-Brexit protesters in Parliament Square.\u0026nbspFrankly, I believe that\u0026nbspwhat\u0027s happened over there, has not just turned this day that should\u0027ve been one\u0026nbspof great celebration into a day that history will mark as a day of great\u0026nbspbetrayal, he said\u0026nbspI believe that what\u0027s happened over the course of two years is\u0026nbspactually one of the saddest and worst chapters in the history of our nation.\u0026nbspLeo Varadkar, Ireland\u0027s\u0026nbspprime minister, has said the EU\u0026nbspmust be open to a long extension of Article 50 if the UK decides to fundamentally reconsider its approach to Brexit.\u0026nbspThe Government notes the decision of the House of Commons to reject the indicative withdrawal agreement, he said in a statement released after Friday\u0027s vote.It is now up to the UK to indicate how it plans to proceed in order to avoid a no-deal scenario.The European Council has agreed unanimously that the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened.I believe we must be open to a long extension should the United Kingdom decide to fundamentally reconsider its approach to Brexit and put back on the table options previously ruled out.I believe that will result in a generous and understanding response from the 27.French President\u0026nbspEmmanuel Macron\u0026nbsphas said that if the British parliament does not approve Theresa May’s\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal by 12 April then Europe would decide with Britain on the timeframe for its exit.It came moments before MPs\u0026nbspon Thursday\u0026nbsprejected\u0026nbspthe British prime minister\u0027s attempt\u0026nbspto get her\u0026nbspwithdrawal agreement through Parliament.The implications of the House\u0027s decision are grave, the legal default now is that the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on 12 April, Ms May told the Commons after her latest defeat.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsphttps:www.newsukpoliticsbrexit-no-deal-macron-france-eu-theresa-may-vote-commons-a8845676.htmlThe UK is now likely to crash out of the European Union in two weeks\u0027 time after\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0027s failure to win support from MPs for her withdrawal agreement, the EU Commission has said.In dramatic scenes, MPs\u0026nbsprejected Ms May\u0027s deal for the third time by 58 votes, as hundreds of\u0026nbspprotesters filled the streets of Westminster to demonstrate their fury at the delay to\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspday.The prime minister\u0026nbspnow has until April 12 to come up with a new plan to take to Brussels so she can secure a longer extension to the negotiations or crash out without a deal.\u0026nbsphttps:www.newsukpoliticsbrexit-no-deal-theresa-may-vote-result-deadline-commons-a8845736.htmlChris Grayling - the transport secretary - told the BBC after the defeat:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat the House has just done is to vote effectively to leave this country either leaving the EU on April 12 with no deal, reversing Brexit or kicking it into the far long grass.I don\u0027t think that\u0027s what the majority in this country wants. We are going to have to think very hard over the next few hours how we respond to that. This is a hugely disappointing response that is absolutely not in the national interest.Solicitor general Robert Buckland told the BBC: The prospect of no Brexit is becoming a very real one indeed.Mr Buckland said that among MPs there had been a lot of wishful thinking about being able to go back time and time again and not enough thinking about things from the EU\u0027s point of view.He warned: We can\u0027t guarantee we will get a further extension. That very much depends on what the French and other countries think. We are in completely uncharted waters.The European Commission has released a statement following vote, calling no-deal a likely scenario.The statement reads: The Commission regrets the negative vote in the House of Commons today.As per the European Council (Article 50) decision on 22 March, the period provided for in Article 50(3) is extended to 12 April.It will be for the UK to indicate the way forward before that date, for consideration by the European Council.A \u0027no-deal\u0027 scenario on 12 April is now a likely scenario. The EU has been preparing for this since December 2017 and is now fully prepared for a \u0027no-deal\u0027 scenario at midnight on 12 April. The EU will remain united.The benefits of the Withdrawal Agreement, including a transition period, will in no circumstances be replicated in a \u0027no-deal\u0027 scenario. Sectoral mini-deals are not an option.\u0026nbspDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: The Democratic Unionist Party has consistently and repeatedly indicated that we could not support the Withdrawal Agreement because of the construction of the backstop.We have reached this view from a principled position as we do not believe the Withdrawal Agreement is the best way forward for the United Kingdom.He added that good progress had been made in talks with the Government on domestic legislation to ensure the economic integrity of the UK but sufficient progress has not been made.Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadWe’ll tell you what’s true.

the best prepared, Mr Macron said in remarks delivered as May pleaded with lawmakers before putting the doomed, stripped-down version of her deal to another vote.But Brexit is now most likely on course for a lengthy delay, after Ms May’s withdrawal agreement lost by a margin of 58 votes.\u0026nbspNo-deal Brexit likely on April 12 after May’s latest failure, says EULive: Frustrated May lashes out at MPs after deal rejected againIn dramatic scenes in the House of Commons, MPs voted by 344 to 286 against the deal as hundreds of protesters staged a noisy demonstration outside on the day when the UK was due to leave the European Union.The result of the crunch vote means that the UK has missed an EU deadline to secure an extension of the Brexit process and leave with a deal on 22 May.Ms\u0026nbspMay now has until 12 April\u0026nbspto go back to Brussels with new proposals and seek a longer extension to the negotiation process, or see the UK leave without a deal that day.With a clear majority in the Commons against no deal, and with MPs once more seizing control of the timetable on Monday, Ms May said that the UK would have to find “an alternative way forward”.This was “almost certain” to involve the UK having to stage elections to the European Parliament in May, she said.European Council president Donald Tusk called an emergency summit of EU leaders in Brussels on 10 April\u0026nbspto discuss the implications of the vote.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for a general election unless the prime minister was willing to find an alternative deal.Additional

Conservative\u0026nbspand Labour MPs\u0026nbspsent shockwaves\u0026nbspthrough Westminster\u0026nbspwith their promise of a different kind of politics.Their move prompted huge interest, with anger from former colleagues jostling alongside curiosity from those left politically homeless by\u0026nbspshifts in direction from both Labour and the Tories.The TIGs, as they are known,\u0026nbsphave now applied to be an official political party called Change UK – The Independent Group, with former Tory MP Heidi Allen stepping up as interim leader.Sources told The Independent\u0026nbspthey were forced to speed up their preparations to ensure they could field candidates in the European elections in May, as repeated defeats of Theresa May’s Brexit deal have cast doubt on whether the UK would be compelled to take part.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave

to the roiling Brexit cauldron, where old alliances no longer hold and Labour MPs\u0026nbspback the prime minister while her own benches repeatedly rebel.But could it make a real difference to the outcome?Ms May’s lack of a majority –\u0026nbspand inability to control her own backbenchers –\u0026nbspheaps extra importance on the parliamentary arithmetic, and, when it comes to the\u0026nbspnumbers, the TIGs are a known quantity.Independent Group applies to be political party for EU electionsThe three rebel Tories –\u0026nbspMs\u0026nbspAllen, Anna Soubry\u0026nbspand Sarah Wollaston –\u0026nbspwere all vocal supporters of a second referendum before resigning the party whip. Former frontbencher Chuka Umunna and his fellow Labour splitters were also unashamedly pro-European while still in Jeremy Corbyn’s party.So the TIGs\u0026nbspwill not swing the balance either way but they do wield a different kind of power.The Labour leadership is said to have been rattled by the loss of eight MPs\u0026nbspin two days and the fear of further defections piles the pressure on party bosses to try to keep MPs in the tent.Brexit was one of the\u0026nbspkey factors for Labour quitters so\u0026nbspthe leadership will be well aware of the need to keep wavering\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspon board.\u0026nbspIf Labour whipped its MPs to back a Final Say option during next week’s further\u0026nbspindicative votes, then the idea would have a real shot.In a way, it is perhaps the future of the TIGs that will be determined by Brexit, rather than the other way around. If the UK ends up with a long extension then the distrust among swing voters may count in their favour and give them a cause.But they also need to stake ground on other issues or risk being drowned\u0026nbspout. One MP involved said they\u0026nbspwould “deserve to fail if all we were was anti-Brexit” – advice they would do well to heed.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Heres what you need to know.The EU customs union is a free trade agreement for goods.It dfers from the single market which also includes free movement of labour, services and capital.The European Unions customs union is a trade agreement between all EU member states and three other countries - Turkey, Andorra and San Marino - which allows goods to be shipped all around the EU as long as they clear customs in one participating country.The countries sit down and decide to apply the same tarfs to goods from outside the union.Britains membership of the customs union stops us negotiating free trade agreements with other countries - a key campaign pledge of the successful Leave campaign during the EU referendum in .Leaving has the potential to cause problems with the Irish border and for certain sectors of industry.Leaving would lead to mandatory customs checks for every lorry from Britain to the EU unless a free trade deal is struck with Brussels.Theresa May has long been clear she will seek to leave the single market and the customs union - allowing Britain to escape the authority of Brussels and strike its own global trade deals.EU leaders warned the UK cannot access the single market while also capping immigration on people from its member states - one of the PMs so-called red lines outlined in her famous Mansion House speech.European Council President Donald Tusk and the EU want the UK to respect:On March , , MPs voted to block a No Deal Brexit.However this has not scuppered plans to still quit the customs union.Britain was scheduled to depart the EU on March , , at pm.But  days before, MPs voted to delay Brexit, until at least June .Whenever Brexit Day will take place, there will be a transition or implementation period which is currently slated to last until December .Extending Article  would give Parliament more time to finalise a deal.After a crunch summit at Chequers in the summer of , the PM and her Cabinet put forward her strategy for Britains post-Brexit relationship with the EU.One of the central points of her plan is a facilitated customs arrangement which will allow the UK to set its own tarfs on goods arrival in the country.Borders between the UK and EU would be treated as a combined customs territory and would see the UK apply tarfs and trade policies for goods destined for the UK but charge EU tarfs for goods bound for the EU.The Government believes this system removes the threat of a hard border in Ireland. If Britain leaves the single market and customs union, it may not be given the same complete freedom to move money, people and products around the EU.The European Union will only allow the UK to be part of the European single marketit continues to allow EU nationals the right to live and work in the UK.And being a member of the customs union would stop the UK striking free trade deals with other nations.Theresa May and Olly Robbins, her chief Brexit adviser from the Civil Service, have floated the idea of a scheme which would see Britain continue to collect tarfs on behalf of the EU for goods which enter the UK which are destined for member states.Boris Johnson has said he would support Mays Brexit dealshe secures a major change to the backstop so the UK doesnt get stuck in the EU customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If the deal fails again it seems Philip Hammond and David Lidington will be knocking on the PM’s door to tell her the time has come to make an exit.But in the midst of this paralysing crisis even that is not an easy option.There is no clear route to appointing a successor in the short term. And with the party at loggerheads even a swt transition to a caretaker PM is perilous.After this week’s turmoil we face being stuck for some time with a lame-duck Prime Minister, whoever it may be.Britain needs a miracle to avoid it.The crushing of IS in Syria is a massive achievement.Defeating this self-proclaimed caliphate is the beginning of the end for a reign of terror which has claimed , lives and spawned , attacks over four bloody years.The courage and sacrice of the ­Western-backed forces that fought so fiercely to drive the jihadis from their final stronghold has been rightly praised by Theresa May.But she was also wise to caution that the ousting of the religious fanatics from their territory will not end the risk they pose.Many hardened fighters will go to ground in the area so they can continue to wage guerrilla warfare.Other dangerous extremists will no doubt flee to Europe and even to this country, still fuelled by their murderous hatred of the West.Like the mythical hydra with its many heads, cutting off one risks generating others in its place.Our security forces must now be on alert for a fresh wave of Islamic-inspired terror closer to home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But she has lost the backing of much of the country and now her party.Her deal has only one, slim chance of achieving a majority in the ­Commons.That isshe pledges ­immediately to resign and set in motion the election of her successor as Tory leader and PM after we leave the EU on the new deadline of May .If she does so, Tory Brexiteers and the DUP must back the deal. Becauseit fails again this week we are heading for a much softer Brexit — or none.That will be a catastrophe for the country, the Tories and Parliament.Mrs May deserves huge credit. She is a dedicated public servant with an unshakeable sense of duty, who in  took on the greatest challenge of any PM since World War Two.She has stuck to it through thick and thin, showing remarkable resilience in the face of repeated humiliations, rebellions and a relentless barrage of vitriol from almost all-comers.Unlike so many she has determinedly respected the will of the Leave majority. The very concept of democracy has been degraded in many other countries, yet she has ­resolutely defended ours.She must now take the next principled step — and show she is not just another craven politician determined to cling to power.Mrs May has insisted all along that not only must the referendum result be honoured, as promised by both main parties, but that it must mean leaving the EU’s central institutions — the Single Market and Customs Union — as well as the remit of its courts.She has maintained that the power to trade independently outside the Brussels club must be secured. It is the economic prize of Brexit.This was exactly the right course. Those arguing to soften those red lines are almost entirely those who regret Brexit and wish to neutralise it.Sadly, many mistakes were made. A Remainer, Mrs May appointed a weak Cabinet of Remainer friends, most of whom considered Brexit a disaster to be managed rather than a historic opportunity to exploit.The Brexiteers she did appoint — David Davis, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and later Dominic Raab — were sidelined and ignored.The Government triggered Article  far too early without a plan for our departure. In hindsight it should have made rapid plans for No Deal from the outset, giving us a position of strength from which to negotiate.Mrs May said “No Deal is better than a bad deal”, only to have Treasury bureaucrats refuse to prepare for it.After her disastrous  election her sole focus became achieving Brexit while holding her party’s warring factions together and fending off Remainer rebellions in Parliament.While our economy, employment and wages have grown strongly there has been policy paralysis, with mediocre ministers left blundering along. We need not list here all Britain’s problems. They are many, and obvious.Her Brexit deal is not the worst imaginable. Those are the so-called Norway Plus option — which is not Brexit in any way — or the permanent Customs Union, brainlessly championed by Corbyn, which destroys the economic case for leaving.No one should pretend it is a great deal either. But it ensures that Brexit finally happens, ending the fractious Leave Remain debate and refocusing Britain on the far more crucial negotiations for a future trade agreement.The DUP and the Tory ERG will have to hold their noses and vote for it. And to win that unlikely support, Mrs May must set in place a truly dignied exit, culminating in a new leader.Theresa May will then go down in history as a great public servant, as the leader who delivered Brexit and proved to the British people that our democracy is robust and far, far more important than any inidual.PM, it’s time to move on.MAKE no mistake: the kne crime epidemic is now a national crisis.It’s tempting to think that it’s just gangs in London and our other biggest cities that are the cause of rising violence.But shocking figures demonstrating how far and wide this disease has spread must be a wake-up call for the police, the Home Office and the Cabinet.That we’ve now got young gangsters playing sick games in which points are awarded for stabbing certain parts of the body can lead to only one conclusion: we’ve completely lost control of our streets.Throughout the spike in violent crime, the Government has responded with a tin ear. They’ve allowed the Labour Party — under Jeremy Corbyn of all people — to become the party of law and order.At the last election, the Tories got a battering about police cuts and it was one signicant reason they lost their majority.With the very real possibility of another ballot coming soon, the Home Secretary Sajid Javid and the Chancellor must get a grip.It’s vital that they give police chiefs the cash and the powers that they need.OUR prisons are failing.The latest revelation, that drugs and phones are being smuggled in via the inside of dead rats, is just a symptom of the mess they’re in.Prisons should keep people who deserve it locked up and get them ready for a le on the straight and narrow.The Justice Secretary is considering scrapping short sentences because prisons are doing such a bad job of rehabbing people, leaving offenders on our streets who should be behind bars.And eventhey do end up inside, with violence on the up, it’s no surprise lags form rival gangs. That turns prisons into training centres for hardened criminals.Where is the Government  Promises of reform and a crackdown on violence seem to have produced precious little.The consequences of a busted prison system will be felt on our streets.SO-CALLED Islamic State might not have any physical presence left, but we can’t be complacent about the murderous ideology they spread across the world.Their promise of a reign of terror across the continent sends a chill down the spine.We must find and prosecute those IS fighters who have ed to the UK — believed to be as many as  — and spare us the inevitable leftie hand-wringing.There have already been far too many innocent victims of IS’s twisted dogma.We must do everything possible to ensure there are no more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Far from it. I have been a fan of the Aberdeen fishmonger’s son for a quarter of a century.As Education Secretary, he proved he has the brain and balls to take on both Brussels and the public sector “Blob” he blames for sabotaging effective government.But his credibility seemed shot after he signed up to Mrs May’s botched BRINO — Brexit In Name Only.He was also bruised by his reputation for kning his pal David Cameron and then fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson. Friends claim he did not want to be labelled with a third count of disloyalty.Today his judgment seems rather shrewd, coupled with his recent morale-boosting Commons attack on Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist rabble.Faced with the risk of losing Brexit altogether — and likely defeat in a snap election — there is an outside chance BRINO will limp over the line at the third time of asking.If DUP MPs sign up — andTheresa May promises to step aside — Brexiteers might fall in behind.There are too many “s” in that sentence for comfort but despite Speaker John Bercow’s chicanery, a last-gasp victory is still possible. Which puts Mr Gove, , up against a cavalry of leadership rivals.  DAVID LIDINGTON, . The “deputy PM” is an even bigger surprise as joint-favourite. He is mooted by Europhile ministers such as Amber Rudd as caretaker PMMrs May is dumped.Leavers including ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith are dismayed by their “appalling disloyalty”.“They should be censured, sacked or, at the very least, apologise and they should shut up,” he stormed yesterday.  BORIS JOHNSON, .

Signicantly, he was twice invited as a powerbroker into No last week to save her deal. Might yet be persuaded.  DOMINIC RAAB, .

A winnerhe is the only Brexiter on the shortlist.  JEREMY HUNT, . Smooth-talking Foreign Secretary and multi-millionaire businessman.Mr Hunt switched to become a Leaver after voting in  to stay in the EU. Brexiteers are suspicious of late converts, especially those who remained in Cabinet under Mrs May.  SAJID JAVID, . This son of a Pakistani bus driver who rose to become Home Secretary should be a frontrunner for the top job.But like Jeremy Hunt, he is haunted by his decision to back Remain despite posing as a strong Eurosceptic.  ANDREA LEADSOM, . The Commons Leader would be PM nowshe hadn’t flunked her leadership bid and blocked Gove.She has forged new respect by taking on slyly vicious Speaker Bercow.Unranked dark horse MATT HANCOCK, . The new Health Secretary suffers from being a George Osborne protege. But even Brexiteers believe him to be his own man.A prominent Leaver tells me: “Matt is highly intelligent, extraordinarily able. He has the potential to be PM.”If politics is a numbers game, here are some  referendum statistics to help MPs as they weigh up their options for Theresa May’s successor.Leave won in the  Referendum by .million against Remain’s .million.Leave constituencies outnumbered Remain by  to .Of these, Tory Leavers outnumbered Remainers by  to  and Labour’s by  to .In Parliament,  MPs support Leave, while  back Remain.There is a message about our future political stability in those figures.Now he claims No Deal will create a medicines crisis and turn Kent into a car park.Britain has proved him wrong, with investment rising, more jobs and higher pay – while his beloved European Union lumbers towards recession and le on the dole for under-s.

Stop-gap agreements are in place.But, and it’s a huge but, the harsh, unavoidable truth is that No Deal — while technically in Theresa May’s gt — is not available.Our Remainer-stacked Parliament will use every trick in the book to block it.That’s the practical political reality. Outrageous, but true.Yes, admittedly, leaving with No Deal is for now the legal default. But anti-Brexit MPs have the numbers to wrest control of the Parliamentary agenda and pass primary legislation to prevent No Deal.That is why all Honourable members who believe in democracy must hold their collective nose and back Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement — which, while deeply imperfect, at least gets Brexit over the line. Andthat backing is conditional on May standing down, even better.Britain needs a Prime Minister who sees Brexit not as a disaster to be managed, but a chance for national renewal.Mrs May can still secure Brexit, and salvage some dignity,her agreement gets through. But she must then make way for someone with genuine vision to negotiate our future EU relationship.Her deal is, of course, ghastly. It leaves Britain without voice, vote or veto over EU law-making and subject to European Court of Justice jurisdiction.We hand over £billion we don’t technically owe.This terrible outcome reflects her botched  election and lack of negotiating nous.Labour’s cynical ambivalence, with Jeremy Corbyn trying to wreck Brexit and spark a general election, hasn’t helped.Big business has lobbied hard, with corporate vested interests determined to keep Britain in the EU’s protectionist customs union and smaller rivals ensnared in red tape.And we have seen epic intransigence from Brussels to make Brexit as tough as possible in order to discourage others from leaving.We can still leave, though, as long as pro-Brexit MPs don’t fall into Brussels’ trap.Last week’s EU summit granted Mrs May an “un-conditional” Article  extension from March  to April .The EU’s aim was to encourage the European Research Groupof Tory Leavers to keep voting down Mrs May’s agreement, in the hope we would default to No Deal.France’s President Emmanuel Macron is now calling on the EU to “just get rid of the UK”.Anonymous eurocrats want to cut off “the gangrenous limb” that is Britain.It is all just spin, designed to fool Brexiteers into rejecting Mrs May’s deal and giving Commons ultra-Remainers the chance, before April , to thwart No Deal, tipping the UK into a long Article  extension period in which Brexit can be entirely crushed.Look at the damage the Remainer establishment has already done, consistently undermining Brexit since losing the June  referendum. Think of the additional damagethe EU forces us into a much longer delay.That is why the ERG must back the Withdrawal Agreement. Mrs May’s deal may stink but it gets us out of the EU’s legal structures once and for all.Let’s take this opportunity to make Brexit irreversible, killing off the danger and further uncertainty of a deeply isive second referendum — which would be disastrous not just for democracy, but also UK investment.For once the Withdrawal Agreement has passed and we have left the EU, negotiations between London and Brussels will become more technocratic and much less heated.The political temperature will drop, allowing us all to move on from this tortuous impasse.Once Britain has left, we can then fight our way out of Mrs May’s terrible deal.International law is, in large part, a matter of public opinion and power-broking.The world will see, once the US and China are clamouring to do trade deals with Britain, that the EU is being entirely unreasonable trying to keep us locked in its insular customs union.Post-Brexit, the Irish will also come on side, helping to solve “border issues” which were always entirely solvable.That is, once Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has saved face and “not backed down to the Brits” ahead of our withdrawal.Why did “B******s-to-Brexit” John Bercow prevent MPs voting on Mrs May’s deal this month  Because he could see it was going to get through the Commons.Leading ERG members were onside, and the DUP were very close, which would have unlocked the cascade of -odd Labour MPs from Leave constituencies who want Brexit — enough to get us legally and psychologically over the line.Brexit “true believers” have a choice. They can “never surrender” and let Mrs May’s deal die. That would result in a long Article  delay, risking the entire Brexit project, which would be a democratic calamity.Or they can show political savvy and bank this deal, making our EU withdrawal irreversible, before finishing the job of securing an advantageous future relationship under a new pro-Brexit Prime Minister.The only way for the UK toto moderate politics after our historic June  referendum, is to leave the EU. The only way to ensure that, from where we are now, is to back Mrs May’s agreement.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So indulge me for a few moments and step into my time machine. Imagine that it’s June , , the day after this country’s historic vote to leave the EU and, with artistic licence, that Margaret Thatcher is in charge.Like her or loathe her, what would Maggie in her heyday have done Well, for starters, she would have harboured, and probably displayed with gusto, a healthy mistrust for the likes of Juncker, Macron et al, treating them as favoured yet potentially naughty boys who might need bringing to heel at any moment.She would have known full well it was in their interests for Britain’s exit from the EU to fail miserably on the basis that success might encourage others to follow our lead.With that, and a very clear mandate from .million of the electorate in mind, she would have made a stirring speech about how the Brits love their continental neighbours and still consider themselves to be European . . . And then would come the all-important . . . “but” that’s crucial to any successful negotiation.After which she would have made it patently clear that, while our love of Europe remains undiminished, our love of the EU — an important distinction that ardent Remainers wilfully ignore in their bid to paint the referendum result as xenophobic — has withered on the vine.In other words, the relationship with Brussels is over but we would like to remain firm friends.And finally, she would have pointed out, in characteristically strong terms, that the ball was now in the EU’s court as to whether to play nice or not.But just in case they didn’t, the nation that managed to invent tanks, steam engines, lawnmowers, hovercrafts, the saline drip, fire extinguishers, telephones, vacuums, hypnotism, disc brakes, colour photography, bouncing bombs, slide rules, sewing machines, radarlong before the EU was even a twinkle in its founding fathers’ eyes, would make sure that it was prepared for all eventualities in the future.Including just crashing out with absolutely no deal whatsoever.And thatthat happened, she would make it perfectly clear for the rest of time that any short-term chaos for Britain and the rest of Europe would be laid at the door of those in the EU who were given the chance to facilitate a smooth transition for all but refused to take it.How would that go down with, say, the German and French car manufacturers who need to trade with us as much we need  to trade with them As for all those getting very excited about the comparatively paltry number of Remainers who attended the anti-Brexit march in London at the weekend, Maggie would have resolutely reminded the agitating metropolitan elite that .million voted to Leave and, as PM of a democracy, it’s her job to deliver on that result.Simple really.Sadly, back in the real world, the PM we can’t seem to shake off has snatched defeat from the jaws of a clear mandate for victory.And whatever her strong points may be, her legacy will be one of abject failure to deliver.FORMER footballer and Celeb Big Brother star Jermaine Pennant says he and we Alice Goodwin had a brief separation over Christmas after falling out over baby plans.In short, he wanted to start a family but -year-old Alice wanted to wait and, after an explosive row, they unfollowed each other on social media which – saints preserve us – is seemingly the modern-day equivalent of marital Armageddon.The couple have since reunited, but perhaps this hiccup should act as a salutary lesson to anyone thinking of getting married.Have the “do you want children and when ” conversation before you skip down the aisle.WHILE his peers were still in bed or playing Fortnite – or whatever it is -year-old boys do these days – young Peter Rees-Mogg was attending the Brexit crisis talks at Chequers with his father Jacob.Er, why Last time I looked, it wasn’t “bring your child to work day”, and given the other five Rees-Mogglets weren’t in attendance, presumably it wasn’t a childcare crisis that necessitated his presence.There can only be one explanation: He was there to throw in his school cap for a leadership challenge.Let’s face it, he’d doubtless do a better job than the current one.REVENGE porn victim Sophia Ankel has courageously waived her right to anonymity to highlight her call for it to be treated as sexual abuse.She’s absolutely right, of course.— A SURVEY has shown that only five per cent of teenagers are interested in pursuing a job in science. And yet the national curriculum still forces all  to -year-olds to take compulsory chemistry physics biology – or iations thereof – while having to drop other subjects they might enjoy and therefore do better in. Where’s the scientic logic in that STRICTLY pro Karen Clton wept on Instagram after being turned away from a barber shop that refused to cut her hair because she’s a woman.“I felt crap.

With Europhiles having ripped up centuries of parliamentary procedure, clownish Tory toff Sir Oliver Letwin MP will be put in charge of the Commons agenda — and will encourage Remain-leaning MPs to wreck Brexit.“Take back control of our destiny,” said .million Leave voters in the  referendum.“Make Britain independent again. Assert some authority to our Government.”That vote was the biggest expression of public will in the history of our kingdom. So what do our political class do Such is the Establishment’s desperation to keep us in the EU empire, it changes the rules and puts our legislature in the hands of an Eton-educated egghead who is so naive, so unplugged from the ways of the world, that he once admitted a burglar to his house at am.I talk, yes, of Sir Oliver “Loony” Letwin.That farcical pratfall from  is worth retelling because it gives you the calibre of this titan of twittishness.Remember, we are at the screaming peak of a national disaster, our country being made to look ridiculous and weak around the world.We are crying out for a Wellington or a Churchill. Yet this -year-old nitwit is the creature put in charge by Labour and Tory Remainers.In , Letwin was Shadow Home Secretary. Before dawn one day in January, he was at home in Kennington, South London, when the doorbell rang. Down he toddled in his flannel jimjams to find two wrong’uns on his step.Most of us, confronted by strangers at am, might at least keep the chain on the latch. Not Loony.The men claimed their car had broken down.“Can I use your loo ” said one. “Why, of course,” exclaimed the gullible Letwin.What happened next  Obvious. The burglar sauntered inside, had a rummage for valuables and legged it out the door with a stash of jewellery and Letwin’s wallet.As the whooping robbers scarpered, Sir Oliver just stood there in his slippers, squeaking: “Stop!”Now it is we, the supposedly sovereign British voters, who are in a similarly helpless position, as the anti-Brexit elite collude with Brussels to kill ’s Leave vote.The European Commission must hardly be able to believe its luck at the way treacherous Remainers have undermined our national position.When they look at the berk our once-mighty Parliament has put in charge of its agenda, they must be wetting themselves with laughter — just like those two burglars.Today’s manoeuvre is allegedly the Commons “taking back control” from broken PM Theresa May.But how can a House of  MPs, with roughly  dferent opinions, act as a government The reason we have a Prime Minister is so decisions ultimately rest with a single person — and that person must possess the authority of electoral support.If the head of government has not been voted into office, you can’t call it democracy.Yet that is what will happen today when Sir Oliver, with his gurgling giggles and Regency-fop airs, is put in charge of the Commons and gives MPs votes on numerous Brexit options.It promises to be chaotic. All it will likely achieve is a further weakening of Brexit.Our historic vote to quit the EU was a public castigation of remote politicians.Well, they don’t come much more disconnected than ballet-loving, philosophy-spouting Letwin. The son of American academics — his dad was an economics professor, his mum a Thatcherite pointyhead — he was reared on intellectualism.Like many exceedingly bookish people, he is little gripped by the popular or the practical. He lives in the clouds.At Cambridge University, his friends used to swap his pipe tobacco for dope and he didn’t notice. Perhaps he would make more sense when stoned.Back in those days, Letwin wore a bushy red beard and was known as Oliver Leftwing. His views altered to suit the rise of Thatcherism.For a while he was a prominent Eurosceptic who denounced EU federalism.Now the Establishment is anti-Brexit, Letwin has again changed his tune. He is so elastic, you could use his bushy eyebrows for women’s knickers.One of his first jobs, in the early s, was working for Tory thinker Sir Keith Joseph, the “Mad Monk”.Later, Letwin was the genius who dreamed up . . . the poll tax, that theoretically pure but hopelessly impractical local-tax policy that toppled Mrs T.It’s going some to get the normally placid British people to riot in Trafalgar Square. Let’s hope Letwin doesn’t repeat the trick with his obstruction of Brexit.William Hague’s election campaign in  was wrecked after Letwin, a shadow Treasury minister, shot his mouth off about the party’s spending intentions.In , Letwin — by then David Cameron’s chief policy adviser — was photographed dumping top-secret files on terrorism and national security in park bins near Downing Street. Letwin was also the bad fool who, over pizza late one night with Nick Clegg, dreamed up ways to stle the free Press.This is the ham-fisted monkey who will today be put in charge of our Parliament.Has British politics ever been more warped  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We highly doubt she will.She or any new Tory leader is more likely to risk an election than be forced to preside over the deliberate betrayal or cancellation of Brexit, about which Remainers are now openly salivating.Sadly, the likely result is Tory wipeout — with voters raging at their failure, Nigel Farage hoovering up Leavers — and Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street.What a result that will be for Letwin. Yes, he has had career highs before, what with convincing Maggie Thatcher to keep faith with the hated poll tax, dumping secret letters in a public bin, plotting with Hacked Off to shackle the Press and inviting burglars into his home.But triggering his own party’s destruction and ushering in years of Marxist rule, with millions losing jobs and our economy destroyed, would cap it all.Letwin is, technically, a clever man. No doubt the no-mark ex-ministers Richard Harrington, Alistair Burt and Steve Brine — who resigned their posts to back him — imagine they are too.Not one has the simple common sense to foresee the carnage they are unleashing.IT is hard to exaggerate how grim Tory MP Nick Boles’ “Norway Plus” or “Common Market .” idea would be for Britain.It means staying in the EU — Single Market, Customs Union and all — with no say over the rules. It fails to control immigration, keeps us paying vast fees and prevents our own trade deals.Brits have become more relaxed about migrant numbers because they thought Brexit would bring us control. Watch ­Norway Plus slam that into reverse.As for other options: new referendum  Revoke Article  and cancel Brexit If you’d like Britain to be more angry, ided and ungovernable, sure, try those.IF Uefa is serious about racism it must get tougher on Montenegro.A partial stadium ban and small fine won’t suffice for the vile “monkey” taunts at England’s black players.Five matches in an empty stadium might knock sense into their Neanderthal fans.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More than  years later, the mood is just the same.At a historic moment when statesmanship and vision are required, Britain is landed instead with crude partisanship and selfish provincialism.It is profoundly depressing that our great nation’s future should be guided by this tiny, unrepresentative platoon of charlatans and reactionaries.The DUP does not belong in the mainstream of British politics, but on its despised fringes.This is a nasty organisation with its roots in vicious Protestant sectarianism. Formed out of a loyalist vigilante group, the DUP was founded in  by fundamentalist Free Pres­byterian preacher Ian Paisley, who delighted in conflict.Determined to uphold Protestant rule in Northern Ireland, the DUP has a sinister history of flirtation with paramilitary outfits such as the Ulster Volunteer Force and Ulster Defence Association.I was only too aware of the party’s ugly influence on politics in Northern Ireland, for I was born in Belfast and spent all my upbringing during the Troubles.Ian Paisley’s booming, isive rhetoric was part of the soundtrack of my early le. I went to school in Enniskillen in the west of Ulster, a place called Portora Royal which prided itself on its tolerant, non-sectarian ethos.Among its former pupils were two of Ireland’s greatest writers, Oscar Wilde and Samuel Beckett. And one of my own contemporaries there was Nigel Dodds, now the leader of the DUP group at Westminster.He was intellectually brilliant but the hardline stance was always there.As one of my old teachers commented to me: “Nigel has been through  years of liberal education and has emerged entirely unscathed.”After growing up in this atmosphere of discord, it was a relief to escape in my twenties to England, where le was not dominated by the border or religion or security.But I feel only despair that the DUP, having exerted such a malignant influence in my homeland, should now be so dominant on the wider stage of British politics. The party’s shameful past is one of epic hypocrisy.During their attacks on Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement, DUP politicians such as Dodds like to blather about “the constitutional integrity” of the UK, arguing that Ulster must not be treated any dferently to England. But they don’t care about “constitutional integrity” when it comes to their own bigoted causes.They are happy for Ulster, uniquely in the British Isles, to have bans on same-sex marriage and abortion.But the DUP is continually in denial about reality. The party pretends to speak for Northern Ireland but gained only  per cent of the vote in the last General Election there.Furthermore, in the  EU referendum, the province vot­e­d overwhelmingly to Remain.Contrary to the DUP’s position, local people and businesses in Ulster are crying out for a deal to be agreed.After the experience of the Troubles, Northern Ireland needs a spirit of co-operation rather than the pathetic de­mand to die in the last ditch.Since the General Election of , the Government has wasted two years in negotiating Brexit but got nowhere. And Tories’ dependence on the DUP is partly to blame.Throughout, the Ulster party has behaved like a tantrum-throwing toddler bent on mayhem. Despite being spoonfed huge dollops of cash, including £billion for Northern Ireland to prop up the Prime Minister, the DUP has never shown any gratitude.Instead, it acts with increasing recklessness, threatening to pull down the Governmentit does not get its way. The Conservatives should have never entered into any kind of alliance with the DUP.The bitter irony, however, is that through their recklessness the Democratic Unionists might soon achieve the very opposite of their goals.For one thing, by preventing May’s deal they could well destroy any chance of Brexit. They pose as Brexit battlers but are really Brexit blockers.Even worse for them, their antics could install a Labour Government under Jeremy Corbyn, who is a fanatical supporter of Irish unication.Corbyn in power would really be the end of the union and the DUP would have brought about that outcome.The party had better come to its senses —it still has any.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It will change everything.The first human transplant on human cadavers has been done.Everyone said it was impossible, but the surgery was successful.A full head swap between brain dead organ donors in the next stage.And that is the final step for the formal head transplant for a medical condition, which is imminent.Canaos plans to perform the first human op on Valery was dealt a blow, when the -year-old Russian announced last year he was no longer on board.He dropped out after his we gave birth to the couples miracle son.And Canao and Rens work has been met with harsh criticism by the scientic and medical community.Professor Jan Schnupp, from the University of Oxford, said the procedure conjures up gory, Frankenstein imagery, and described the proposals as disturbing.The chances that a person who has their head transplanted onto another body will be able to gain any control over it, or benefit from that grafted body are completely negligible, he added.The expected therapeutic value for the patient would be minimal, while the risks of graft rejection-related side effects, or simply death as a consequence of a mishap during the operation, are huge.Attempting such a thing given the current state of the art would be nothing short of criminal.As a neuroscientist, I would really like the general public to be reassured that neither I nor any of my colleagues think that beheading people for extremely long-shot experiments is acceptable.Dr James Fildes, of the University of Manchester, said the idea is morally wrong,the scientists cannot first prove the procedure improves the le of a large animal.Professor Catherina Becker, from the University of Edinburgh, said: Actual success of a head transplant must be measured by long term survival of head and body with the head controlling motor .This can obviously not be assessed in a corpse and for all we know, would also not occur in a living human."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000479317436.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"lidl car park bermuda triangle britain","story":"Dozens of customers found that theyve been unable to lock or open their cars using electronic fobs at a store in Gloucestershire.Locals believe that Internet-based traffic cameras in the car park are blocking signals - confusing motorists who were unable to get inside their vehicles.Retired policeman Graeme Wakerley, , noticed the problem while shopping.He was able to lock his car upon arrival but found his key fob wasnt working when he ed.The -year-old said: Its bizarre.

are still trying to find the time to book a haircut.And a whopping  per cent sometimes dont even have time to shower as they’re so busy running around after the children.Tan Kaur, digital pharmacist at Well Pharmacy said: “I have been working in pharmacy for many years and have often heard my customers say that even the simplest tasks can prove dficult when you have children.“Especially those with babies or toddlers, who can sometimes find hours mysteriously vanish when trying to do something like leave the house.“Our survey results found that lots of important tasks are unfortunately left on the back burner as parents have so much going on, and their kids come first before looking at their own problems.”The study also found more than eight in  mums admit to putting off le admin like sorting out car insurance or doctor’s visits because they’re too busy.Twenty-seven per cent haven’t had time to pay off a bill, and a third are still waiting to go to the dentist.Nearly half confessed

research, commissioned by Well Pharmacy which has launched a free NHS prescription service with the aim of taking the hassle out of prescriptions.Mums are normally roused from their slumber at :am, with eight in ten finding themselves exhausted by the time they finally go to bed at just :pm.And one in five mums get just  to  minutes of ‘down time’ in an average day, free to spend however they please.More than  per cent have also felt unwell but chosen to carry on with their normal family routine because they felt they ‘didn’t have time’ to be ill.The research also found the average Brit is putting off seven pieces of le admin, meaning nobody has a completely clean slate.Twenty-three per cent are still paying for subscriptions they haven’t found the time to cancel yet, despite being un-needed.And a quarter have got money or cheques sitting around their home that haven’t found their way to the bank due to a lack of time.Eight in  mums say the health and wellbeing of their children always come first and they therefore rarely think about their own health.More than six in  would rather put up with an illness than take time out of their day to go to the doctors or collect a prescription.And  per cent admit le would be so much easierthey could access everything they needed either online or via their mobile the phone.Tan added: “Of course, for all of us our family and children should come first when it comes to their wellbeing.“But these little pieces of le admin – going to the doctor, collecting prescriptions, booking a smear test or paying bills – are just as important when it comes to our lives running smoothly.Well Pharmacys online service is available on the web and via an IOS

She hinted at this, saying I fear we are reaching the limits of this process after the numbers were called out.On a day when Britains future hangs in the balance:Todays result will spark huge anger directed at all sides from the majority of the British public who just want to see the country exit the EU.The Government, hardline Remainers, Brexiteer rebels and the DUP will all be blamed for dooming the PMs deal to defeat three times over.It also raises questions about Mrs Mays own future - she vowed to quitthe deal passed, suggesting she will now try to stay in office even though her position could prove untenable, slamming the brakes on the jostling for her successor in the Tory party.A total of  MPs voted in favour of the deal, with  against -  Tory MPs rebelled along with the whole DUP, while just five Labour Brexiteers came round to Mrs Mays deal.After her defeat, Mrs May suggested she is considering calling a fresh General Election as the only way to break the deadlock.She blasted: I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this house.This house has rejected No Deal. It has rejected no Brexit. On Wednesday it rejected all the iations of the deal on the table.And today it has rejected approving the withdrawal agreement alone and continuing a process on the future.The PM said it was almost certain that Britain would end up taking part in Mays European Parliament elections - while Brussels bosses summoned EU leaders to an emergency summit on April  and warned No Deal is now a likely scenario.The Labour boss said: This deal now has to change. There has to be an alternative found. Andthe Prime Minister can’t accept that then she must go, not at an indeterminate date in the future but now.Leading Brexiteer Steve Baker raged: This must be the final defeat for Theresa May’s deal. It’s finished. And we must move on.“It has not passed. It will not pass. I regret to say it is time for Theresa May to follow through on her words and make way so that a new leader can deliver a withdrawal agreement which will be passed by Parliament.“This has been a tragic waste of time and energy for the country. We can waste no more.”On Monday, MPs will hold a second round of indicative votes designed to find a way forward on Brexit - with the most likely outcome set to be staying in the EU customs union.The PM could then make one final bid to get her deal passed, by pitting it against the winner of the indicative votes.Today loyal Tories hit out at rebels who doomed the withdrawal agreement by voting No.Michael Fabricant said: If Brexiteers think that a victory has been won, because Remainers and Labour voted down the deal, think again.On Monday, the Remainer Parliament will try to keep us in the customs union which means our obeying EU legislation and having no say in making them. Worse than before!Speaking minutes before the vote, Mrs May hit back at claims she should never have announced a third vote on the agreement because it was always doomed to failure.The PM told Parliament: Today should have been the day that the United Kingdom left the European Union.That were not leaving today is a matter of deep personal regret to me but I remain committed to the UK leaving the European Union.There are those who say youre probably going to lose today, so why bother  I bother because this is the last opportunity to guarantee Brexit.If we do not vote for this motion today, people will ask - why did you not vote for Brexit Mrs May concluded: When the ision bell rings, every one of us will have to look into our hearts and decide whats best for our constituents and for our country.Mrs May received a glimmer of hope this morning as a key group of Labour MPs hinted they could be won over at the last minute - while ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab also came on side.But in the end just five Labour figures voted for the deal, nowhere near enough to make up for the Tory and DUP holdouts.The DUPs deputy leader Nigel Dodds said after the vote that hed rather stay in the EU than risk weakening the Union.As the Commons debate started this morning, Boris Johnson confirmed he would vote for the deal despite denouncing it over and over again.He said: Today is the day we promised the country we would leave the European Union. I bitterly regret that we have failed to keep that promise. Instead we will today vote on the withdrawal agreement.I have been and remain intensely critical of the deal. But we have a choice to make now, and that means choosing between options that actually exist.I have come to the sad conclusion that neither this government nor this parliament is willing to leave with No Deal. We therefore run the risk of being forced to accept an even worse version of Brexit or losing Brexit altogether.It is very painful to vote for this deal. But I hope we can now work together to remedy its defects, avoid the backstop trap and strive to deliver the Brexit people voted for.He was joined in his support for todays motion by Dominic Raab, who quit as Brexit Secretary in protest at the deal last November.Mr Raab told Parliament this afternoon: I still believe it to be a bad deal. But we potentially now face an even worse alternative that could reverse Brexit and betray our democracy.Anger is not a political strategy - we must assess the specic and tangible decision before us.Opening the debate this morning, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox warned it was the last opportunity to secure the countrys exit from the EU.But the DUPs Sammy Wilson hit back, storming: Why would we vote today for a con trick that breaks up the United Kingdom Michael Howard, the ex-Tory leader and passionate Brexiteer, called on MPs to give in and back the PMs deal.He told LBC: We were told we were going to leave today, I wanted to leave today and I expected to leave today so this is a very sad day.If you weigh up the balance of risks, the least risky is her deal and I beg MPs to vote for it.The first meaningful vote was defeated by  votes in January, with the margin of defeat cut to  earlier this month.After the deal fell today, Remainer MPs will make a second bid to whip up a majority for a soft Brexit on Monday.Plans to keep Britain in the EU customs union failed by just six votes on Wednesday night.Rebel ringleaders believe they can get a majority of MPs behind the scheme in a second round of indicative votes next week."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463768715.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu boss taunts brexiteers with offer for britain to cancel our exit altogether on april 12","story":"The Commissions powerful Secretary-General said it would technically be possible for Theresa May to revoke Article  right up until the th hour on the final day were in the EU.And he hinted that on April  MPs would face another clf-edge, saying:  April is now the new  March.Last December the European Court of Justice said we can cancel Brexit and stay in the bloc without the permission of the EU.And today, after the PMs deal was slapped down by MPs yet again, Mr Selmayr took the opportunity to mock Brexiteers and say we still had the option.He tweeted this afternoon in response to a discussion about revoking Article : On  April, right before midnight #lastchance.The Eurocrat has previously declared that a No Deal Brexit is not the end of the world and insisted Europe shouldnt be worried by it.The EU now think that a No Deal is likely to happen after todays votes, and the pound took a plummet at the news.Michel Barnier insisted today that an extension for several months was also one of the options available to EU leadersthe UK agrees to their conditions.He added that the EU was open to work on the principle of a permanent Customs Union should the UK decide to take this path.A new Political Declaration containing Labours plan for future trade relations could be drawn up within  hoursMPs ask for it.Meanwhile, Donald Tusk announced an emergency summit will be held on April  as Poland backed a year-long extension in the hope MPs will use it to reverse Brexit.Britain will be presented with a stark choice of crashing out just two days later or swallowing a prolongation of at least six months.The EU Commission warned no deal was now a likely scenario and ruled out any sectoral mini-deals to help cushion the blow.It is believed the UK would have to table concrete proposals by April  to give leaders enough time to consider them.A spokesman said: No Deal on  April is now a likely scenario.

However, we have prepared for all scenarios.Mateusz Morawiecki said Brussels will offer Britain a long extension.Speaking after meeting with Michel Barnier in Warsaw, he revealed he has been trying to persuade the PM to hold a second referendum or revoke Article .He said: We are open to consider a motion to extend the process of Britains withdrawal from the EU by six, nine or  months.These options are all acceptable, because we want the UK to stay, andthat would not be possible to have an orderly Brexit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000475682320.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"is no deal brexit possible latest","story":"But it is still possible for a No Deal Brexit to happen - heres how.A No Deal departure from the European Union means leaving without formal arrangements for the future relationship or any transition period.Currently Britains trade, customs and immigration rules are tied up with the single market and a host of EU regulatory bodies.Ministers have been seeking a legal deal to replace these with looser arrangements so we are outside the single market and customs union but keeping close ties so cross-border trade is easy.Negotiations under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty led to the withdrawal agreement in November - but MPs rejected it in January.Theresa May headed to Brussels on February  with fresh plans to fix the hated Irish border backstop.And the PM also jetted to Strasbourg on the eve of her March  meaningful vote - which was rejected by MPs - in a bid to get further assurances from the EU.If Parliament cannot support a deal - and there is no extension - the UK will leave the bloc without a deal on March .That would mean the UK being treated as a third country by the EU with commerce governed by World Trade Organisation rules, experts say.Some Brexiteers say that could be positive - opening up trade with the rest of the world - but many people fear chaos.On January , Boris Johnson said that a No Deal Brexit is the closest to what people voted for in the referendum.He also urged Cabinet Ministers to mirror the British publics optimism and self-confidence for the possible exit scenario.A poll by YouGov on January  revealed that  per cent of the British public think a No Deal Brexit is likely,  per cent think a failed deal will result in a second referendum,  per cent said the deal will pass and  per cent said a better deal could be negotiated.The BBC said on March  that it understands that the UK doesnt intend to collect customs duties or have any other controls at the Irish border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Itll rely on self-reporting by firms instead.On March , Parliament dealt a major blow to Theresa May, resoundingly rejecting her improved Brexit deal just over a fortnight before the UK is due to leave the bloc.MPS rejected the PMs Brexit deal despite her assurance that new agreements reached with Jean-Claude Juncker in Strasbourg would ensure the UK cannot be trapped in the controversial backstop arrangement indefinitely.It means that Britain has been plunged into chaos -  days after the referendum, and with just  days before Brexit - as Brits are still in the dark about when, orwe will ever leave the EU.Following the March  vote, a spokesman for European Council president Donald Tusk said: On the EU side we have done all that is possible to reach an agreement.Given the additional assurances provided by the EU in December, January and yesterday, it is dficult to see what more we can do.If there is a solution to the current impasse it can only be found in London.On March , MPs dramatically rejected crashing out of the European Union without a deal at any time and under any circumstances.Politicians voted  to  to reject leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement.But, its not a legally-binding decision, and doesnt rule out the UK leaving the bloc.MPs voted to delay Brexit until at least June ,  days before Britain was set to leave the EU as scheduled.Now, Theresa May would have to head to Brussels and seek permission from EU officials.Butfor any reason they deny her plea, Britain may leave the EU without a deal.They will discuss the matter for the first time together at a summit in Brussels on March .An extension to Article  can only be granted by unanimity among the  EU member states, and Brussels has made clear they will do so onlythe UK presents a credible justication for being given more time.The European Commission has warned Parliament that voting against Brexit happening without a withdrawal deal in place isnt enough and that MPs must approve the deal, too.An official from the EUs executive branch said on March  that the bloc had already reached a orce deal with May, yet the House of Commons rejected it – twice.The PM said that politicians are at the point where they must approve a withdrawal agreement in the coming days and ask for a short postponement to Brexit day, or request a much longer extension from the EU to negotiate a new arrangement.EU chiefs have only agreed to delay Brexit as long as MPs approve of her deal or  the UK will have to leave with a No Deal on March .Jeremy Corbyn said The House has definitely ruled out no dealBrexiteers say it would be a boost for the UK to be free from Brussels rules and we will be able to strike deals with other upcoming nations around the globe.We would also not be obliged to pay the £billion orce bill, according to a House of Commons report — but Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked fury by saying we would pay up even without a deal.Many people fear the UK economy would be hurt by a clf edge Brexit as trade is held up by new border checks and tarfs and more red tape for businesses.Doom-monger Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned house prices could crash by a third in a worst-case scenario.Customs checks on cross-Channel freight could cause havoc at ports, hitting food supplies and other goods such a motor parts.The Border Force is also planning for a possible No Deal Brexit as they fear there will be signicant outbound queues at the Eurostar and a degradation of border security, Sky News reported.In a pure No Deal Brexit scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.The  mile frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic could become a hard border, according to Eurocrats in Brussels.The EUs rules may require Ireland to impose customs and other checks to protect the bloc’s border – which some say would mark ato the dark days of the Troubles.It could blow a hole in the Good Friday Agreement, with pressure on all sides to find a compromise.The Confederation of British Industry also said a No Deal Brexit would wipe £billion off the UK economy, making every region poorer, the Daily Mail reported.Ministers have previously announced plans for troops on the street and emergency ferries to cope with a No Deal Brexit.They will order businesses and families to start preparing for Britain to leave the EU without a deal and release £billion of extra spending.Ministers also unveiled the post-Brexit immigration system, which will end preferential treatment for EU migrants.Theresa May’s Government was plunged into utter disarray over Brexit just  hours before a crunch Cabinet meeting over Britain’s future.In December , Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted Britain could “flourish and prosper”it walks away from the EU with No Deal.As bitter Brexit battles raged on:Businesses received a -page document about Brexit, with a total of , firms likely to hear from the Government.The papers showed:"},{"url":null,"title":"anna soubry gets name party","story":"NewsAnna Soubry gets name of party wrong -

Theresa May is the sole architect of this mess, the grim assessment continued.It is her inability to engage in the most basic human interactions that brought us here. Cabinet has totally broken down. It came as Theresa May prepared to hold a third vote by MPs on her Brexit deal today - despite it being voted down twice before. Today is the PMaposs last chance to pass her -page Withdrawal Agreement, agreed back in November,she wants to lock in a short Brexit delay to May .  Otherwise there will be a clf-edge on April  where she must choose to crash out with no deal, revoke Article  or settle for a long extension. In a desperate bid to win Tory support, she promised to resign within weeksMPs pass her deal. Yet unlike the other two votes, todayaposs will not be a meaningful vote after Mrs May dropped half of her deal - the Political Declaration on future trade - from the motion put before MPs.This bid to win over wavering Labour MPs backfired as Jeremy Corbyn branded it a blindfold Brexit that he would not support.   And Mrs Mayaposs DUP allies - along with a hard core of Tory Brexiteers - warned they would still not support her deal. That leaves todayaposs .pm looking doomed to failure - and swinging the pendulum back to MPs, who will hold a second string of indicative votes on the way forward this Monday. But there is one glimmer of hope for the Prime Minister today after Labour MPs Lisa Nandy and Gareth Snell offered her a way to get her deal through. They tabled an amendment that would pass the withdrawal agreement -MPs get a greater say over the future relationship with the EU.

Just hours before we were meant to leave the EU, we still donapost know what kind of Brexit we will have, orit even happen at all. We are facing either crashing out with no deal or having a year-long delay while MPs thrash out a wildly dferent plan. And despite everything, including a promise to quitshe won today and hinting at a general election, Theresa May is limping on. Hereaposs what happens next after todayaposs carnage in Parliament.  MPs voted down Theresa Mayaposs deal for a third time - just hours before we were meant to leave the EU. The -page Withdrawal Agreement was previously defeated by  votes in January, then  votes earlier this month. This time, the desperate Prime Minister only put forward HALF her deal, and even promised to quitit passed, in a desperate last pitch to MPs. But it was still defeated by a margin of , including  Tory rebels who refused to switch and all  of her DUP allies. They were not swayed by Mrs May aposseparatingapos the Withdrawal Agreement from the Political Declaration on future trade, saying the second half could be voted on later. Labour warned it would be a blindfold Brexit. When will we leave the EU now   The EU was going to give the UK an extension until May  so that the government could get all the necessary arrangements in place. But that depended on Theresa May being able to get her Brexit deal through the Commons by pm tonight. So now we are on the EUaposs Plan B to Plan B - a clf-edge date of April . At that point Theresa May will have to choose between three options - cancelling Brexit, crashing out with no deal or a long delay.  Yes, weaposre afraid so. Despite losing for a third time she indicated that she did not believe her deal is dead, saying: This Government will continue to press the case for the orderly Brexit that the result of the referendum demands.  Downing Street sources today indicated they are likely to have yet another crack at putting the Prime Ministeraposs deal to MPs in a meaningful vote. Sources pointed out that her deal has nowgot more support than any of the rival aposindicative voteapos options that were put forward last week. Downing Street is braced for MPs to be presented with a straight choice between the PM’s deal in another meaningful vote - and whatever option MPs rally round on Monday night . The crunch choice could come on Wednesday.  Yes. The EU will hold an emergency summit on April  to thrash out the next steps. As hundreds of noisy pro-Brexit protesters blasted traitor MPs outside Parliament today, EU chiefs were reportedly drawing up a YEAR-long delay. Does this make soft Brexit more likely   Yes. MPs will hold a second round of indicative votes this coming Monday on what to do next. And on Wednesday, although there was no majority for any of eight options,all were what one could term soft Brexit.  The closest margin was for Ken Clarkeaposs motion which included a customs union for which  voted in favour and  voted against. We could end up having a long delay to Brexit to work one of these options out.  Yes. Plans for a confirmatory referendum - allowing the public to choose between the deal and Remain - got the highest backing of any of the  indicative votes. It got  in favour and  against. So this could march on further. In contrast no deal lost with  against and  in favour and managed no deal received  and  voted against. The race will now be on for MPs to seethere is a single option that they can coalesce behind. Does it make No Deal Brexit more likely   Yes. Theresa May told MPs today: The implications of the House’s decision are grave. The legal default now is that the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on  April. In just  days’ time. Stefaan De Rynck, a senior adviser to EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, said today: The no-deal today... is a likely scenario. Listening to what a number of MPs are saying in public broadcasts, or in interviews, it is really a likely scenario. Does it make a general election more likely   Yes. Theresa May hinted at a general election as she warned that we are reaching the limits of this process in this House. She said the defeat of her deal today should be a matter of profound regret to all members of this House. Many have interpreted that as a hint at a general election. Or, of course, it could be about MPs taking control and setting up a second referendum. Downing Street sources later played down her comment saying a general election was not in the national interest.  So which of these will actually happen  We donapost know. Sorry guys. Just two weeks to Brexit!

Sayeeda Warsi is understood to be in talks with the Equality and Human Rights Commission after dozens of members were accused of anti-Muslim rants and racism. An EHRC spokeswoman said: “We have received a complaint and will consider the issues raised.” It is not knownBaroness Warsi has made a full formal complaint, and the EHRC has not launched a formal investigation. However, it is understood that the peer raised the issue of Islamophobia with the watchdog and is in talks with EHRC chiefs.    The peer declined to comment when contacted by the Mirror. Baroness Warsi, the first Muslim woman to attend Cabinet and co-chair of the Tories under David Cameron, is a critic of the party’s alleged slow response to Islamophobia claims. Earlier this week she accused Tory chiefs of “revolving door racism” over reports  councillors suspended for alleged racism or Islamophobia had been reinstated.reported that one, Swale Borough Council leader Andrew Bowles, had his membership restored after he retweeted a post hailing far-right activist Tommy Robinson as a ‘patriot’. Mr Bowles later said he did not have any racist or Islamophobic views and “I wasn’t supporting him, I was supporting the process of free speech”.Theresa May was confronted this week at Prime Minister’s Questions by Labour MP Afzhal Khan, who accused her of being “in denial”. The Manchester Gorton MP claimed Tory chairman Brandon Lewis failed to reply to three letters he had sent on Islamophobia. He said: “The Conservative Party leadership are in denial about Islamophobia in their ranks and simply aren’t taking it seriously.” The Prime Minister told Mr Khan: “It is absolutely clear that discrimination or abuse or any kind is wrong. We take action where there are cases of discrimination or abuse. “He says we haven’t acted, I think, since  when he raised this issue. “We have acted on cases. Any allegations that are brought before the party, the party chairman takes very seriously and we will continue to do so.”  However, Muslim leaders have previously accused Tory chiefs of acting too slowly, or without full transparency. In one case reported by the Mirror, Medway councillor Michael Franklin retweeted a message that said Justin Trudeau was “worshipping the devil” in a mosque. His posts were raised with Medway’s council leader in February  but Mr Franklin was only expelled from the Tories last month. Mr Franklin said he regretted the “naive” posts and did not hold Islamophobic or racist views. Elsewhere the Muslim Council of Britain has accused the Conservatives of “trying to cover up” details of suspensions. Two dossiers compiled by online activists this month claimed to show  alleged members making offensive comments, including calling for Britain to “get rid of all mosques” and saying “it will be us whites who will suffer in years to come.” But Tory chiefs refused to say exactly how many had been identied as members and suspended. It comes weeks after the EHRC announced it was examining anti-Semitism in Labour, saying the party may have “unlawfully discriminated” against people due to their religion. A Conservative Party spokeswoman said: “We have not been contacted by the EHRC.” "},{"url":null,"title":"so brexit day what done","story":"NewsopinionSo, this is Brexit Day.

ButLeavers feel sad that they canapost celebrate today, then Remainers are equally unable to really find the fun in almost three years of epic cockaboutery.While Project Fear was derided before the referendum, the nation has now arrived at the point where a plague of frogs would be light relief from the omni-catastro-disaster-flump we find ourselves in. A nation where the architect of Windrush has been able to destroy our relationships with foreigners of all skin tones, BoJo has resigned over, declared dead, and then voted for a deal that his future leadership hopes are buttered upon, and Cameronaposs porcine relations are remembered with the same fond nostalgia as the smell of Grannyaposs Murray Mints.If voting for Brexit has achieved anything, it has been to alter our sense of time. In , two years seemed too long now it is not long enough. MPs wept that Big Ben must chime at pm on March  now, theyaposll be weeping when it doesnapost. And today the EUaposs alarm has gone off and weaposve willingly hit the snooze button just so we canto arguing about whataposll happenwe ever get our trousers on.This was the day from which we would be able to see the sunlit uplands. We would have played all the aces we held, be starting the easiest trade deal in history, and have our buccaneering boots on to bestride the world and paint it all pink again. Instead, other things are happening.... MPs are voting on whether to ignore themselves The Brexit hardliners are voting to support a deal they hate in order to re-activate a leaving date, and planning to later destroy the legislation it requires, so that we crash out of our EU treaties without a deal, a risk which Parliament has already declared it does not want to take, by  votes to .The Tory grassroots donapost want it the country doesnapost want it the Tory party doesnapost want it and business doesnapost want it. But a small group of MPs have decided they can ignore the will of the people on the grounds that itaposs the will of the people they do so. Way to go re-establishing Parliamentary sovereignty, lads. . We crashed the country and the compulsory excess is £billion Having opted to take off the EU-mandated seatbelt on the grounds it was too restrictive, added rocket fuel to the tank in the shape of lies, hopes and impossible promises, and then pointed the vehicle at an immovable deadline, weaposve whacked into it.Business investment has stalled. Employment is at record levels only because so are the numbers of self-employed, zero hours contracts and the  people who do more than one job. Absolutely nothing has been done or achieved - no fix for social care, no proper funding for schools, no plan for the NHS - save for dragging a further £.bn out of the pot and spending it on not planning for what to do when we donapost have a plan. On top of that, weaposre due to either a pay about £bn, after cashback, to be a member of the EU or b pay £bn extra to not be a member. There are people who will tell you straight-faced that option b is a good idea. . The hardliners are the softies The self-styled tough nuts have capitulated on everything. They complained about Theresaaposs red lines, then accepted them. They refused to pay the orce bill, then agreed it. David Davis expended vast energies on his irregular trips to Brussels for negotiations on demanding that the press conferences should be held in the UK offices, and each time acquiesced to holding them in the European Commission.Perhaps most suicidally of all, they demanded the Prime Minister trigger the Article  process. It was a gt to the EU, which wanted the same, and hamstrung the UK more effectively than anything  ever could. Having declared they were on the right side of history, they then rebranded themselves aposSpartansapos in honour of  Greeks who fought to the death at Thermopylae in one of humanityaposs most hopeless last stands. The Spartans went down fighting - this lot of wobbly-waisted weekend warriors ordered themselves into a cul-de-sac and started pulling out each otheraposs hair. . The IRA is back When letter bombs with Irish stamps were sent to airports, a station and a university earlier this month, the IRA claimed responsibility, using a codeword established during the Troubles. Not Son of IRA. Not the wannabe IRA, the IRA v., or the Snowflake Reboot of the IRA. TheACTUALIRA. Sources claim the IRA has been revisiting old arms dumps, the original bomb-makers have come out of retirement, and new members have been sworn in. Sinn Fein councillors refused to condemn a car bomb in Derry and, in , Northern Ireland had  terror attacks - almost half the EU total.And guess what - because Northern Ireland voted to Remain, they think theyaposre fighting for democracy. . The fascists are marching Eighty years after the Battle of Cable Street, there are men and women marching in the belief that their nation and race are under attack. Their charismatic leaders tell them a minority religion is a threat and democracy demands their voice be heard, even though those leaders couldnapost get directly elected by a confused squirrel. Today there are people stood outside Parliament demanding it NOT do what any dispassionate look at the evidence shows most people want it to. Most are confused, many ill-informed, and a hard core of neaposer-do-wells are riling them up with soundbites, livestreams and shouts of make Great Britain great again.Great Britain isnapost even a country. Theyaposre talking gibberish. But what makes it more sickening is they do it all draped in our flag. The flag which symbolises the benefits of peace and union between co-operating nations with common ideals and separate identities. If we hadnapost voted for Brexit, none of this would have happened. Senior members of the Tory party would not have likened themselves to the Grand Wizards of the Ku Klux Klan. People who were quite happy with things would not be called maniacs or moaners. No-one would be agitating for holy war in Belfast, scrabbling through the Parliamentary rulebook looking for loopholes, or lying about water cannon we donapost have. On the plus side, Brexit has destroyed Boris. Itaposs mangled all hope of Cameronaposs biography outselling Theresaaposs. And the Conservatives are going to be unelectable for a generation,only the Labour Party finds a way to dferentiate its coccyx from its cubital.Look around you, Leave voters. Look whoaposs stood amid the smoking ruins of your dreams, blaming someone . And Remainers, cast your eyes upon the thing that you once thought smelled a bit fy and has now had its entrails smeared across your doorstep. If they had told us all this would happen, it would have been called Project Bollocks. Now itaposs arrived, itaposs Project Blame It On The Dog And Run Away Before Something Worse Happens.Or as a Cabinet minister might put it: F*** knows.

His twin brother Harry sat in the audience, willing him on. He thought he knew Charlie aposlike his right armapos but could not see the demons he was battling buried deep beneath his confident facade. Just weeks before the show was broadcast, witty, handsome Charlie took his own le on March, , . He was -years-old.His devastated twin Harry, , established the Charlie Watkins Foundation after his only siblingaposs death to help young people suffering from mental illness.Talking to the Mirror two years after his twinaposs death, Harry said: I thought I knew what was going on in his head but I didnapost see the demons he was battling.    Now Iaposd give the rest of my le just to have one more beer with him. To tell him I love him. “Charlie loved every minute of Take Me Out. I watched it live in the studio. Before he came down the Love Lt my sibling rivalry made me hope that all the girls would turn off their lights but as soon as I saw him I was rooting for him. He was caught up in the moment as he came down the lt. You could tell he was a little bit nervous, buthe wasnapost nervous thereaposd be something wrong. Everyone was cheering, all the girls were shouting and dancing and loads of lights were left on for him.    I think he won everyone over with his big grin. But just weeks after filming the show Charlie tragically took his own le. Harry remembers: I saw him the day before his death. It was a Sunday afternoon, he came over to Leeds where I was in uni. We had drinks together and he was in really good form, outgoing and cracking jokes, all very quick-witted stuff. He had all my friends laughing and we were joking that he was the funnier brother. I never thought that what would happen in  hours could possibly happen.    He left at about pm or pm to go to a Lacrosse dinner. I gave him a hug and said aposI love you. See you soon.apos But that was the last time Harry saw his brother alive. Charlieaposs housemates became anxious when there was no response from his bedroom the next day and a former SAS member who he lived with unpicked the lock to his door and found Charlie dead in his room.  Harry said: His body was found on Monday evening in his bedroom. He hung himself.  I found out the next day.    It felt like I had lost my right arm. It was only at the inquest that I discovered the issues Charlie had around his mental health. It was a hard process, hearing details about your -year-old brotheraposs death that you didnapost ever want to hear. About one year before his death, I saw cuts on his arm. When I asked him what they were he got very defensive. It took me a while to realise what they were, that he was self-harming. But he started going to counselling and I thought he had gotten a lot better.    When we were in uni I saw him about once every three or four weeks, whenever I saw him he was in great form, like he was the day before he died. But I wasnapost with him  hours a day and itaposs hard to know how people are when theyaposre alone at night. Depression fluctuates. Someone may not be % depressed all of the time but they can still be suffering. Watching Charlie star in Take Me Out just three weeks after his death was an emotional experience for Harry. He said: “ITV sent a lovely box with photos of Charlie from the show after his death.  “They askedit was OK to broadcast the show and we thought that it would be a good way to raise awareness about mental health. Paddy McGuinness usually live tweets throughout the show but on the day it broadcast, he said that he wasnapost going to tweet that night because this show was in memory of Charlie, who lost his le since filming. I watched it up at uni with loads of my friends. We were like little kids glued to the TV. It was surreal but nice to see Charlie laughing.    He was in his truest form, cracking jokes. It was about three weeks after his death. It was very hard to see him there but also lovely in a way. Being twins, we were always going to be close. Charlie was  minutes older than me. He was an all-round great guy. We did everything together, we went to the same school, We had the same interests, had the same friends. “People said, apossurely youaposre not his twin brother, you look nothing alike. But it was nice to look dferent.    It was always just us two and dad. Our mum passed away from cancer when we were nine. When youaposre a twin you know when the other twin is annoyed or sad, but when we got older it became harder to tell. I always thought I knew what he was thinking but I obviously did not. Mental illness is not like a cut or a bruise or a break, itaposs invisible so itaposs hard to see that itaposs there. We set up the foundation to try to help other families. We donapost want other people to have to feel our pain, or to feel Charlieaposs pain of mental distress.    And we didnapost want Charlie to die in vain.  I never knew before his death that suicide is the biggest killer of young men. A lot of people are struggling.  We set up an online mental health service called Chat with Charlie which offers support for students between pm - pm when other support services have closed and before Nightline begins.  We want to help dispel the stigma and the myth that itapossapos aposweakapos to talk about mental health or feel depressed. Everyone deserves to be happy.   Charlie would probably take his hat off to ushe could see the work weaposve done in his name.”Visit the Charlie Watkins Foundation for more information or to donate to the charity.

I feel so guilty over something I cannot control.But I will fight to see as much as I can. My main aim is to see him go to school and for him to remember who I am and my voice. But I’ll always be with him in his heart.”    The symptoms did not show until Tyla, then  years old, was at  week pregnant. She suddenly felt sharp abdominal pain and had to take bath to relieve them. While in the bathtub, her hand seized up and a strange sensation travelled up her arm. She jumped out of the bath and screamed for her grandmother, but soon she blacked out. She was told she had suffered a seizure and was jerking about.    Tyla was taken to hospital where doctors performed a MRI scan on her. It revealed that there was a two centimetres mass growing at the left frontal lobe of her brain. She said she was told it was likely to be benign and thatit was cancerous she was likely to recover. In January , , she gave birth to her baby boy Preston a week early at the Royal Victoria Hospital. But a month into motherhood, Tyla became paralysed on one side after going out for a drink with her partner Mark.    Blaming the alcohol, Tyla ignored the symptoms for two days before she was persuaded to see her GP. She was taken to a hospital for further checkups. It was then she found out the devastating news that it was a grade-four glioblastoma - one of the most aggressive forms of brain tumour. She said it is nicknamed aposThe Terminatorapos because so few people survive longer than five years. Tyla underwent chemotherapy, brain surgery and radiotherapy but it would only destroy some cells but not all.    Tyla said she now wants to make the most of her time left with Preston. She said is going to start writing birthday cards soon so he can open them when she is gone. She is also saving things for him including locks of hair and a radiotherapy mask.

The outcome of that action can be disastrous. He added: I hope that people donapost make the same mistake that I made. Marlon is speaking out about the crash almost a year on as he continues to recover. Marlon was driving along Tayloraposs Avenue in Cleethorpes, about a mile from his home, when he dropped his e-cigarette at about pm on April  last year.    He was on his way to get some money for a concert featuring DJs in Liverpool that weekend. While travelling mph in a mph zone in his Mercedes-AMG C , he unbuckled his seat belt for just a few seconds, but the decision has changed his le - and the lives of those around him - forever. Marlon doesnapost remember anything about the crash and only knows the details thanks to police and witnesses. He said: The e-cigarette got caught between the seat and my door and I quickly undid my seat belt because I thought I could reach it really quick. While I was trying to reach it I had to look up and I had veered off my side of the road into oncoming traffic, and I was going towards an oncoming car.  I quickly grabbed my wheel and pulled it all the way down to avoid hitting this car, and my car was spinning. My caraposs rear end got hit by the oncoming car and that sent me through a bus stop. Marlon could have died at the scenenot for a hero who rushed out of their home after hearing the crash. The man cleared Marlonaposs airway and saved his le, his mum Helen said. She said of her son: He always wore his seat belt. Itaposs almost like a freak accident. Marlon was rushed to Hull Royal Infirmary with head injuries and two cracked ribs. His mum found out about the crash after seeing a post on Facebook , and went down to the scene where the police confirmed it was her son.Helen said: We were told they didn’t think he would live because of his injuries to his head. He was in an induced coma. We were told we had to think about possibly turning the le support machines off because he hadn’t moved and it didn’t look like he would. But the next day he flicked his finger and began to show there was le in there, which was amazing because I thought I would have to make the decision to possibly turn off the machine. From then on he began to move more.  Doctors performed a craniotomy, removing the front of Marlonaposs skull, due to swelling on his brain. He was without a full skull for eight months. Marlon, who worked as an electrician before the crash, relied on machines and tubes to breathe, eat and stay hydrated. His mum said: We would take his work drills and tools into his hospital room. Even though he wasn’t fully awake he would flick the switch on his drill, His eyes hadn’t opened and he would go backwards and forwards with his drill. We knew somebody was in there. Marlon emerged from a coma three weeks after the crash, and eventually started to smile and swallow as he showed signs of progress.  He spent seven weeks between hospitals in Hull and Grimsby before he was discharged on November , two days before his birthday. He now goes to MOTIONrehab, a private rehabilitation centre in Leeds, for four hours a day. Determined Marlon took his first steps in January and has been pushing himself as much as he can, surprising the staff. He said: They stood me up one day and said aposwe want to take one step forwardapos, and I was like aposone step  I’ll try and walk as much as I canapos, and I ended up walking with the aid of two physios. After I finished they said you completely destroyed the plans we have for you. He added: I have so much determination to eventually get back to where I was.  His speech has improved but it slower than it used to be, his memory is good, and he can now feed himself and grasp objects with his hands. Marlon hasnapost lost his sense of humour, and he has even joined a gym. He has a slight tremor in one of his arms and he has lost some of his vision in his left eye, but it is hoped that it willover time. For mum Helen, the experience has been the most horrendous thing she has ever been through. She has dedicated all of her time to caring for Marlon, who now lives at home again with his mum and stepdad Paul. Before the crash, Marlon was an independent, physically fit young electrician who owned his own home and car, travelled around the UK for work and went on beach holidays with his friends.  His mum said: Heaposs a gentle, lovely guy. It is an absolutely le-changing thing that has happened, going from independence to being fully reliant on others. Most of my time is spent with Marlon. I’m dedicating a couple of years of my le to get him as strong and as normal as possible. He had an amazing le before - a good job, his own home and friends. For this to happen is tragic. Marlonaposs prognosis looks positive, but because he suffered a traumatic brain injury there is still some uncertainty as to how far his recovery will progress. Mum-of-three Helen said: Heaposs coming along amazingly. He sets himself challenges every week, like doing more steps and things like that, to keep him going.  He doesnapost like sitting around much. They are pretty sure he is going to walk unaided, which is a massive thing. The problem with a brain injury is nobody ever knows or can predict what is going to happen. She added: Heaposs got a long way to go. He hopes to get back to work even in a couple years. We are going to do everything we can until he is perfect as possible. Marlon has been surrounded by a strong support network which includes his mum and his stepdad, his two younger sisters Samantha and Charlotte, and friends who visit him regularly. Marlon is keen to pursue a masteraposs degree in electrics during his recovery, and he wants to finally meet the man who saved his le in the moments after the crash. For now, however, that will have to wait. Marlon is putting it off until he can walk to the manaposs house on his own and shake his hand.

The explosion – exactly  years ago today – was heard as far away as Trafalgar Square, and officials in the nearby Ministry of Defence exclaimed: “That was a bomb!” Police found smoke pouring from the blazing wreck of a blue Vauxhall ­Cavalier, stalled half-way up the ramp from an underground car park. Inside was the blackened figure of a man, bleeding and unconscious, upright behind the steering wheel. He was unrecognisable, apart from the dark coat and striped trousers that were the dress of an old-fashioned Conservative Member of Parliament. It was Airey Neave, MP for Abingdon, war hero, Colditz escaper, Nuremberg prosecutor, secret service agent, proto-Europhile and the man who gave us Margaret Thatcher. His “psy-ops” campaign, drawing on intelligence experience, propelled her past hesitant rivals to the Tory Party leadership. On the eve of Thatcher’s general election launch, she had lost her most trusted adviser. The European project had lost a staunch supporter. Why     Neave, , was assassinated by a hit squad from the little-known Irish National Liberation Army, a splinter group from the moribund Official IRA. He was targeted because he was the Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, destined to make all-out war against terrorists in Ulster, where the Troubles had been raging for years. Four decades later no one has been convicted, jailed or even arrested for his murder. There was no White Paper on the affair, no public inquiry, no discreet briefing by spooks about the killers, beyond a forensic description of how they did it, with a mercury tilt-bomb of the kind frequently used by terrorists. Nor, beyond gushing obituaries, was there a rush to tell the story. Diana, his widow, put out to “the writing classes” the word that she did not want his biography to be written.  Obviously, I do not move in the same classes because no such prohibition reached me. So in the late s I began research on Public Servant, Secret Agent, The Elusive Le and Violent Death of Airey Neave, while working at Westminster as political commentator for the Daily Mirror. It was a complex, at times scary, inquiry. Let’s start at the beginning. Airey Middleton Sheffield Neave was born in London’s Knightsbridge, in , the son of a noted insect expert. One grandfather was Governor of the Bank of England. Young Airey was sent to prep schools and Eton, and went on to New College, Oxford to read law. He joined the Territorials while an undergraduate, enlisted in the Army at the outbreak of the Second World War, and was posted as a troop commander to France. Severely wounded and captured in the fall of Calais in , he was taken to Thorn PoW camp in Poland. He escaped, was recaptured and then sent to Oflag IVc, better known as Colditz. At his second attempt there, he escaped successfully, dressed as a German officer, with Dutch army officer Toni Luteyn, who spoke German well, unlike Neave. The pair travelled by train through Leipzig and Ulm before crossing the border, through thick snow, into neutral Switzerland. This remarkable effort made Neave something of a celebrity. Promoted in rank and into MI, covering escape and evasion from Occupied Europe, he was firmly inside military intelligence. He never really left. With the war over, Neave’s legal training took him to the Nuremberg Trials, where he read the indictments to Nazi top brass, most of whom went to the gallows.  Neave remained an officer in the TA SAS until the early s, when he realised his ambition of becoming a Conservative MP at a by-election in , beating Labour’s Ted Castle . He maintained close links with the security services, in dining groups in London clubs, and secretive groups of businessmen and old sweats who thought Britain was going to the dogs, or communism, which was worse. Neave was not a natural politician or speaker, more a conspirator behind the scenes. His brief, low-level ministerial career was cut short by a heart attack in , after which Ted Heath reportedly told him he was “finished”, making an enemy for le. When Heath lost a second general election in October , Neave became Thatcher’s campaign manager in the ensuing leadership contest. He treated it like a military operation – “psy-ops” – bamboozling fellow MPsinto believing she had no chance and they were voting for her to get better-known figures like William Whitelaw into the fray.    The Iron Lady’s Iron Man even persuaded Thatcher to make a pro-Europe statement to pick off Heath supporters. Supposedly the most sophisticated electorate imaginable, the MPs fell for his professional guile, and the victorious Maggie made him head of her private office. From there, it was an easy move to the job he coveted: Northern Ireland. Traditionally viewed as a political dead end, this was his chosen battlefield. Here, he could achieve his longstanding ambition to take on an enemy and win, through a combination of arms and military intelligence. The Provisional IRA and INLA feared him, in no small measure because Neave had been a PoW, like their “men behind the wire” in Long Kesh, who played a key role in the war against British troops. He understood their weaknesses, their way of thinking. He had to go. The soldier-politician knew he was in mortal danger, and almost how the hit would come.  “If they come for me, the one thing we can be sure of is they will not face me. They’re not soldier enough,” he told a friend. And that was how it was. The INLA, a small but vicious breakaway from the IRA, despatched “clean skins” – volunteers with no record – to do this one job. Thatcher was devastated by the killing, but soldiered on, quoting Neave: “There is work to be done.” Despite a hue and cry on both sides of the Irish Sea, intensive police inquiries failed to find the culprit. British police issued ious photofits of villanous-looking suspects. Some were taken into custody, and released. It was enough for one man to speak with an Irish accent and drink Guinness in the Westminster Arms to arouse suspicion. But the trail went cold, and then the serial murders of prominent republicans, leaders of the Irish Republican Socialist Party, the political wing of INLA, began. This was retribution. The first to die was John Turnley, a -year-old former British Army officer, gunned down by four members of the loyalist Ulster Defence Association who suspected he was INLA. One assassin, Robert McConnell, confessed in court to working with British intelligence. The next to die was Miriam Daly, , a former IRSP member, bound hand and foot and executed in her home by six bullets fired through a cushion. No one was arrested, though the UDA claimed responsibility for her murder. Victims three and four were key IRSP figure Ronnie Bunting, , and Noel Little, , shot by “cool and calm” gunmen wearing Army-style pullovers. Again, the UDA was suspected, “acting on intelligence provided”. Finally, there was a failed attempt to kill Bernadette McAliskey, later a Westminster MP. The plot was traced to another UDA unit linked to security services. The IRSP was convinced the Thatcher Government ordered these hits as revenge for Neave. Writing the Neave biography, I went looking for the assassins. Through research with contacts made covering the Troubles, I was directed to a hotel in Belfast, then ordered down to Cork. There, I was taken by carto a nondescript housing estate, where two men waited. One, rather ostentatiously, had a handgun on the settee, the other, in a ski mask, claimed to have been part of the plot. The killers, he disclosed, were a three-man team of “sleepers”, only marginally involved in Republicanism and unknown to the authorities.  The anonymous trio was drawn from north and south of the border. One was a college graduate, all were in their s. Armed with intelligence on Neave’s movements collected by a British sympathiser, they entered the UK via a third country, carrying ­explosives in a Perspex box. Contrary to colourful reports of breaching Westminster security, the bomb had been attached by a magnet, underneath the driver’s seat of Neave’s Cavalier, outside his home. It was a mercury-tilt device, primed to explode when the car went uphill. By the time it went off the bombers “were well gone” and ed to conventional lives in Ireland, according to the man in the mask. “Anonymity was the only safety they had, and that was the only reason they could live normal lives,” he said. If that is true, they would still be alive, pensioners well into their s. Airey Neave may largely be forgotten, but the circumstances that gave rise to his assassination are still with us, vividly manest in the Irish Backstop dispute. To update Thatcher, there is still work to be done, which is presumably why MI has  officers stationed in Belfast even today.

Cheryl Dodd, , had been told she would never be able to conceive naturally after being diagnosed at  with Polycystic Oy Syndrome [PCOS]. But incredibly, the part-time shop assistant went on to have five children with no medical assistance whatsoever. In fact, the single mum says she often laughs at the conversation sheaposd have with the doctor who told her she couldnapost have kids. The -year-old, from Telford, Shrops, is now proud parent to Harry, , Ellie-Jayne, , Annabelle, nine, Freddie, four, and Elizabeth-Ann, two. She said: When doctors told me I couldnapost have kids I was devastated - I always assumed Iaposd be a mum.    I was told it would be very unlikely for me to have children naturally and despite having the IVF option , it was still very unlikely. It was such a shock as Iaposd always thought Iaposd be fertile, just like my sister Freda. Eventually I thought aposthere are so many children in the world without parents who desperately need a loving, caring homeapos and decided I was going to adopt or foster one. So I was stunned to discover I was pregnant with Harry completely naturally. Despite everything Iaposd been told I was actually having my own baby, conceived with no tests and tablets - it just happened.    It was almost like once I relaxed and stopped thinking about it, my body kicked in.Now, I often think about going back to see the doctor who told me I couldnapost have kids originally with my brood of five. It would be funny.It turned out I was actually quite fertile.Every single day Iaposm more than grateful and honoured to have the opportunity to be a parent, and I am so happy to hear the word aposmumapos. Cheryl never had any symptoms of PCOS and saidit werenapost for an internal scan she would never have known she had the condition. Incredibly, when Cheryl became pregnant with eldest son Harry in  with ex-husband Neil, she didnapost even know she was pregnant as she had no symptoms at all. She had only taken a pregnancy test to provide moral support for her friend who thought she might be expecting, so was stunned to see the results.Cheryl went on to have Ellie-Jayne, , naturally the following year and Annabelle, nine, in  without any further issues.And it seemed as though Cheryl was destined to become a mum to many, as after getting together with new partner Gareth in  she got pregnant again with son Freddie, now four, and daughter Elizabeth-Ann, two. Cheryl said she did absolutely nothing special in order to conceive and continued her le as usual. But it wasnapost all plain sailing as she did suffer two miscarriages in  and had a severe haemorrhage and asthma attack.  The mum, who has been single again since , has now set up her own blog to encourage other parents who are struggling to conceive. She said: I always assumed Iaposd be a mum but I never thought Iaposd have a big family - I had never pictured myself as a mum of five. But now my family is complete and all my children are thriving. Harry is driven, he loves science and Iaposm sure he will change the world one day. Ellie is an artist, she is fantastic at writing and she wants to be an author. Annabelle is the performer, she is innocent, she sees hearts and rainbows everywhere. Freddie has the most vivid imagination and Bethy is our princess, she is spoiled by everyone. I love being a mum of five and wouldnapost change it for anything in the world.For more information check out mummyofmiracles"},{"url":null,"title":"my babys skin see through","story":"NewsMy babys skin was see-through, his eyes were fused shut - and I couldnt hold him, the one thing that I desperately wanted to doEXCLUSIVE: Cardf mum Katie Jones gave birth prematurely and spent months with her baby son Ray in neonatal intensive care , leaving her so traumatised she would break into uncontrollable sobs and wake up hallucinatingShare, leaving her so traumatised she would break into uncontrollable sobs and wake up hallucinating\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Katie-Jones.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\", leaving her so traumatised she would break into uncontrollable sobs and wake up hallucinating\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Katie-Jones.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\", leaving her so traumatised she would break into uncontrollable sobs and wake up hallucinating\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Katie-Jones.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\", leaving her so traumatised she would break into uncontrollable sobs and wake up hallucinating\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Katie-Jones.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\", leaving her so traumatised she would break into uncontrollable sobs and wake up hallucinating\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Katie-Jones.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\", leaving her so traumatised she would break into uncontrollable sobs and wake up hallucinating\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Katie-Jones.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\", leaving her so traumatised she would break into uncontrollable sobs and wake up hallucinating\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Katie-Jones.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"CommentsByChris kitching:,  MAR NewsRay was too small to comprehend, his mum Katie Jones says \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email My heart broke the first time I laid eyes on my tiny newborn son, Ray, as he lay hooked up to tubes in an incubator that was keeping him alive.He was too small to comprehend. His skin was see-through, his eyes were fused shut - and I couldnapost hold him, the one thing that I desperately wanted to do. I felt hopeless and I felt like he wouldnapost know who he was because it wasnapost me that he needed, it was the medical team. My heart was in bits, and that memory over a year on is still so raw. My husband Jonathan and I didnapost know what was in store for over the next three months in NICU - it was an experience that left us so traumatised I would sob uncontrollably in hospital corridors and I would wake up hallucinating.  Ray, our first child, was born  weeks early, at  weeksapos gestation, weighing just g on May , . He was immediately wheeled into the NICU at University Hospital of Wales in Cardf, and Jonathan and I embarked on a journey that would leave us broken. Before Ray was born, I went to the hospital four times over reduced movement in the womb - and on the fourth occasion they hooked me up to the monitor to hear Rayaposs heartbeat. I could hear his heart but I couldnapost feel him move. Every now and again there was a swoosh sound almost, but I just couldnapost feel the movement and I was made to feel that I should be feeling him move.  Earlier, the midwe had made a comment about how I may suffer anxiety and I should see my doctor due to the amount of times Iaposd visited for reduced movement. During the scan I got a bit emotional thinking maybe the midwe is right and I do have anxiety, so with that the midwe arranged a scan to reassure me all was OK for the following day. I told my husband not to come as itaposs just a check-up and the midwe was very reassuring and talking me through the scan, but then she just went quiet and said she was going to get another midwe to check something. My heart sank. I couldnapost help but think that Iaposve lost my baby. They turned to me and said the scan is picking up insufficient blood supply from the cord to the placenta and I would need to go up on the assessment unit for bed rest and be monitored for the next few weeks, but everything was OK.  I was given a private room and hooked up to a monitor, and I was told to lay on my side, but Rayaposs heartbeat kept disappearing. Within five to ten minutes a doctor came to see me, looked at the records from the machine and left. A midwe then came in and explained that I needed to go to delivery suite in a wheelchair, but I couldnapost quite understand why I was going up there. I was numb, on my own and scared. I was given a private room and then a surgeon came in and explained that Ray was getting distressed and he would be born in about two weeks before explaining the odds of survival and saying it would be best to get my baby to  weeks,possible.  Jonathan joined me and I was hooked up to a monitor, but within  minutes the doctor was back saying it looks like the baby will be delivered by the end of the week. Then within an hour she came back and said the baby is going to be delivered today and I was wheeled down to surgery for a C-section at .pm that night. I tried to remain strong and positive and not show my fear to my husband. I could see the fear on his face. When Ray arrived, there was no cry - the moment I dreamt about. We were told itaposs a boy, then the quietest of cries appeared all for a split second. I had a quick glimpse before he was taken down to the NICU. I was put in a delivery suite and a neonatal doctor came up and gave me a photo of our little boy, saying he weighed g and was currently on a ventilator but OK. My husband went to see him at am but I had to stay in bed due to the C-section.  I was told Iaposd need to try and express milk at this point. I was emotionally exhausted and felt I failed him. It was all my fault. I didnapost knowheaposd survive each hour. I finally managed to see Ray at am, almost  hours after he was born. Thataposs when I saw him in the incubator, although I could barely see him through the windows due to all the condensation from the heat keeping him warm. He had a cyst on the brain, oedema, chronic lung disease, a hernia, low iron and constant blood tests. It was really horrible to hear him let out a tiny cry when they took blood from him.. He required  blood transfusions, and regular ROPexaminations.  I was kept in for five days post-surgery and I was given my own room, but I could still hear all the mums bonding with their newborns, and the babiesapos cries through the night. But the moment I was discharged my world fell apart some more. I had dreamt of leaving the hospital as one happy family, beaming with pride and excited to start parenthood. This clearly wasnapost the case. On discharge I went to the NICU, said bye to Ray and Iaposll be back soon. I was scared something would happen to him when I was gone. We couldnapost cuddle him until he was a week old. It was only a couple of minutes. It was the moment Iaposd be longing for, just to touch him, smell him and feel his little fingers and toes.  Itaposs heartbreaking when they have to go back into the incubator as you donapost know when the next time you could get a cuddle. Walking through those hospital corridors, I cried uncontrollably. Jon and I travelled back and for every day, twice a day, not leaving until pm at least so we could be with Ray as much as possible. Jon had to go back to work after two weeks off, so Iaposd walk five miles to the hospital every morning and sit by Rayaposs incubator watching every beep, every moment from am to pm. Jon would pick me up, weaposd go home have a quick bite to eat, spend time with our dog and go back in for  or .pm till late. We did this every day for three months, even when I got poorly Iaposd visit him. I had my appendix out while he was in the unit and I still walked the corridors to be by his side. The pain I felt was nowhere near the way he felt. About , babies, or one in every , are born prematurelyin the UK every year, according to the charity Bliss. The earlier they are born, the more vulnerable they are because they havenapost fully developed in the womb Some may suffer from conditions such as behavioural dficulties, long term health problems or cerebral palsy as they develop into children and adults. Some research has found that the earlier a baby is born the higher their risk of having special educational needs at school, the charity said. It added: It is important to remember that every baby is dferent and will develop dferently. If you are worried about your baby’s development please speak to a health professional. We felt like the days merged into one and then it started to become normality. NICU was our second home. It was a traumatic experience and I started to suffer hallucinations and flashbacks. Iaposd hear the sound of the alarm monitors. Iaposd wake in the night to the sound of the oxygen tubes. Once, I thought my husband was laying on Rayaposs tube blocking the air flow, and I even woke up thinking there was all baby sick over me. When I hear the sounds of the hospital monitors I have flashbacks to the those moments where Ray needed help to breathe or a tap to get his heart rate back up. Every time the phone rang when we were at home Iaposd panic, thinking it was the unit calling. I constantly think about those babies who sadly didnapost make it. My heart breaks for those families.  Over a year on I couldnapost cope with the guilt of everything. I felt it was all my fault, that I put Ray through all that pain. In August  I finally spoke to my GP. There isnapost enough support for mums and dads who have been through what we have been through. The only support we had were the incredible nurses of NICU and our families. The nurses understood. We could laugh with them, cry with them, share our achievements and our not-so-good days. Questions need to be asked on discharge of how youaposre feeling, there should be leaflets on what emotions you can expect, and contact numbers for people you can speak to for help. There should be a review with a GP a few months after birth and mental health support from a health visitor when they visit you at home. If I could offer any advice to parents-to-be it is to please listen to your instincts. Donapost let anyone make you doubt yourself. If I didnapost have that scan I know Ray wouldnapost have made it. To those going through something similar, remain strong. Be there for each other even when days are hard. Itaposs an emotional roller coaster,youaposre not offered help then please ask for it.  I have been supported by the charity Bliss, which supports parents of premature and sick babies, and last year I ran the Cardf half marathon to raise money for the NICU team at the University Hospital of Wales where Ray spent his time. I will constantly give back to the team that saved Rayaposs le over those three months in hospital. The moment I walked into the NICU for the first time was a wave of emotion. It was a place I didnapost know existed - it was like a dferent and scary world. Alarms were going off, the nurses were really busy, parents were at their babiesapos bedsides and there was a row of incubators. Seeing Ray hooked up to machines and wires everywhere is something that will stay with me forever. Now almost two-years-old, he has fought so hard, although his immune system is weaker than a child born full term he is incredible and continues to fight off any infections that crop up. Ray has been back into hospital a few times with bronchiolitis and croup, and about four days before his first birthday he had an operation to remove the hernia. He is doing really well, we are back and forth with consultant check ups and the usual health checks but he doing amazing for his age and hitting his milestones for his corrected age. I don’t feel I’ll ever overcome the world of NICU. I now have anxiety. I have days where it all come flooding back, things we have seen that no parent should go through. I am emotionally scarred and so is my husband. I look at Ray and think how incredibly lucky we are but I can never get over what we through.

Traditional predictions are based on demographics - focused on age and gender. But by using machine-learning, the researchers were able to go into much great detail - even taking into account the amount of vegetables a person included in their diet in order to predict their mortality. The researchers say the study has the potential to be used to improve future health-care to prevent people dying young from chronic disease, like cancer.     The study, published in American tech and medicine journal PLOS ONE, looked at the health data of just over half a million people aged between - years. The participants were recruited into the study via the UK Biobank, Britainaposs long-term genetic health research resource. Traditionally, scientists have predicted early death using models based on age and gender, which is said to have a weak record of prediction mortality. The new study used AI machine learning models known as random forest and deep learning.      Previous research by the same Nottingham team found using the newer models more accurately predicted early death from cardiovascular disease than age-and-gender based algorithms medical experts currently use.Using computer machine-learning, the AI system was able to build upon the age-and-gender based predictions, by also exploring biometric, clinical and lestyle data. Just over , of the people in the study died during the research period between  and . The researchers were able to analyse those deaths using mortality data from the Office of National Statistics, the national cancer registry, and hospital episodes. When they compared the outcomes to the AI predictions, they found their models were  per cent accurate.    AI is being hailed as a potential lesaver in the field of medicine, as experts look for ways to help us live longer, healthier lives and prevent unnecessary illness. But critics fear the rise of Big Data in the health sector could lead to our health risks being used against us by the likes of  insurance companies - or, such as in the future imagined in Gattaca - our employers, and even prospective romantic partners. However the researchers predict future medicine will focus on tailoring health-care to inidual patients based on their personal risk profiles. The studyaposs lead researcher, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology and Data Science, Dr Stephen Weng, said the study could help fight early death from chronic disease. “Preventative healthcare is a growing priority in the fight against serious diseases so we have been working for a number of years to improve the accuracy of computerised health risk assessment in the general population, he said.Most applications focus on a single disease area but predicting death due to several dferent disease outcomes is highly complex, especially given environmental and inidual factors that may affect them. “We have taken a major step forward in this field by developing a unique and holistic approach to predicting a person’s risk of premature death by machine-learning. This uses computers to build new risk prediction models that take into account a wide range of demographic, biometric, clinical and lestyle factors for each inidual assessed, even their dietary consumption of fruit, vegetables and meat per day. The researchers say further study is required to explorethe predictions work in other population groups. They pointed out the UK Biobank tends to attract healthier volunteers from, educated, and wealthier backgrounds than the average Brit. The researchers say they hope their findings can be used to investigate ways to use what they have found in everyday health-care to prevent early death in the near future.

Emma Miles, , offered to be a surrogate for her daughter Tracey Smith, , who was worried she would never have a child of her own. Her kind mum stepped in and lost six stone in order to reach a healthy weight to get pregnant and give birth safely. And nine weeks ago she gave birth to a healthy baby girl called Evie. Now Tracey will be celebrating her first Motheraposs Day on Sunday with her baby girl, all thanks to her generous mum.    Tracey said: Every moment of heartache was so worth it just to have our little bundle in our arms. I am so grateful to mum for her amazing gt to us. Tracey found out she was missing her productive organs following a scan when she hadnapost started her period aged . Scans showed she had been born without a womb but she did have working oies and fallopian tubes. At  Tracey was diagnosed with MRKH- a condition that causes the vagina and uterus to be underdeveloped or absent, although external genitalia are normal.  Doctors told devastated Tracey that she would never carry her own child. At the time her mum Emma said she would do anything she could to help. But it was almost fteen years later when Tracey and her husband Adam, , were considering fertility treatment that they took Emma up on the offer. Nursery worker Tracey said: When I was diagnosed it tipped my world upside down. I was heartbroken at the idea that I wouldnapost carry my own child. Iaposd always known that I wanted to be a mum, even at . Straight after my diagnosis mum made an offer to do what she could to help. I knew that she meant one day sheaposd carry my child for me.  Over the years she mentioned it in passing but we never really made a firm plan. It was only after I met Adam and we got engaged in  that he broached the subject of children. Tracey and Adam considered using a surrogacy agency but were apprehensive because of the outdated laws around surrogacy in this country. Tracey explains: The law in this country gives the surrogate - and her husbandshe has one - all parental rights from birth and that felt like a huge risk. Instead Tracey asked supermarket worker Emmashe had been serious when she offered all those years ago. Tracey said: I remembered mumaposs promise to me.  So the next time we met up I asked hersheaposd been serious about carrying our baby. I was delighted when she replied: aposOf course I wasapos. She had just been waiting for me to ask. Traceyaposs dad Robert Miles, , was very supportive - and put it in writing through a solicitor that he and Emma would happily give parental rights to Adam and Tracey once the baby was born. Then Emma, of Lampeter, West Wales, lost six stone and took hormone tablets to prepare her body for the pregnancy. The IVF process involved taking an egg from Tracey and fertilising it with sperm in a laboratory - so it could be placed into Emmaaposs womb to grow and develop.  Against the odds, it was successful at the first attempt. And on January th  Evie Siân Emma Smith was born at lb oz by caesarean section after a routine pregnancy. Tracey, now living in Coventry, said: Adam and I were allowed to both stay by mumaposs side as Evie came into the world. It was such an incredible emotional moment. I was so nervous that everything would go well for mum and for the safe arrival of our baby.  Adam saw Evie come into the world because of a reflection on the lamps in surgery and I just waited to hear that cry and burst into happy tears. Now Adam and Tracey are going through the legal process of formally adopting Evie. Emma, who is also mum to Nicola, , said: To find out that Tracey couldnapost have children was gutting to me. She rarely felt able to open up but when I had the chance just after her diagnosis I remember sitting on her bed and saying: Iaposm hereyou need me.  Despite my age I wasnapost worried about giving birth at all. All of my focus has been about doing this special thing for my daughter. I donapost feel anymore attachment to Evie than any other proud grandmother. Tracey is my baby and I did it all for her to be a mother. Now Iaposm glad to be back to work and getting back to normal. But I have offered to do it all againthey ever want a little brother or sister for Evie.

It was horrendous. He said nothing and just stared at me while he squeezed his hands really tight around my neck. I was struggling to get him off and was pushing him, which awoke Francesco. He can normally sleep through anything and I remember him looking at me and then the bloke and then me again in disbelief.    When he noticed he had his hands around my throat he pushed him off. The man fell against the wall and walked out of our bedroom door. We heard him going down the stairs. He was stumbling. Francesco hurriedly put his clothes on and put the light on and by then he had gone. The victim says she immediately called the police, who have carried out a forensic examination of her home and ensured a police car was outside her address for a few days.  Jenner, who is a chef, added: I’m sure he would have left fingerprints and DNA as he did, as did not use gloves. I saw his face and his eyes were wide open and he looked like he was on something. I honestly thought I was going to die. Had Francesco not got him off me I would not be here as I would not have stood a chance because I couldn’t get him off. It’s weird as I’m quite a light sleeper but I didn’t hear a thing. At the moment I feel really angry he just came in my house and would do something like that. I’m a bit on edge but I just have to get on with it. The intruder was also not heard by Jenner’s flatmate, who was also sleeping at the time of the attack. Incredibly Jenner ed to work just five hours after her ordeal. She said: I had marks on neck and it’s still a bit puffy and tender now. The first few nights after it happened I could not sleep at all. I kept looking around to seehe was there and thought he would come back  Now we have a very good lock on our front door. I slept better last night as it just caught up with me.

But others disagree, writing: If these people formally sent you a message, I think they deserve a formal rejection as well. Not like this.  I do blog. I have a full time job, and I work hard to be able to travel so I can have content.

Tattoo artist, Ali Jones, , from Cape Town, South Africa, was good friends with -year-old refrigeration technician, Damian Grundy until one night they had their first kiss at a club and quickly fell in love. Already a mum of a little girl, Morgan, , from a previous relationship, as well as sharing custody of her daughter with her dad, Ali felt that Damian was also a good father-figure for her.Two years later, Damian proposed to her and they got married in  with their nearest and dearest around them. They had both tried for a baby but Ali miscarried twice before she gave birth to their son, Tziyon-Moon, in October .   Over the next two years Ali felt intense pressure over being a young mum striving to know who she was as a person and as an independent woman as her insecurities meant that their relationship started to suffer until they separated in . Shortly after they split up, Ali met another man, entrepreneur, Matty Ruchton, , who she hit it off with and they fell in love quickly. While they were not together, their marriage ended so amicably, that they continued to be friends. Ali encouraged Damian and Matty to meet each other as she felt they would get on. Over time, she felt she would compare her two relationships with each other and felt like her heart was split between the two, which negatively affected her relationship with Matty.    After feeling like her heart was in a constant apostug of warapos between the two men, her relationship with Matty ended after two years and she travelled to Europe. In that time, Matty and Damian had become extremely close, while bonding experiences and shared love of Ali, as well as having a lot in common. When she got back, they got back together and reminisced about the old days, then joked about having a threesome which soon became a reality. Despite Ali thinking it would be a one time thing, Matty and Damian both brought it up and they all decided to try being in a polyamorous trio.    They have been together ever since and they have felt stronger together as a new family. Damian and I fell in love nine years ago, we had been acquaintances for a few years during high school as we had the same friend circles, but the magic happened one night while we were each out on the town, Ali said. We shared our first kiss, Damian slept over that night and never left it was love at first sight and he told me he loved me after five days. I already had a daughter from a previous relationship when we met, she was just over a year when Damian came into our lives. After two years Damian proposed and in , we got married in front of thirty of our closest friends and family. Then two miscarriages later we fell pregnant again with our son in October .    Closer towards the end of  our relationship started to suffer, for the most part because I was unhappy with myself, still trying to find my path due to the after-effects of having my first child so young, I was a mum at nineteen. My relationship began to suffer due to my lack of self-worth. Very shortly after the end of our marriage, I met Matty. Who came in like a sparkling knight in shining armour. The way he made me feel and act was dferent to what Damian gave me. We also fell in love extremely quickly, he was exactly what I needed in my le. He also took on my kids as his own and loved them instantly. Obviously at first Damian wasnapost happy and was hurt that I had moved on so quickly.  But the incredibly strong inidual he is, and with the love he has for me, after a good while we all became friendly and we would all hang occasionally. I had always said thatthey ever got to know each other they would be great friends. A big problem with how I was feeling I was always comparing my relationship with Matty to that of my relationship with Damian. Obviously having been with someone for so long you get used to le that way and obviously le was dferent with Matty, still equally beautul but dferent. At the same time, I knew there was a part of me that wasnapost there with Damian. My heart was in constant tug of war between these two men I so clearly loved.  Fast forward about two years and Matty and I had broken up. I decided to go to Europe to kickstart my career and make some money. During that time Damian and Matty became extremely close, bonding over experiences and sharing and healing, I suppose. They had even apparently made a joke about the three of us being together. They became the truest, best friends, so similar and so dferent, equally such beautul souls. The joke became a reality once Ali arrived back from her trip to Europe and they ended up together. When I came back three months later the three of us decided to have an evening of catching up. Never in my wildest dreams did I think this night would change all our lives, she said.  We had some drinks, spoke about and shared our stories and experiences over the past few months, we each gained a lot of perspective, understanding, appreciation and healing that night. The day went on and we all started joking about a threesome - joking, joking, joking - until no one knewwe were joking anymore and then it happened, the most profound sharing of all our lives. It was so completely natural, like we had always just been that way. A complete sharing of the most rare and beautul unconditional love. When it ended, I thought it would always just be one magical night, but then the guys brought to the table that we could try this out, seeit works. It took some convincing, but I agreed to give it a try on condition that it doesnapost hurt anyone. The more time we spent together, the better and better things became.  I mean for the most part we all hang out as best friends, but the intimacy we all share together as well as myself with Matty and Damian inidually is so incredibly special. We are in a closed polyamorous relationship between the three of us. Which means that there are more than two people in our relationship, but it is not aposopenapos to sharing intimately or emotionally with other people outside of our triad. We all just balance each other out really well. We all add such dferent things to each otheraposs lives, so what I get from Damian I may not get from Matty and vice versa. The understanding and healing we have all gained through the experiences we have had on our journey together have set the most solid foundation to start a relationship on. There is literally nothing we canapost get through together. Our children are two happy, well adapted little humans. They are and always have been, no matter the situation, surrounded by the highest most unconditional love.  Polyamory is not about being sexually promiscuous. Though we share with each other sexually it is based on connection and the ultimate unconditional love. There are so many types of poly relationships. What we are doing is redefining what is seen as normal constructs of a relationship. Redefining what we were taught love is meant to be. Loving more than one person does not make the love you feel for one any less, as when you have a second child, your love multiplies. People will always judge, no matter what you do or who you are. We are happy, our children are happy. We love each other. Need there anything more  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.38862707-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.38862707-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.38862707-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.38862707-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"bumper support set to cheer on dundee in paisley","story":"Dundee will be cheered on by a bumper away support as the Dark Blues aim to kickstart their survival bid at relegation rivals St Mirren this weekend.By the start of this week, the Dens Park club had already sold their allocation of , tickets for the clash at the Simple Digital Arena. An additional  briefs have been sent of which only around  remain unsold.Dees were out in force the last time their side travelled to Paisley, though they’ll be hoping for better than the - reverse suffered after Sofien Moussa missed a penalty and keeper Jack Hamilton gted the home side the winner.There’s a new manager in the away dugout this time around, however, and Jim McIntyre has challenged his players to bring their “A game” to Paisley to take them a step closer to survival.A match this important brings its share of nerves from the players but the Dens gaffer insists that’s a good sign.He said: “I think you just have to trust in your work and hope the players understand what you are looking for going into the game.“Of course there will be nerves but nerves are a good thing – it’s good to have a bit of nerves going into a game like this.“From my point of view, it is all about making sure that the players know what is expected of them and what their jobs are. It is then up to the players to bring their A game and take it from there.”Last night, St Mirren slumped to a - defeat at St Johnstone to remain below the Dark Blues at the foot of the Premiership. Jim was at McDiarmid Park to cast an eye over Saturday’s opponents. He insists, though, that result has no bearing on the weekend clash.“Nothing changes but it is always good to get another look at them and see what they are doing.“Saturday is a huge game for both clubs and we know what’s at stake.“It is not going to decide anything because there will still be seven other crucial matches to play after that.”Dundee will have been out of action for almost two weeks by the time Saturday comes around and Jim is glad his players have had a chance to recharge the batteries.He added: “We gave the players a long weekend during the break because I think that is important at this stage of the season.“They are as fit as they are going to be so it was good mentally to get a wee break, knowing fine well what they are coming back to.“A little bit of down time doesn’t do anyone any harm.“Coming into three games in a week, three tough games, being rested up and ready mentally is just as important as physically.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.38862707-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.38862707-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.38862707-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.38862707-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"crocodile pictured in pond in arbroath shared widely on social media","story":"An Angus prankster fooled frightened locals after launching a crocodile head into a pond.Luckily for all those in Arbroath – as well as animal lovers everywhere – the lelike head was actually fake.Findlay Stephen has revealed that, since he pulled the stunt earlier this week, it has been seen and shared widely on social media with people all over Scotland reacting to the spoof.He said: “This was purely done as a laugh.“There is so much negativity on Facebook with people complaining about things that are wrong in Arbroath.“I’d got a plastic floating head and placed it in the ponds and took a couple of pictures.“I was going to do it as an April Fool, but thought it was too good not to put it up.”One social media user said the arrival of the crocodile might be Arbroath’s answer to the Loch Ness Monster.Findlay added: “As soon as it was posted it was widely shared.

confirmed he has opened deal talks with defender Dom Ball.The on-loan Rotherham stopper is out of contract at the Championship side at the end of the season.Ball, , will become a free agent in the summer and has indicated he would be open to signing on at the Dons.McInnes is keen to secure the long-term future of the versatile defender, who can also operate in midfield.Ball is coming to the end of a second season on loan at Pittodrie.The former England Under- cap has started the last six games for Aberdeen, including the Scottish Cup quarter-final win at Rangers.McInnes, whose side face Hearts tomorrow, said: “We have had an initial chat with Dom over the last few weeks about the potential of staying.“So we will see how things go with that. But there is nothing concrete on the matter.”Ball has operated at right-back following the absence of Shay Logan, who underwent surgery on an ankle injury.Logan has been out since the Scottish Cup fth-round tie with Queen of the South at Pittodrie on February , which the Reds won -.Right-back Logan will definitely miss the Scottish Cup semi-final against holders Celtic at Hampden on Sunday April .However, McInnes is confident he will be back for post-split Premiership games – and hopefully a cup final.McInnes said: “Shaleum is coming along all right.“He is also chirpy as anything, which is always positive, and he is responding well to treatment.“The Scottish Cup semi-final will come too quick for him – but he won’t be long after that.“The planeverything goes well he will be involved in the last few games after the split and hopefully a cup final as well at the end of the season.”Logan and winger Gary Mackay-Steven, who has an ankle problem, are set to be the only players ruled out of tomorrow’s trip to Tynecastle.Teenagers Lewis Ferguson, , and Connor McLennan, , both withdrew from the recent Scotland U training camp in Marbella due to injury.McLennan withdrew from the squad before they flew to Spain with a knee problem.Despite making the trip, Ferguson sat out the - draw with Mexico Us before flying back from the Scots camp early due to a thigh problem.However, both are set to be fit for tomorrow’s game.McInnes said: “As we stand I am expecting only Shaleum and Gary to be missing for Saturday at Hearts.”Defender Andy Considine is also set tohaving missed the recent - draw with Livingston with a calf injury.McInnes hopes the international break will have allowed on-loan Birmingham City attacker Greg Stewart time to recover from a hip complaint.He said: “Greg was another one for whom the international break came at the right time as we needed to give him a week to  days of rest.“Hopefully he will be okay for Saturday.“Andy missed the game with Livingston with a tight calf but he will thankfully be okay for the game at the weekend.”A number of Aberdeen first-team players played in the reserves’ - league win over Dundee on Tuesday – Stevie May, who scored, James Wilson, Stephen Gleeson, Mikey Devlin and recent signing Greg Halford.McInnes said: “We had a few boys play in the U game with Dundee and they came through that.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.42012279-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.42012279-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.42012279-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.42012279-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"authors fantasy novels return home to north east","story":"Books by a north-east author have made their way back home.Huntly-born George MacDonald, who was known for his work in the fantasy genre, was cited as having an influence on Lord of the Rings author, JRR Tolkien, and was a mentor to Alice in Wonderland writer Lewis Carroll.A selection of novels by Mr MacDonald, who died in , are being donated to Aberdeenshire Council’s library and information services in Oldmeldrum today.The books have been donated by Clive Millar, who received the items after his grandmother Jean Millar passed away.Her father John MacNairn was a contemporary of Mr MacDonald, and introduced her to his work which led to her collecting a number of his novels.Included in the collection is the Diary of an Old Soul which was privately printed for the author in  and is signed by him."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/5c9de581d25866.68860397.jpg ","title":"calls for public inquiry into north sea helicopter safety","story":"Calls have been made to hold a public inquiry into helicopter safety in the North Sea, on the approach to the tenth anniversary of the Super Puma crash off the north-east coast.North East Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald has called on Scottish Ministers to back the probe.He asked the Scottish Government to back the offshore workforce and trade unions for the inquiry  years after the fatal helicopter crash near Peterhead.All  passengers and two crew on the Bond Offshore helicopter flight N lost their lives in the disaster on April , .Mr Macdonald had quizzed Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, Paul Wheelhouse, raising the issue during General Questions at the Scottish Parliament yesterday.He said in Parliament: “Since that disaster  years ago, another four offshore workers lost their lives off Shetland in  and  lives were lost in the Norwegian sector in .“The fatal accident inquiry on the Peterhead crash found it was preventable and, much at the same time, the transport select committee at the House of Commons acknowledged the case for a public inquiry looking at the commercial pressures which effect helicopter operations.“The view of the offshore workers, trade unions and many families is very clear, will the Scottish Government not get behind calls for a full public inquiry before any more lives are lost offshore ”Speaking in response to the Labour MSP, Mr Wheelhouse said: “April  marks  years since the Super Puma disaster off the coast of Peterhead with the loss of  lives. Our thoughts are with those who lost love ones in the tragedy.“A range of work has been undertaken by the civil aviation authority , trade unions and the industry in developing safety measures.“We will continue to raise and prioritise the issue of health and safety in the industry. It is not that we are ignoring the issue, far from it, we are taking it very seriously.”Mr Macdonald said following the meeting: “The Scottish Government will not back a public inquiry into helicopter safety because they claim that industry-led reviews are adequate.“Offshore trade unions know the only way to reduce the risk to their members and all offshore workers is to hold a comprehensive inquiry, which will include evidence from the workforce, into all aspects of helicopter transportation in the North Sea.“There is a strong case for a public inquiry to ensure helicopter journeys in the North Sea are as safe as possible and we will not stop making that case to the Scottish and UK Governments.

The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 12","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPIC:This beautul sunset across Loch Etive at Connel was taken with a mobile phone by Fiona McCuish from Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"ardrishaigs spirits get a kelpie boost","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrivers were visibly doing a #double-take# driving through Ardrishaig.More used to seeing serried ranks of Sitka spruce piled at the harbour ready for loading on to cargo ships, motorists were instead treated to the majestic sight of two mini-Kelpies glimmering in the pierhead sunshine.A smaller-scale version of the iconic -metre high Kelpies sculpture which sit beside the Forth and Clyde Canal near Falkirk, the three-metre-tall #macquettes# were in fact used as a basis for the world-famous sculpture.The mini Kelpies arrived in Ardrishaig on the afternoon of Thursday March , sparking a mini social media storm in the Loch Fyne-side village.Their visit coincides with something of a revival in Ardrishaig, with the Scottish Canals-led regeneration of the former Gleaner and neighbouring sites to create a heritage hub due to open this summer."},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"campaigners form save ayr town","story":"NewsCampaigners form to save Ayr town centreAnd history will play a part in creating a vibrant futureShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pressure group sparked in the wake of the axing of the Ayr Renaissance Group is shaping a new plan for the dying town. The -strong #AyrDeservesBetter are a think tank of Ayr partisans - and they’ve delved into the past to come up with a future. A key plank is to rip-up the dated one-way system and construct a new inner ring road circling the historic centre. That involves re-using the old rail bridge across the River Ayr and incorporating Miller Road. Their new plan - called The Bruce - is in its infancy. The Bruce Plan has drawn ideas from a  map of the town centre.The #ADB advocates the entire bottom end of the High Street no longer being a shopping area, and all businesses relocated towards the top of the town. Spokesman Pat Lorimer revealed: “We looked at what was special on the  map then we added in the favourite shops, bars, cafes and walking routes. “You could argue  was the heyday of Ayr.” Though the Bruce Plan will not be published for several weeks, we can reveal a new traffic plan is a priority to replace the present shambolic system that confuses visitors. The new inner ring road system would not involve Sandgate at all. Pat said: “The current system was developed piecemeal without a master plan, that is why it is so hopeless. “When visitors come to town by car they actually have no idea where they are within Ayr because of the confusing road.” Seven piers of the old fishmarket railway bridge still exist and could provide the support for a new structure. The metal bridge was finally removed in , long after the single track rail had been pulled-up. The Bruce Plan is named after King Robert the Bruce who burned the English troops out of Ayr. The Ayrshire Post revealed last week there are  empty shops and buildings in the town centre area. The river end of the High Street would be completely given over to leisure and heritage. The council has already advocated demolishing the Citadel pool and sports hall and creating a new one at the Kyle Centre. Retired architect Pat revealed the group were “trying to run with” and help South Ayrshire Council rather than be against them. That’s despite the view the council has a poor executive compared to the way East and North are run. However, unlike Ayr Renaissance - which had a £,-a-year chief executive -they won’t be funded by the council. Pat said: “There is a great future for Ayr and we need to find it. “We need action, not another consultant’s paid for report and more talk.“We are a pressure group of like-minded people who all want to help Ayr.” Already signed up as members are Ronald Alexander, Toria Cassidy, Michael G Clark, Rob Close, Kirsty Darwent, Michael Davis, Peter de Moncey-Conegliano, David Dickson, Allan Dorans, Chris Fremantle, Christine Fremantle, Lianne Hackett, Nigel Hackett, Ali Logan, Patrick Lorimer, Andy McAvoy, Ian McKinnell,Norman McLean, Angela McNay, Alistair Paterson, Gordon Smith and Fiona Walker.

The deal Clic Sargent struck to sell the land and buildings to McCarthy and Stone hinged on planning permission being granted and the Prestwick development going ahead. But, with last week’s bombshell news that McCarthy and Stone pulled the plug on the project, the charity is stuck with a £.m white elephant. Clic Sargent agreed to sell the buildings and land in  and struck a £.m agreement with McCarthy  Stone. But when the developers unveiled their luxury flat plans they became embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work had to stop. And last week the developers announced they had pulled the plug on the project. Now it has emerged the entire deal was conditional on planning permission being granted and the development going ahead. Kevin O’Brien from Clic Sargent said: “We are hugely disappointed that the sale hasn’t gone ahead as we’d hoped. “Every day that this building sits empty it not only impacts on the people of Prestwick. It means that we are not able to provide vital support for all the children with cancer in Scotland who desperately need us. “Selling Malcolm Sargent House was a really dficult decision because we are extremely proud of its history and the role it played in the local community.” He added: “We continue to seek a buyer so that we can use this money to pay for vital services like our social workers and Homes from Home, which provide an essential leline for families when they hear the devastating news that their child has cancer.” Prestwick councillor Hugh Hunter said: “We now have a site that’s going to lie empty and Clic Sargent have no idea what they are going to do with it. “They also have a £.m black hole in their books. “It’s been a shambles.” In  a petition to save Malcolm Sargent House received nearly , signatures in just a week.

Now Robert Dunlop has gained a criminal conviction for terrorising the people of Troon. The former Troon butcher, who turns  on April Fool’s Day, waged a letter vendetta against seven members of Troon Community Council. This reduced some community councillors to tears and one woman was so terried she now has a police panic alarm. Dunlop, of A Barassie Street, Troon, was found guilty on Friday by Sherf Scott Pattison of causing fear and alarm but not guilty of having a lock kne in Dundonald Road. His partner Krystyna Domanska, , was also on trial but was cleared of any involvement. Both had denied conducting the campaign between October  and September . Dunlop escaped with a slap on the wrist and has been warned to be of good behaviour for the next six months. His bail conditions banning him from approaching any of the community councillors will remain in place. This week a Troon Community Council spokesperson said: “We are very unhappy at the sentence but glad this man is now a convicted criminal. “He upset so many lovely volunteers in Troon and put us through the ordeal of having to give evidence in court. “It has been a very stressful time and we are all delighted this is now over.” Dozens of threatening letters were delivered to the home addresses of the community councillors. It was sparked when Dunlop lost the plot with the then South Ayrshire councillor Nan McFarlane, who had tried to help him in a benefits issue. The letters claimed the community councillors were involved in corruption, fraud and assault. Dunlop threatened to inform the public of this and claimed he was entitled to “bear arms and inflict violence”. The Ayrshire Post also received a nine-page letter, quoting an ancient Roman law called the Augustine Petition as the basis for the hostility. One y diatribe claimed all  South Ayrshire councillors were corrupt without providing any evidence. Other letters were despatched to South Ayrshire’s chief executive, legal head Ralph Riddiough, Troon police and the chief constable. Churches were also sent letters in a bid to blacken the names of citizens. Dunlop and Domanska made national headlines five years ago when the French village they were living in turned against them. They were accused of being neighbours from hell after building a wall, preventing the popular couple next door using their front door and nailing down their window shutters. The village mayor said the neighbours had been “terrorised” and Dunlop sent a -page letter to the French justice minister and an -page epic to then president Nicolas Sarkozy.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonScotlands CommunityAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thieving girvan florist ordered cough","story":"NewsThieving Girvan florist ordered to cough upLaurenson was lucky to escape jail when sentenced at Ayr Sherf Court in February .ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsAnnabel Laurenson appeared at Ayr Sherf Court\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA thieving florist has made just one repayment on £ compensation ordered by a court, writes Edwin Lawrence. That was for £ - and was made over a year ago, Ayr Sherf Court heard. Yet social media pages during that time show Annabel Laurenson on days out all over south-west Scotland. They also show a new family car and pay-to-view sports channels in her family home. Laurenson was lucky to escape jail when sentenced at Ayr Sherf Court in February . She admitted stealing from the Nicola Jayne Flowers business in Girvan on dates between January ,  and December , . Laurenson was ordered to complete  hours of unpaid work, and to pay back £ in compensation to her former bosses. The total value of cash and goods she stole was estimated at much more than this figure.    And the hurt and distress caused to her former employers, who were also her friends, can’t be quantied. Defence lawyer John Gallagher last week told Ayr Sherf Court that Laurenson, , had completed her unpaid work. But he admitted the only repayment she has made was the £ she turned up at court with - on the day of her sentence in February last year. Mr Gallagher claimed Laurenson, of Girvan’s Maxwell Street, had hoped to secure a loan from her father. But he died in November, and the costs of his care and his funeral made this impossible. “She is unemployed, but her husband is in work, and she is well aware this has to be repaid,” said Mr Gallagher. The lawyer said the remainder of Laurenson’s father’s estate would have to be shared with her mother and siblings. “How much is she likely to inherit ” asked Sherf John Montgomery. “I’m not sure,” said Mr Gallagher. “But not enough to pay this back.”    “The time for repayment has lapsed,” said Sherf Montgomery bluntly. Mr Gallagher insisted that Laurenson was anxious to pay the outstanding £. He asked the sherf to revoke the original payback order, and instruct a new compensation order. Mr Gallagher said Laurenson could pay £ per month, and Sherf Montgomery agreed to the request. Laurenson had worked at the popular Dalyrmple Street business for many years, and was a trusted member of staff. Shop owner Nicola Jayne Purdie said she was ‘devastated’ to find out her colleague and friend was ripping her off. She said at the time of last year’s sentence: “She stole a substantial amount of money and stock. There has been absolutely no remorse. She hasn’t said sorry. I feel betrayed. This is a family business and we were working together for  years.”Nicola Jayne said the theft came to light after she noticed discrepancies within the business. Laurenson who shared family occasions with the Purdies, including parties, weddings and funerals, offered no explanation for her behaviour.

In the event ScotRail does not achieve improved performance or fails to deliver on its contractual commitments, it does of course run the risk of having the franchise terminated early.Tory MSP Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, read a letter from a constituent who said they were ldquogenuinely surprised when the Borders service was on time, and problems caused ldquosignicant stress and anxiety because of lateness at work and fines for collecting their child from nursery.She said hundreds of commuters were ldquoexperiencing transport hell and urged Ms Sturgeon to intervene and personally oversee the remedial plan.However, Ms Sturgeon made it clear she would not intervene.She said: ldquoThe transport secretary will oversee that, because it is part of his responsibilities. However, as First Minister, I, too, will obviously retain a very close interest in the matter.A ScotRail spokesperson said: ldquoEveryone at ScotRail is working flat out to deliver the quality of service that our customers expect and deserve.ldquoOur most recent period of performance is also very encouraging and shows that the investment we are making in Scotlandrsquos Railway is delivering signicant improvements.ldquoWe know there are still areas where we need to improve and we will work closely with Transport Scotland to deliver those improvements."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrity-support-for-25th-borders-walking-festival","story":"TICKETS for the th Scottish Borders Walking Festival, a week-long event held in Selkirk and the Ettrick and Yarrow valleys from September , are set to go on sale later this month ndash and a famous face has signed on to lend support.This yearrsquos event will be kicked off by one of Scotlandrsquos top outdoor writers, and presenter of the BBC Adventure Show, Cameron McNeish.McNeish, who will appear at the festivalrsquos opening night celebrations, was editor of The Great Outdoors magazine for twenty years and still writes regular columns in Scots Magazine, Campervan Magazine, the Herald and for online magazine www.walkhighlands.His most recent best-selling book, Therersquos Always the Hills, with foreword written by Sam Heughan, star of Outlander and a walking enthusiast, won the  lsquoThe Great Outdoorsrsquo Magazine Book of the Year award.Cameron will be giving a presentation on his book with a signing afterwards, while the evening will also see music from local performers Selkirk Silver Band and the Clarsach Duo, Madalaine Cross and Charlotte Tuckwood.This yearrsquos festival will see a total of  guided countryside walks of ied s, taking in routes across the Selkirk, Ettrick and Yarrow Valley areas -

Deloris is a Philadelphia lounge singer who dreams of stardom, but when she witnesses her lover-turned-gangster shoot one of his mob, she flees into the arms of good guy cop lsquoSweaty Eddiersquo .Delorisrsquo world is turned upside down when she is placed under witness protection in a rundown convent, disguised as nun Sister Mary Clarence.Although the adaptation does not feature songs from the original film, the musical repertoire is erse and magical.When we first catch a glimpse of the nuns, as they meander across the stage squawking like a bunch of demented penguins, I grimace. They are so out of tune I pray I donrsquot hear that god awful sound again.Upon learning that Deloris will be joining the convent, Mother Superior, played by Pam Graham, prays: ldquoDear Lordthis is a test, I cannot fail with you by my side. May she be of faith, of modestyhellip But she is stopped in her tracks by the voice of a brash American Deloris.Mother Superior continues: ldquoPerhaps the choir of angels drowned me out and you didnrsquot hear me Lord.Pam plays the exasperated Mother Superior prissy and clipped, with subtle comedy delivered in perfect tone.Of course things donrsquot run smoothly for the ghetto-fabulous a-turned-nun as you probably can imagine. It isnrsquot long before Deloris ruffles Mother Superiorrsquos habit and puts the nuns in danger, which leads to Deloris being given just one simple activity, joining the choir.Can she really unleash the songbirds trapped inside these nuns  This is when the show steps up a notch, and, although all dressed in habits, the audience can start to identy with the lead characters.In steps jolly Sister Mary Patrick, played by the enigmatic Claire Bell, along with Sister Mary Robertas the timid church mouse, and deadpan choir director Sister Mary Lazaruswho fully captured the gravelly voiced cantankerous nun. Her reprisal of the screen character is uncanny and garners lots of laughs from the audience.When the large ensemble of nuns gathered together, I did feel a sense of sisterhood and that they were each playing dferent characters despite having a minor role or no dialogue. Their pitch perfect delivery of lsquoRaise Your Voicersquo and lsquoTake Me To Heavenrsquo would draw the crowds into any church Irsquom sure.Playing the leading lady is no easy task, but in scene after scene Nicola embraces Deloris and puts her own sass and ghetto style into the character, belting out powerful tunes. To sum up her performance, what better words to use than those of Deloris Van Cartier herself ndash shersquos lsquoFabulous Babyrsquo!The last time I saw Lizzie Bell she was stumbling about drunk and shouting at a group of young kids, so I was shocked to see her convert to a Catholic nun. Of course, Lizzie was in character then as the vile orphanage boss Miss Hannigan, for Annie, performed by the Kids Innerleithen Theatre in November last year. The young actress shows true ersity, by portraying the meek Sister Mary Roberts with an enchanting solo performance.Although the female performances were powerful, they did not overshadow the male cast. Roger Brydon, Stewart Wilson and Colin Tweedie had me in tears as bumbling henchmen Joey, TJ and Pablo. Their comical performance of lsquoLady In The Long Black Dressrsquo didnrsquot leave females in the audience weak at the knees, but it did conjure up a few belly laughs!David Paterson was cast as Curtis who played the mob boss brilliantly, dominating the stage fiercely. And mild mannered officer Eddie Souterwho gave a cracking solo, proves he lsquoCould Be That Guyrsquo going from lsquoSweaty Eddiersquo to lsquoCool Copper, saving Deloris and winning her heart. A special mention to Jamie McCubbin, as the Irish Monsignor OrsquoHara ndashI closed my eyes Irsquod swear it was Father Ted!Needless to say the cast were at the top of their game, but anyone going to the show will no doubt be dazzled by the glitzy backdrop and detailed stained glass art of the fictional Catholic church.

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will

The wood surrounds a lake of the same name, which is actually a reservoir created  years ago.Pressmennan Lake is nearly km long and meanders through the wood, giving the appearance of a river rather than a loch. In summer, the lush canopy of trees which surround the lake can engulf the senses, and for a moment you can be fooled into thinking you are in the middle of an ancient forest.And in a sense, you are. The wood is a fragmentary remnant of the ancient oak wood which once covered most of our county. Records show it existed in medieval times, and Irsquom sure well before that.Much of it was felled, so tradition tells us, when the warship The Great Michael was built on the order of James IV around . This ship was famously constructed using the oak woods of Fe, but such was the size of the vessel that wood from where was also needed, including Pressmennan.Yet the wood seems to have survived, and in  the felling of trees here is said to have been stopped due to its importance as a habitat for the kingrsquos deer.It remains a place rich in wildle. Roe deer still roam free amidst the trees here. They are creatures of woodland magic, and native to these isles. They are small and nimble-footed, and will dart into the undergrowth at the sight or sound of approaching danger. They have short antlers and a tailless rear, which usually has a white patch. This is the part of the animal you most likely see, as it quickly bounds away from you.The wood is full of other wildle: owls and bats, hares and foxes, stoats and weasels, and, according to the Woodland Trust Scotland, who own and care for the wood, otters have also been seen in the lake. The birdle here is likewise rich, and there is a crescendo of song in the spring. The trust acquired the wood in  and is slowly restoring it to its natural character, planting oak and other native trees.We arrived at the wood last weekend, on a day of changeable weather, but laden with the promise of spring. There is a childrenrsquos map provided by the Woodland Trust and it proved a great hit for my kids, who followed the loch-side path looking for the features identied.These are wood carvings and sculptures made by artist Robin Wood. Part of the trail includes doors and windows in the trees which are said to be the homes of magical creatures called the Tootflits and Glingbobs.My children, well-versed in the folklore traditions of our county, know all about faeries, brownies, selkies, kelpies, witches and wizards. But Tootflits and Glingbobs were new to them, and to be honest myself as well.They are mythical creatures created by the artist and trust to provide a sense of wonder and adventure for children as they explore the wood. You can search for their homes and the wood sculptures along the way.And so we set off on our adventure of discovery. The path by the riverbank needs care with wee ones when wet, but it whispers magic. Ancient oak trees line the banks of the lake, their branches dipping into the water.These old trees were still leafless, biding their time for the arrival of spring proper. But they were a spine-tingling sight, a reminder of what once was here in abundance. But then, as we ventured deeper into the wood, we made a less pleasant discovery.Some people had decided it was a good idea to hammer coins into the sculptures, and even into the living trees. We found the homes of the Tootflits, and at their door was a pile of rusting coins which had clearly been left as a gt or good luck charm. Rusting coins also lay all around the base of the tree.I understand the desire to leave a gt or charm for a magical creature, but polluting and damaging nature with the ultimate symbol of materialism was, for me, horribly ironic.We removed what we could, and my daughter Skye searched for a more suitable gt. She found a small lsquofaerie cuprsquo, which was the cupule of an acorn, and placed it on the doorstep.ldquoThere, she said, with a sense of satisfaction.We continued our search but we found every sculpture defaced in the same way. One had actually collapsed due to the splintering and rot caused by the coins being hammered into it.The final sculpture was a frog on a log. It too was peppered with coins hammered into its body. In the universal measure of things, this damage was insignicant and perhaps even well-meaning, for I assume it was done by people who came to enjoy the wood and merely wanted to leave their charm here.But eventhere was no malice, it was a desecration. Then my heart tore as I watched my children scrape their fingers as they tried to pull the coins from the poor creature.

There is a big waiting list in the county and we hope to open a base here.But planning officers urged councillors to reject LARrsquos proposals, regardless of their own efforts to build housing there two years ago.Iain McFarlane, head of planning, said that two years ago the council did not have its Local Development Plan approved and faced a shortage of land for affordable housing.Now the plan had been adopted, he said there was sufficient land supply for the next five years.He said allowing housing on the site would set an ldquoundesirable precedent, adding it would be ldquoselling our employment plans down the river.Councillor Kenny McLeod, committee member, said he was ldquodeeply uncomfortable about refusing planning permission on a site the council had tried to develop in the same way two years ago.At the time, council officers said the landowner rejected their pound, offer as too low.Robin Holder, representing LAR at the meeting, said the council had given written reassurance it would consider the site, which has lain empty since , for housing.He rejected claims that approving the plans would set a precedent, saying: ldquoThis is a small area, this site is a quarter of one per cent of land identied for industrial use in East Lothian.

Six months on, teachers detect an increase in concentration during class and greatly enhanced sociability in break-time. As one of the schoolrsquos sub-wardens remarked: ldquoBefore the ban you could walk into a room in total silence, because everyone was glued to their phones. It became a pleasure to walk into the dining room at lunch time and see  pupils actually talking to one another rather than staring at their screens. Kilgraston, a private school for girls in Bridge of Earn, recently implemented the same policy, with similar findings.: Agenda: Pupils need balance of screen time and healthy activityTherersquos no doubt that, in terms of inidual happiness, the new-found willingness to chat and make friends is what matters most. Whether or not a sharper focus during school hours will translate into better exam results is yet to be seen, but you donrsquot need to be a psephologist to predict the likelihood of a direct correlation.The effect of a clamorous phone on young peoplersquos prospects is probably the subject of a hundred half-written PhDs. Across Europe and North America, teachers and lecturers are inventively trying to mitigate the attritional effect these devices might be having on studentsrsquo attention spans.At a formative age, exam grades and social skills are the foundation on which the rest of a le is built. This is not to say itrsquos impossible to retake exams, or learn belatedly how to hold a conversation, but the earlier these stepping stones are crossed the better.Itrsquoll be fascinating to see what comes of Glenalmondrsquos initiative. In the meantime, I canrsquot help thinking itrsquos not just in schools that locking up devices would be beneficial, and not only the young who need weaning or protecting. The compulsive desire constantly to check for missed calls, texts, social media, games, music or whatever  this seductively pocket-sized companion can offer is an addiction.Adults are every bit as much in thrall as younger generations, fingers twitching like a chain smokerrsquos in search of a fag whenever their device is beyond reach. Studies on our use of phones show an alarming frequency of touching, swiping and scrolling: around  times a day according to some .Touching them has become an uncontrollable reflex that interrupts even the most serious occasions. Bad enough a phone ringing from the casket as it rolls into the furnace, but how much worse when itrsquos grieving attenders who cannot get through the funeral without a quick check on the football results or snapchat. Who didnrsquot laugh to hear John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, chastise Andrea Leadsom and one of her colleagues for ldquofiddling with their phones during a Commons debate last week  Even in far less exalted offices Irsquove seen executives ostentatiously sneak a look during high-powered meetings.Those who then leave the room to take a call are effectively demonstrating that they are king of the jungle, whereas subordinates must wait until the session is ended.In the space of two decades, mobiles have infiltrated all but our sleeping hours. Irsquove lost count of the talks Irsquove attended where some in the audience have skimmed messages or Googled within plain sight of the speaker. When yoursquore the one giving the speech, seeing a face uplit by a screen is only marginally less distracting than a person snoring in the front row.Catching somebody tweeting, which some event organisers actively promote, can also be seriously off-putting. Not as irritating, though, as when my husband attended a court case, where his fellow journalists were tweeting every few minutes.Whenever they did so, they then asked him to fill them in on what the accused or witnesses or judge had said while their attention was distracted.The issue is not the importance of our phones, but one of control. We should be in charge of them, rather than the other way round. Yet something in these devices panders to a universal need for stimulus and novelty, for any excuse not to think deeply for very long also, to the primitive fear of being left out.As a result, these bits of plastic become our masters, demanding unswerving loyalty. In a way that would have been inconceivable in George Orwellrsquos or Ray Bradburyrsquos day, this tiny tyrant holds the power to connect us to the rest of the world. If left unattended it threatens to strand us on an island called lonely, or boring, or too old.Irsquom waiting for the day when we see the Queen step onto a podium to cut a ribbon, and tuck away her phone before reaching for the scissors. When that hour arrives, wersquoll know for certain that we have lost our struggle against the march of the machines."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-alex-mcleish-in-full-on-bond-mode","story":"OUR sports pages reported that Scotland boss Alex McLeish is on the verge of being sacked.

In this case, Jack and Victor were widowed pensioners, pootling around with their pals. Just like the gang in Last of the Summer Wine, but no-one would ever confuse the two. Still Game was punk to Summer Winersquos Donny Osmond: spiky, ahead of the game, uniquely Scottish in its outlook and taste for tragi-comedy. Oh, and it was ******* fond of swearing.:TV REVIEW: Did Still Game go out with a bang or a whimper The mix of light and shade was evident from the opening episode, now available on Netflix. ldquoFlittinrsquo starts with a cosy scene of an elderly chap, Jack Ford Kiernan, co-creator with Greg Hemphill gardening. Then the woman next door bursts into the street threatening to batter her husband, and the neighbour upstairs flicks his fag into the pensionerrsquos attempt at Eden. All Scottish le, as it is lived in certain parts, is here. Goodness and decency versus what a police comedy to come would call ldquothe bams.It is a world away from The One OrsquoClock Gang, many peoplersquos first taste of Scottish television comedy. Running on Scottish Television and starring Dorothy Paul, Jimmy Nairn, Larry Marshall and Charlie Sim, the s sketch and song show could be politely described as patchy.From there any tour of Scottish comedy would take in The Vital Spark, Francie and Josie, Stanley Baxter, Scotch and Wry, Naked Video, Rab C Nesbitt, and on to Chewinrsquo the Fat, where Kiernan and Hemphill displayed their talents, finally arriving at Still Game.The show ran from - before Kiernan and Hemphill decided they had had enough, much to the shock of the BBC. As former BBC Scotland commissioner Ewan Angus told The Moments That Made Ford and Greg, a documentary shown last night: ldquoGenerally speaking, people do not walk away from successful shows, and do not walk away with a definite commission for a six-part series.Billy Connollys Ultimate World TourBut saunter away they did, ing in triumph in  with a record-shattering run of , sold out, live shows at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow.With the appetite clearly there for another show, the BBC came calling again and the shows met with initial success. By the eighth series, however, the comedy was starting to feel tired, the gentle patter and daft gags far outweighed by swearing, crudeness and slapstick.In truth, Scottish comedy had moved on. The age of Chewinrsquo the Fat had become the Iannucci era. Young comedians wanted to do things their own way, in keeping with the times. Kevin Bridges sold out the SSE Hydro, having made his name on TV, not in a sitcom but in  shows. Then there was the arrival of Netflix and other streaming services, bringing the best of world comedy to your TV set, tablet or smartphone.Still Game has a fixed place in Scotlandrsquos affections, says Dr Andy Dougan, lecturer in film and television studies at The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.:Cast say emotional goodbyes as Still Game airs final episodeldquoIt has managed to become that rarest of things, a national treasure. It is regarded with a fondness that has little to do with how funny it actually is.ldquoI donrsquot think it is as good or as groundbreaking as the show that spawned it, Chewinrsquo the Fat. Also, and this may be a generational thing, it is not as good as say Naked Video or Rab C. Nesbitt. These were shows that said something important about the culture in which they were broadcast which Still Game doesnrsquot really do.Still Game is perhaps best seen as the bridge between old Scots comedy and new, between traditional sitcoms and todayrsquos edgier offerings. With nine series to its name, two more than Only Fools and Horses, it stands comparison with the best of them. Wherever the road goes next for comedy, and for Kiernan and Hemphill, there will always be a drink behind the bar for Still Game."},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-power-to-the-people-but-it-has-to-be-processed-through-parliament","story":"The happy spectacle came as MPs seized control of the parliamentary agenda and the political classes continued to battle their way through the tortuous never-ending Brexit process.Today, there will be yet another episode of the political reality show.Theresa May will seek to get round MPs rejecting her deal for a third time by splitting the process in two first the Withdrawal Agreement bit about the orce process and then, later, the Political Declaration bit about the UKrsquos future relationship with the EU.It is a somewhat crude attempt to buy time as the EUrsquos offer was for Parliament to pass the Withdrawal Agreement this week to get the May  extension. Once  that is done, then the Government would come back to pass part two in a third meaningful vote. Good luck.However, the level of opposition outrage at the Prime Ministerrsquos latest political contortion from the likes of Labour and the SNP, not to mention the Toriesrsquo supposed parliamentary partners, the DUP, suggests it could well fail.A number of indignant MPs accused the Tory Government of skulduggery and suggested its move could even prove to be illegal. But the stentorian Attorney General Geoffrey Cox assured MPs that Mrs Mayrsquos strategy was ldquoperfectly reasonable andhellip perfectly lawful\".Perhaps Julian Lewis, the senior Conservative backbencher, spoke for many when he said MPs had been left \"in tears\" at the prospect of \"yet again\" being asked to vote on the same proposals when they had \"twice taken the dficult decision to vote against a three-line whip\".If the Government fails today, then the focus willto Parliamentrsquos attempt to find a centre of Brexit gravity on Monday with another look at the alternatives.The customs union is favourite but, given Mrs May is staunchly opposed to it as it goes against the Tory manesto, then we could end up in another Brexican stand-off between Government and Parliament.Such is the level of daily confusion and uncertainty swilling around the corridors of Westminster, MPs have become accustomed to living day by day, trying to comprehend the ins and outs of the latest development and not knowing quite how events will unfold tomorrow.Today, a large pro-Brexit demonstration is expected outside the House of Commons.The word ldquobetrayal will be on many protestersrsquo lips given that March  was supposed to be ldquoindependence day. But now, of course, Brexit could happen on April  or May  or at some point in the distant future or not at all.Sadly, the Brexit process has coarsened the political debate, fuelled often by the rages and rants on social media.The people have spoken, voters insist, so why cannot politicians just get on with it and implement their will  Simples, as Mrs May, might say.But, of course, the torment that ministers and MPs are going through on a daily basis underlines how this is far from a straightforward exercise.The  vote produced a clear proposition: the UK should leave the EU. Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, has argued how Parliament transferred its sovereignty to the people on EU membership and so should now comply with their instruction.But the reality is in a representative democracy sovereignty always lies with Parliament.Edmund Burke, the th century philosopher, famously argued that those elected were trustees not delegates.ldquoYour representative owes you, not his industry only but his judgement and he betrays, instead of serving you,he sacrices it to your opinion.\"The way our democracy works is that it flows through Parliament. Eventhere is a referendum, the decision has to be processed by MPs and peers.If for whatever reason they cannot, the only option, ultimately, is to put it back to the people for another decision which will once again have to be processed by Parliament. Hopefully, successfully the second time round.If voters do not like what MPs do or say, they have the power, every five years in a general election, to kick them out and elect someone they think will do and say what they want.Mr Burke was, to say the least, highly sceptical about the merits of democracy. As fate would have it after he expounded his controversial beliefs on what representative government meant in , voters - however few of them there were at the time - exercised their right and kicked him out.

Any detailed discussions on the future relationship could then take place after Brexit happened.However, the chances of Mrs May getting the Withdrawal Agreement through appear slim given it contains the controversial Irish backstop customs arrangement, which continues to represent the biggest obstacle to support from Northern Irelandrsquos Democratic Unionists and Brexit-backing Tories in the anti-EU European Research Group.In a -minute phonecall with the PM yesterday, Jeremy Corbyn confirmed Labour MPs would not back the Government move.A party spokesman said: \"He made clear Labour will not agree a blindfold Brexit to force through Theresa Mays damaging deal, which would leave the next Tory Party leader free to rip up essential rights and protections and undermine jobs and living standards.\"Mrs Mayrsquos dramatic offer to resign on Wednesday night to enable a successor to take over the second part of the Brexit process in negotiating the future UK-EU relationship had limited success. While some Tory Brexiteers swung behind her plan as the ldquoleast worst option, others did not.And the DUP reaffirmed its own opposition to it as it would carve out Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK by putting a regulatory border down the Irish Sea.After John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, made clear the Government could not bring back a substantially unchanged Brexit plan - given it had been heavily rejected twice - ministers and officials had to scratch their heads to find a way to present it again.Having a debate and vote on just the Withdrawal Agreement was ruled in order by Mr Bercow and Andrea Leadsom, the Commons Leader, urged all MPs to ldquosupport it and ensure that we leave the EU on May , giving people and businesses the certainty they need\".But the Governmentrsquos highly unusual move sparked an outcry on opposition benches.Labourrsquos Valerie Vaz accused UK ministers of treating MPs in an ldquoabsolutely disgraceful way, which underlined their disrespect for Parliament.\"This is the Government playing games, declared the Shadow Leader. ldquoParliament, our constituents, future trading partners and the country will not countenance this.\"Ben Bradshaw, the former Labour Cabinet Minister, warned the Government against using ldquomore attempted trickery or potentially illegal trickery by separating out the Withdrawal Agreement from the Political Declaration.His Labour colleague, Mary Creagh told MPs: \"This is an extraordinary and unprecedented reverse ferret of the commitments that have been given by ministers to this place...that we should have our say on both items together.\"And is it not extraordinary that we have this coming right on the day when we know there are going to be far-right demonstrators gathering in Parliament Square \" asked the Yorkshire MP.The SNPrsquos Pete Wishart was scathing, insisting Westminsterrsquos processes over Brexit were in an ldquoabsolute guddle.He explained: ldquoIt has almost got to the point in this House where it is so broken and the debate is so corrupted that we are now having debates through Points of Order. I can barely imagine that we have reached that stage just now it demonstrates how badly broken things are.The Nationalistsrsquo Shadow Leader added todayrsquos sitting was ldquoall about the Governmentrsquos latest wheeze to get their doomed Brexit deal through.He added: ldquoThey are inviting us to consider the Withdrawal Agreement without the Political Declaration attached. It is a meaningful vote but it is a sort of Schroumldingerrsquos meaningful vote it is both alive and dead at the same time.Labourrsquos Chris Bryant described todayrsquos vote as a ldquomeaningless one and warned the Government: ldquoThe one precedent Im absolutely sure the House always abided by in the past and will abide by probably tomorrow is when the Government comes up with a policy, a change of mood, change of style, a dferent way of doing business which is too clever by half, it always loses.\"Ms Vaz also warned the Government motion could risk seeing the law \"being broken\" as it did not meet the requirements of the  European Union Withdrawal Act.But Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, sought to reassure MPs, saying: \"When the House listens to the rationale behind it, when it hears the full context of it, Im sure the House will accept it is not only perfectly lawful, perfectly sensible and is designed to give this House an opportunity of availing itself of a right the European Union has given to us to avail ourselves of an extension until May .\"The view of the Government is simply we could not let the time limit expire at pm tomorrow of allowing this House the opportunity of availing itself of that right. It is perfectly reasonable and it is perfectly lawful,\" he insisted.Sir Edward Leigh, the former Conservative minister, said his colleague Sir Oliver Letwin, the architect behind the process of so-called ldquoindicative votes, would take control on Monday to pursue Brexit deal alternativesthe Withdrawal Agreement were not approved before then.\"There is nothing to stop him now under our procedures from whittling down the options to one option, which almost certainly given the results last night would be permanent membership of the customs union.\"There is nothing to stop him putting this in a Bill, there is nothing stopping him making that an Act of Parliament and then the choice will be between - and I say this to my colleagues - permanent membership of the customs union or a general election,\" added the Lincolnshire MP.Mrs Leadsom replied: \"I certainly feel this House needs to agree to fulfil on the  referendum and the Prime Ministers deal offers the means by which to deliver on that referendum but at the same time for those, who dont want to leave the European Union, to offer the closest economic and security partnership, it is a compromise and I do urge colleagues right across the House to back it.\"At Holyrood, the FM clashed with Jackson Carlaw, the interim Scottish Conservative leader, over the issue.Ms Sturgeon declared: \"This whole process thanks to the Tories is now such a mess that stopping Brexit altogether must now be our top priority.There was criticism of SNP MPs, who voted against the proposal for the UK to have a customs union with the EU despite the party having long argued in favour of a soft Brexit, which would mean the UK staying within both this and the European single market.Mr Carlaw accused the Nationalist leader of attempting to stock up \"faux outrage, grievance\" on her \"single-minded obsession\" of independence.\"When it came to the crunch the First Minister whipped her MPs against supporting her own policy of a customs union,\" declared the Eastwood MSP.\"Isnt it the case that what Scotland saw yet again yesterday is then when push comes to shove for the SNP it is not about finding a solution to Brexit it is about pursuing their independence obsession.\"But Ms Sturgeon hit back, saying: \"For two long years when stopping Brexit didnt seem possible the SNP argued for single market customs union membership compromise that was ignored by the Tories and indeed everybody .In other developments -*Speaking at the British Chambers of Commerce conference, David Lidington, Mays de facto deputy, pleaded with MPs to back the Brexit deal, saying: ldquoPoliticians of all political parties have a duty to put the national interest first so that we can put this controversy behind us and move on to a bright future for the British people.\"*Boris Johnson, who indicated he would back the PMrsquos deal following her resignation announcement, has reportedly told friends: ldquoItrsquos dead anyway.*A poll suggested Brexit was now the most important issue for Scots when consideringthe nation should be independent.

And why should it  Wednesdayrsquos votes on eight dferent options , showed that five of the eight were more popular than the deal Mrs May is still flogging, like some specialist purveyor of hippic euthanasia.Since none of those hypothetical options secured a majority, we neednrsquot worry about their qualities, nor about the small detail of whether they would be acceptable to the EU. All the same, it says something about the obtuseness of MPs that the order of their preferences was more or less the opposite of the relative merits of each plan, and probably of popular opinion.It would be tempting, and satisfying, to lay the blame for this on the stupidity, cowardice and lack of principle that characterises the Parliamentary Conservative Party. There ought to be a new measure of political debasementto describe MPs who, out of nothing but naked personal ambition, now say that they might be prepared to back the WA after all.But the ghastliness of Tory MPs is matched, perhaps even superseded, by the abysmal quality of Opposition MPs. They have almost universally seen Brexit not as a liberation, an opportunity, a challenge, a problem, or a danger ndash or any of the other things you might choose to see it as ndash for the country but, instead, as an opportunity to promote their own, or their partyrsquos, fortunes. The view of Jeremy Corbyn and his clique is clearly that theyrsquod like Mrs Mayrsquos deal to go through, and then prove a disaster, so that he stands a chance of getting elected. This ignores the fact that the only reason Mrs May is still in her job, with approval ratings of minus is that the Labour leaderrsquos rating is minus . The view of most Labour MPs seems to be that theyrsquod like to revoke it, while a scant majority of Labour voters wantto see it implemented.The SNP, naturally, views the debate solely in terms of what it might mean for the prospects for independence, cheerfully picking and choosing from contradictory arguments about the will of the people, the necessity of abiding by referendum results and the dficulty of unpicking years of shared laws, regulation, industry and economic policy from political unions, as long as it suits their agenda.What the Liberal Democrats, who ought to be polling at least  per cent, are doing, I have no idea. Except that Sir Vince Cable seems to have anticipated Mrs Mayrsquos novel policy of announcing a resignation but nonetheless staying in the job, getting in everyonersquos way. The DUP seems to see the current chaos as a nice little earner.But with the imminentresignation of Mrs May, it is naturally the Conservative party that is getting attention. Yet the Prime Ministerrsquos departure is what logicians would describe as necessary but not sufficient. If shersquos only going to goshe gets her deal through, wersquod have a new PM shackled by a deal which he or she didnrsquot devise, and probably detests ndash we know that because everybody except Mrs May detests it. For the Tory party there are the additional dficulties of finding a new leader who fulfills all the following criteria: pro-Brexit capable of sorting out a dogrsquos dinner not totally discredited already and stands some chance of winning a general election.:Patrick Harvie: Disrespect shown to Scotland is reason enough to push for independenceA lot of party members would also like the candidate to be a Tory, since all the non-Brexit policies introduced by the Government have been profoundly unConservative unsurprisingly, since the manesto on which they ran the last time wasthe most Left-wing since .You may, like so many people, have no sympathy with the Tories. Indeed, even those well-disposed towards the party have no reason to approve of the current shower, given their demonstrable failure to do any of the things that are supposed to be the Conservativesrsquo long suit safeguarding the national interest, competently administering the economy, resisting useless and bossy legislation and so on.

Given the boom and bust history of the herring fishery, these fish need all the help they can get.ldquoHerring are one of the foundations of healthy seas. If the stock was to recover on the west coast it could underpin the future of our fishing industry and rural communities for decades to come. Spawning grounds are precious and we are urging the Scottish Government to protect the full, known extent of the herring spawning ground in Gairloch.Every year herring swim from deep offshore seas towards our coasts where each female fish lays tens of thousands of eggs.The eggs stick to the seabed and after a few weeks develop into fish larvae - the next generation.Herring spawning used to take place in such huge numbers that there are tales of the waters turning white with fish eggs.Such massive spawning events give food to seals, seabirds, dolphins and other fish, and where stocks are healthy, such as in Canada, these events still bring in huge numbers of other marine wildle. A famous spawning ground in Gairloch has been closed to bottom-towed fishing, such as prawn-trawling and scallop dredging, for over  years.West coast herring stocks continue to decline and the International Council for the Exploration of the Seasays that all measures should be taken to protect the places where herring spawn to improve their chances for the future."},{"url":null,"title":"1 8m funding for wedding venue","story":"An Inverurie wedding venue has secured a #. million finance package from HSBC UK to invest in property updates and marketing efforts.Logie Country House, which was purchased by Tim and Stef Erbe in , is located on a Scottish estate that dates back to the s.The impressive castle, which sits in -acres of Aberdeenshire countryside, was badly damaged in a fire in  and remained vacant until the Erbes acquired the property.The funding from HSBC UK has enabled Tim and Stef to install a new heating system, make cosmetic updates to the property and increase awareness of the venue in Scotland through renewed marketing initiatives, in an effort to remain one of Scotland’s top exclusive use wedding venues.Tim said: “We’ve spent years turning Logie Country House into the elegant place it is today and HSBC UK’s immediate understanding of our business objectives and eagerness to support us has been indispensable as we continue to update the property and develop a stronger marketing strategy, ultimately so we can remain competitive with other luxury wedding venues in Scotland.” Susan Rowand, Head of Business Banking in Scotland, HSBC UK said: “We’re committed to helping Scottish businesses realise their ambitions and Logie Country House is no dferent.“Tim and Stef’s passion for hosting memorable events has been apparent since day one and we’re looking forward to supporting them as they grow their business.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.berwickshirenews webimage ..!

Member who asked the questiona no deal Brexit could expose lamb exports to a . per cent plus €. kg tarf.

Nothing yesterday was supported by the House. The deal is the best thing for agriculture, the best thing for the future, and the best thing for a long-term relationship between ourselves and the European Union.Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “For Brexiteers to talk about the post-Brexit agriculture industry being of #paramount importance# while cheerfully voting for a #no deal# Brexit that could destroy it, smacks of hypocrisy. Our farmers and crofters need to realise that those who promote #no-deal# Brexit are not on their side. They are prepared to damage the livelihoods of our livestock farmers and crofters to pursue their Brexit unicorns.“The test for any deal the government comes back with for our rural communities, must be whether it allows them to continue to access key European export markets. No-deal clearly fails that fundamental test and will make our farmers and crofters worse off.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The subsidy is unlawful state aid and it will disturb the market.”The company decided to go to Scotland’s highest civil court after an announcement from the Scottish Government last month. The ministers had decided to name three companies who are bidding to provide ferry services between Aberdeen and Orkney and Shetland.Final tenders for the contract are expected to be submitted by the end of April  and the successful firm will receive a subsidy estimated to be worth around £ million.Legal papers lodged in the case show that Pentland Ferries seeks a declarator from the court that the proposed subsidy is unlawful and breaches obligations placed upon the government by EU law.Today saw lawyers for the Scottish government argued that the ministers had acted lawfully.Having finished hearing from both sides, Lord Boyd said he’d issue his decision at some point in the near future.See next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian for the full story.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It has rejected no Brexit. On Wednesday it rejected all the iations of the deal on the table.ldquoAnd today it has rejected approving the Withdrawal Agreement alone and continuing a process on the future.ldquoThis Government will continue to press the case for the orderly Brexit that the result of the referendum demands. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Jeremy Corbyn demanded a general electionthe Prime Minister was not willing to change course--Mr Corbyn told MPs: ldquoThe House has been clear this deal now has to change, there has to be an alternative found.ldquoAndthe Prime Minister canrsquot accept that then she must go ndash not at an indeterminate date in the future but now, so that we can decide the future of this country through a general election.The deputy chairman of the European Research Group of Tory Eurosceptics, Steve Baker, called on Mrs May to step down immediately.Declaring that this should be ldquothe final defeat for the PMrsquos deal ndash already rejected by  votes in January and  in March ndash Mr Baker said: ldquoI regret to say it is time for Theresa May to follow through on her words and make way so that a new leader can deliver a Withdrawal Agreement which will be passed by Parliament. -- vw,vw,px, px\" --The fate of Mrs Mayrsquos deal was sealed as  Conservative MPs went through the No lobby, while only five Labour MPs voted with the Prime Minister.The number of Tory rebels was fewer than half the  who opposed the deal in the Meaningful Vote of March  but enough to overturn the result had they voted the other way.Among rebels were hardline Brexiteers including Mr Baker, Sir Bill Cash, Priti Patel, Owen Paterson and Sir John Redwood, along with supporters of a softer deal like Dominic Grieve, Justine Greening and Sam Gyimah. -- vw,vw,px, px\" --Labour MPs backing the deal were Kevin Barron, Rosie Cooper, Jim Fitzpatrick, Caroline Flint and John Mann,along with the partyrsquos former MPs Frank Field and Ian Austin, now sitting as independents.DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said Mrs May had missed ldquonumerous opportunitiesto remedy the ldquodeficiencies in proposed backstop arrangements for the Irish border, which made the deal unacceptable to his party.ldquoOver the coming weeks and months, we will continue to play a central role to chart a route that respects the democratic desire to leave the European Union but that does so in a way that strengthens our United Kingdom, said Mr Dodds.copy -.

According to the new figures, the issue of EU membership has gone from being of concern to just  per cent of voters at the time of the  independence vote, to being the main concern at  per cent - above the economy and the NHS.And the poll, of more than  people, found that of those \"undecided\" on independence,  per cent now believe Brexit will make it more likely, with just  per cent disagreeing. It also found that  per cent of formerly undecided voters have changed their view on independence as a result of Brexit.And while  per cent of the same cohort say they will wait to see the impact of Brexit before deciding how they would vote in any new independence referendum, that changed to  per cent saying they would be more likely to back independence in the event of a no deal Brexit.The polling will give a boost to those in the independence movement who have been agitating for a second referendum. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she will reveal what her next steps will be on a second indyref in a matter of weeks.However when all those polled were asked, on a sliding scale, where they stood on Scottish independence only  per cent said they “completely supported” the idea, with  per cent saying they “completely supported staying in the UK”.Mark Dfley, who designed the questions for the poll said: “Since June , politics across the UK has been dominated by the issue of Brexit. It is therefore unsurprising that, on the day that the UK had been due to leave the EU, new polling highlights the pivotal role that the issue of EU membership and Brexit is likely to play in any future Scottish independence referendum.“The importance of the EU as an issue which drives opinion on independence has doubled  per cent of voters put EU membership in the top two or three issues which determined their vote in . Now, that figure is  per cent making it the single most important issue for voters in another referendum.\"He added that the provides evidence of how the issue of the EU might impact on voters who have no firm position on the independence question. \"The poll suggests that this cohort of ‘open-minded’ Scots has both strong views on the EU and is reassessing its views on independence in light of the Brexit debate,\" he said.Progress Scotland Managing Director Angus Robertson said: “These findings illustrate the signicant impact that Brexit is having on the views of open-minded people towards Scottish independence.

The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues. However, some items such as these documents are too fragile to be on long-term display, so putting them online is a great way to showcase them.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"british airways flight bound for germany lands in edinburgh by mistake","story":"Passengers were stunned when they were greeted with a \"Welcome to Edinburgh\" message after the British Airways flight touched down in the Scottish capital.

Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #.The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth.The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society.Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory.

Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi. Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time.However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on.Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind @Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting.Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners.At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go.How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy.Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust.Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn.Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were. They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence.

You had delegates from Ireland and UK coming to attend the conference and being met with Paisley’s ‘Save Ulster From Sodomy’ campaign. The welcome was much warmer in this community club.”Starring in the production as one of the Manchester delegates, Gransha actor Brendan Quinn describes the piece and its themes “as very important in ”.“I’m from Gransha and my parents weren’t even aware of the story which is just crazy. The delegates were welcomed in, had a célií, had their breakfast the next day and were driven back down to Queen’s. I think the play is very relevant, even in  especially in terms of inequality. Northern Ireland is the only place where gay couples cannot legally get married – how far have we actually come since   Really not that far when you think about it. It’s a story that needs to be told and it’s a story done with such truth,” he said.Finaghy’s Simon Sweeney plays the youngest of the delegate group.“The character I play is only -years-old in the piece and since he’s under  he can be punished for being a gay man, he can be imprisoned. It’s a rock on his back he’s carrying the whole time.“The character I play wants to champion the change of law and that’s not being immediately discussed at the conference and he feels that he is not being represented, that comes up in the play and the character is then encouraged to see the bigger picture and not to be so selfish in his aims.”Being a young cast Brendan and Simon were encouraged by Paula to not play some of their scenes so “light”.“We don’t remember barricades, checkpoints, things that were so common during this time,” said Brendan. “Paula reminded that as well as the fun elements this is a serious play with important themes. It’s great to be a part of that.”A Queer Céilí at the Marty Forsythe will be performed at Trinity Lodge from Wednesday March  until Friday March . Saturday night is sold out.Tickets are priced at £ and £ and you can book online at www.imaginebelfast or telephone on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit has put irish unity debate on the horizon mary mcaleese","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Institute Conference, Mrs McAleese said that the public has a duty to ensure the “groundwork is laid” ahead of any Irish unity referendum.Mrs McAleese, who is a professor of children, law and religion at the University of Glasgow, said the debate is part of the Good Friday Agreement.“It’s out there, the when of it we do not know but nonetheless, it’s on the horizon, ahead of us,” she said.The  Belfast Agreement states that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland may call such a referendumat any time it appears likely that the majority of voters in Northern Ireland would wish to leave the United Kingdom and enter into a united Ireland.Professor McAleese claimed that Irish unity has focused on crude numbers of Catholics and nationalists “over and against” Protestants and unionists.“And it has focused on the coming demographic changes which will in a relatively short time, give Northern Catholics a voting majority,” she added.“We have instead now this opportunity to develop a wholly fresh focus on the future, making it a place of transcendence, where multiple identities can be respected, be accommodated, can grow to become one community, gathered around the principles of the Good Friday Agreement and the European Union.Long before any futurereferendum goes live, we need to do what Brexit has abjectly failed to doMary McAleeseFacebookTwitter“Clear sighted people can now see that we are navigating, we’ve been nudged off the old trajectory, what I might call the ‘wrap the green flag around me’ trajectory, into a much much healthier space where our focus is on let’s talk about what a shared future might look like, let’s hear the fears, let’s hear the imagination and creativity we can bring, and what decency we can bring to resolving those fears and those issues.”She added that the public has to learn from the “Brexit debacle”.“Someday they will be asked to decide that, and those of us, and I am one of them, who believe that the truest and best potential of this entire island and all its people will only be realised when Northern Ireland and Ireland merge, and emerge as a modern, European democracy, inclusive of all, respectful of all,” she said.“Long before any future referendum goes live, we need to do what Brexit has abjectly failed to do.“That is to delve deeply, objectively, consciously, in a considered way, into all the issues, whatever they are, the ,, the , issues, that would be raised by the ending of partition and the creation of a new reconciled Ireland.”She added that these range from fears, identity, to governance and representation, and from flags and emblems and anthems.“From economics to esoterics, we need an army of scholars and lawyers and of intellectuals, and of people of good will, and we need a reservoir of credible good will to approach these issues in a respectful way, before they overwhelm us, as those very issues have overwhelmed and stymied Brexit,” she added."},{"url":null,"title":"dup urges pm

has urged the Government toto Brussels to demand changes that would make the backstop acceptable to Parliament..pushDeputy leader Nigel Dodds said the EU’s resistance to amending the Withdrawal Agreement must be challenged by the Prime Minister.Mr Dodds said his party had “consistently and repeatedly” made it clear it will not support the deal until the construction of the contentious backstop protocol is changed.Reacting after the Withdrawal Agreement was defeated for the third time in the Commons, the North Belfast MP said: “We have reached this view from a principled position, as we do not believe the Withdrawal Agreement is the best way forward for the United Kingdom.The arguments we have advanced are well understood across Parliament and there is strong recognition in the House of Commons that Northern Ireland cannot be subjected to new and onerous trade barriers within the United Kingdom as the price of leaving the European UnionNigel DoddsFacebookTwitter“We have said that were the backstop to become operational, Northern Ireland would sit in a separate legal position from the rest of the United Kingdom in economic and trade terms.“In those circumstances, there is the strong possibility that we could have a long-term outcome whereby Northern Ireland would inevitably pull away from its biggest trading market in Great Britain as there would be new internal barriers within the United Kingdom.”Activateda wider EU UK trade deal fails to materialise before the end of the Brexit implementation period, the backstop would see the UK enter into a temporary customs union with the EU – to avoid the need for customs checks on the Irish border.It would also see Northern Ireland adhere to EU single market rules on goods – again to rule out the necessity for border regulatory checks.The DUP believes binding Northern Ireland to single market rules would create a regulatory border between the region and the rest of the UK – a move, it contends, that would undermine the constitutional integrity of the Union.The party has not been convinced by Theresa May’s efforts to provide reassurances on the backstop.The Prime Minister secured a number of legal add-ons to the agreement from the EU – documents the Government insisted provided assurances around the temporary nature of the measure and over potential routes to exit it.She has also pledged to use domestic law to beef up Stormont’s role on backstop matters and has made commitments that the rest of the UK will not erge from the EU regulations applied in Northern Ireland.Mr Dodds said the moves had not gone far enough.We deeply regret the numerous missed opportunities by those who negotiated on behalf of the UK to listen to our warnings about the dangers of the backstop and to take steps to remedy those deficienciesNigel DoddsFacebookTwitter“In our recent discussions with the Government, good progress has been made on how domestic legislation would assist in ensuring the economic integrity of the UK as a whole and recognising Northern Ireland’s particular situation sharing a land border with the European Union,” he said.“However, regretfully the fact remains that sufficient progress has not been made.“We have encouraged the Government to do, asDominic Raab has said, toto Brussels on these issues and not simply to accept the position of the European Union as being unalterable.“The Government must use the remaining time to deal with widely held concerns across the House of Commons.”He added: “For our part, we will continue to use our position and influence within Parliament and with the Government to strongly argue the case for Northern Ireland and to work through each of the legislative stages in Parliament to eliminate the risk of Northern Ireland and its place within the internal market in the UK.“The arguments we have advanced are well understood across Parliament and there is strong recognition in the House of Commons that Northern Ireland cannot be subjected to new and onerous trade barriers within the United Kingdom as the price of leaving the European Union.“The United Kingdom’s long-term relationship with the European Union will need to accord with our key objectives to ensure the economic integrity of the United Kingdom.“We deeply regret the numerous missed opportunities by those who negotiated on behalf of the UK to listen to our warnings about the dangers of the backstop and to take steps to remedy those deficiencies.“Over the coming weeks and months, we will continue to play a central role to chart a route that respects the democratic desire to leave the European Union but that does so in a way that strengthens our United Kingdom.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish opposition voice disappointment at rejection of

It would devastate the British economy, and the time for putting politics before the livelihoods of people is long over,” he said.“There’s a need now to think of businesses, to think of jobs.”The party’s Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers said a no-deal Brexit remained a distinct possibility and that intensive efforts must now be made to avoid such a “catastrophic outcome”.Where to next !

Full UK-wide participation in the customs union and single market is acceptable to the DUP because it does not leave Northern Ireland aligned to the EU in isolation.It would maintain a soft border, debunking the persistent myth that the DUP wants a hard border.On Wednesday, the DUP opposed harder Brexit options - such as customs union membership alone - because it would not remove the backstop on which the May-EU withdrawal agreement rests.The DUP also rejected Labours fantasy option of membership of a customs union - asthere is an a la carte menu of such unions - in which the UK would miraculously continue to have the right to its own global trade deals and input to those of the EU.Belatedly, the dferences between the European Research Group - obsessed with Brexit - and the DUP - preoccupied only with Northern Irelands equal Brexit alongside the rest of the UK - have begun to be laid bare. Boris bin, ditch and junk the backstop Johnson wont be getting a repeat slot at the next DUP conference.Having used the event to launch his Conservative Party ascendancy, any fidelity to the DUP dissolved the moment Theresa May said \"support my backstop deal and theres a leadership vacancy\".Shameless is too inadequate a word.Et tu, Jacob Ill only changethe DUP moves Rees-Mogg, you changed as the DUP held steadfast. The DUP conference gig could have been yours, Jacob. I was looking forward to the first such gathering to be addressed in Latin.Many continue to criticise the DUP. The extensive support for the backstop across Northern Irelands business and farming communities shows a determination that economic logic ought to trump constitutional politics. Seamless access to EU and UK single markets matters, protecting livelihoods.To those at risk, this matters more than unproven claims that Northern Irelands unique alignment to the EU single market would be a constitutional betrayal, jeopardising the Union.In trying to persuade the DUP onside, the UK Government has made clear that it will not allow regulatory ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.In other words,EU single market regulations change, the Government will adopt them across the UK to protect Northern Irelands EU and UK trading relationships.The problem is that the DUP will not trust successor governments to honour that pledge.A certain mythology has developed over the seamlessness of Northern Irelands place in the UK single market.A reader, Alan Brookes, contacted me wondering how many people recalled that some British people from where in the UK could not work in Northern Ireland from  until  without a work permit.Such permitswere issued only to qualied essential workers, with notable exceptions such as members of the Armed Forces, religious ministers and teachers.Under the old Stormont regime, the Safeguard of Employment Act was designed to create local jobs for local workers. Brookes recalls his final interview with a Northern Ireland engineering firm in . \"When they asked did I need a work permit as I was born in England and I stated I did they immediately cooled and I was informed it would be too dficult\".There have long been checks on certain commodities travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and identication is always required.None of this has threatened the Union, but it has highlighted the distinctiveness of Northern Ireland.If the backstop worked well, it might possibly stem the rising demands of nationalists for constitutional change via a border poll and shore up the Union. After all, Northern Ireland only looks vaguely secure when it is economically prosperous and politically ing.Rarely, in other words.The DUPs intransigence has been matched by the EU steadfastly refusing to change a single word of the withdrawal agreement.There might be something faintly ridiculous about the chancelleries of Europe standing paralysed before Sammy Wilson, Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster, but its where we are.The DUP will never back the backstop in its current form. Amid all the noise, the party has at least been consistent, wanting a deal, but clear that no backstop removal equals no deal.What more can Theresa May do to sell her agreement given she has laid down her political le for the bargain  Rename it St Andrews perhaps The withdrawal agreement is as unsellable to the DUP as it is unchangeable for the EU. Mays promise to stand downher deal passes could be the longest resignation note in history. It is utterly irrelevant to the DUP. And the DUP do not fear a general election.Charting a way forward,the DUP does believe that UK-wide customs union and single market alignment to the EU solves the backstop conundrum, why not vote for it, rather than abstain,another opportunity arises For the DUP, its all about UKexit, not Brexit.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool and co-author of books on the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party"},{"url":null,"title":"poll 76 of belfast telegraph readers want orange order to lift ban on members attending","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That was never part of the deal and thats now where weve wandered towards because of the way in which the Prime Minister has conducted her negotiations.\"I dont think anyone would expect us - simply because were in a confidence-and-supply arrangement with them - to sign up to our own death warrant constitutionally.\"But while Theresa May has little chance of winning over the DUP, a softening of tone from some hardline Tory Eurosceptics is keeping her deal on le support.With MPs beginning to vote today on alternatives to the Withdrawal Agreement, there is a growing fear among Conservative Leave backbenchers that they could end up with no Brexit whatsoever or the softest of soft ones.Jacob Rees-Mogg has said that the Prime Ministers deal \"is better than not leaving at all\". Comments from Boris Johnson last night indicate thatMrs May announces she will step down soon, he might support her deal.If the vast majority of the ERG is scared into reluctantly backing the Withdrawal Agreement, along with enough Labour Brexiteers, there is a chance it could just scrape through the Commons on the third attempt.

A further invite to the programme providers and others to explain dferences in the terms and conditions for those employed in the Supporting People Programme.”UNISON has backed the workers throughout, and prior to the council meeting, urged elected members to support the motion.Yesterday, Niall McCarroll UNISON Community Branch Chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign has now taken a very positive step forward.Before the full council meeting UNISON held a Rally of Support for all frontline workers outside the NIHE offices, at the Richmond Chambers building.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMr McCarroll commented: “The purpose of this rally was to show all those who use supported living services and indeed the frontline workers that UNISON will be taking our campaign right to the front doors of all those statutory bodies with responsibility within the Supporting People Programme, demanding they start to value, service users, workers and indeed working class communities.“UNISON Community Branch activists worked closely with Independent Councillor Darren O’Reilly and Sinn Fein Councillor Patricia Logue in ensuring that the motion was not just aspirational but also radical in its core aims, this has now become the corporate position of DCSDC with regards the UNISON motion and we thank both councillors for their time and solidarity.“When council re convenes after the upcoming elections a delegation of UNISON Community Branch frontline workers will be invited by Council to give a presentation detailing their concerns, experiences and how they are struggling to survive both economically and socially, whilst completing specialist work supporting families and iniduals at risk.”‘Corporate greed’DCSDC will then invite the Department for Communities, Northern Ireland Housing Executive, Western Health and Social Care Trust, Regulation  Quality Improvement and all relevant employers within the City and District to provide further evidence which UNISON believes will further detail the crisis facing the Supporting People Programme and also “expose inequality and corporate greed, where it exists.”Mr McCarroll continued: “UNISON would like to put on record our gratitude to the elected representatives on DCSDC who supported the motion, a motion which clearly shouts out for social justice, equality, to uphold human rights and reflects solidarity to all frontline workers and those who need support and guidance through the Supporting People Programme.“The UNISON Community Branch Supporting People Campaign will now move into other working class communities across the North of Ireland, seeking support from the other  councils, gathering momentum, strength, power and influence as we ultimately reach a point that an independent review is commissioned or those choosing to block any review are removed from their positions by the trade union movement and radical campaigning involving ,working class communities.”L-R: Niall McCarroll , Councillor Darren OReilly and Saoirse Fanning and Sarah Jane OHara ."},{"url":null,"title":"showcase challenging new play holywell building","story":"CAPTION: Actors Paul ODoherty and Bernadette McFarland who will perform extracts from The Was is Now at the Holywell building on Bishop Street next Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"weeks foyle hospice draw result winner","story":"Winners in this weeks Foyle Hospice Draw are - £,, Karen Crumley£, Pauline Sheerin£, Vincent Deehan£, Thomas Bell£, Rosemary McGinley .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube nwrc students boogie beales youtuber takes tour across northern ireland","story":"CAPTION: Youtuber Adam Beales TheNewAdamb pictured with NWRC lecturer Carie Logue Houston, and students Joshua Curran Kelly, Erwin Paul Ytis, Tasha Grant, Warren McCook and Megan Harkin."},{"url":null,"title":"charity show raises 5000 for","story":"The Stand Up To Cancer show at Theatre Hafren in January.\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"Charity show raises £, for good causesLlanidloes Dragonettes \" \"   typemchtype\" Charity show raises £, for good causesThe show raised more than pound, for good causes\" \"   typemchtype\" Charity show raises £, for good causesThe show raised more than pound, for good causes\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"hay festival 2019 tickets now","story":"Twenty years of Julia Donaldsonrsquos lsquoThe Gruffalorsquo will be markeltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtd at this yearrsquoltspan classtruncate-full-screengts Hay Festival.

A Rhys OrsquoDonnell box kick was marginally long and carried back with interest before quick hands from Crosbie put his winger in for a superb try.The conversion left the game in the balance at -.The home side continued to dominate possession and territory and a Reaney penalty following a great breakdown turnover from skipper Aaron Cairns gave them a little breathing space.Old Belvedere, despite showing admirable invention, were guilty on occasion of overplaying and a series of errors meant they were pinned back in their own half.The bonus point score went to Cronin who drove over the line when Adair was held up just short and with  minutes to go Hinch looked certain of victory at -.A superb defensive effort then kept their Dublin opponents at bay in relative comfort until the th minute when the pressure eventually led to an overlap to leave the away side in with a chance of a draw as the game reached its final moments.However, in their desperation to run the ball out of defence and keep the game alive, Old Belvedere conceded a penalty which Reaney knocked over to clinch the win.That should have been the end of proceedings, but a penalty from a scrum led to another Belvo charge and they were awarded another penalty which Crosbie slotted with the last kick of the game to take two points back to Dublin.Ballynahinch continue their winning run and stand level with Old Wesley at the top of the table with two games to go.Ballynahinch Old Belvedere AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Best friends laid to rest after accident  ","story":"BEST friends Shane McAnallen and Martin Patterson were buried side by side on Saturday.The two men in their twenties died together in a car crash on the Carlingford to Omeath Road in the early hours of Monday, March .It is believed they died at the scene and that no other vehicle was involved.Mr McAnallen was from the Castlewellan area and Mr Patterson was from Bryansford.Their tragic deaths, and that of missing Newcastle woman Ruth Maguire who also died in Carlingford over the St Patrickrsquos holiday weekend, left the community numb with grief.A community candlelight vigil was held in Carlingford on Sunday night which was attended by representatives from the deceasedrsquos families and rescue and emergency services.All three were connected to Bryansford GAC mdash the young men were former under-age players while mother of three Ms Maguire was the clubrsquos under-age coach.Mr Patterson also played for a time with Ballynahinch RFC U-s.He and Ms Maguire were also connected to St Maryrsquos Primary School in Newcastle.Ms Maguirersquos children attend the school and she was active in the St Maryrsquos Parent Support Group while Mr Patterson was a fondly remembered past pupil of the school.Ms Maguire was also known through her work as a casual leisure attendant at Newcastle Centre and also as a nursing assistant at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry.The  year-old had been reported missing from a group of friends on a hen night while there were out socialising in Carlingford on Saturday.An extensive land and sea search was carried out on Sunday.On Monday, her body was recovered from the lough around the same time as the deaths of the young men became public.Mr McAnallen and Mr Patterson, also known as Marty Patt to friends, were laid to rest in separate ceremonies with many local people attending both services.A funeral for Mr McAnallen was held in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan early on Saturday morning.

local councils are being encouraged to provide financial support for the Air Ambulance Northern Ireland.The appeal has been issued by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who last month secured across-the-board political support from his Newry, Mourne and Down Council colleagues to provide funding to the service which plays a critical role across the district.It has been revealed that between August  and November last year, the air ambulance responded to  incidents across the council area.ldquoThe air ambulance is vital for people across the district, given its rural nature and attractions like the Mournes and Strangford Lough, Cllr Walke rsaid.The Rowallane politician recently visited the air ambulancersquos base outside Lisburn where he was joined by two of his party colleagues from Mid Ulster and Derry and Strabane Councils, both of which have agreed to provide financial support for the lesaving service.With three local authorities already on board, Cllr Walker hopes that the remaining eight Northern Ireland councils will provide financial support.He said while Stormont funds the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment, it should be picking up the remainder of the servicersquos running costs.He confirmed that Strangford MP Jim Shannon plans to raise this issue with Department of Health Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly.ldquoDown District is already a main user of the air ambulance service which has already helped save a number of lives, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoThe service relies heavily upon donations to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs and while this is welcome, I believe local councils and indeed the Department of Health needs to do more.Cllr Walker says while the air ambulance relies heavily upon public support, it also needs a sustainable funding stream to ensure it can continue to save lives and hopes this will be provided by the Department of Health.ldquoThe service is a key component of the emergency services and should not have to rely on charitable donations, he continued.ldquoGiven the costs to keep the service in the air, I believe all of the Provincersquos  councils, supported by the government department, have a role to play.Cllr Walker, who was recently made aware of the excellent work of the air ambulance when the crew responded to an emergency in Killyleagh when a woman was involved in an accident in Plantation Street, confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos financial contribution to the service will be agreed at a meeting of its

the iconic sweeping beam at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse near Killough is seeking a meeting with local politicians.The Lecale Lightkeepers want to meet face-to-face with Newry, Mourne and Down councillors to spell out why the beam must be retained and why the proposed LED replacement suggested by the Dublin-based Commissioner of Irish Lights is totally inadequate and unacceptable.Campaigners have also submitted a Freedom of Information request to the local authority for copies of all correspondence between the councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Department and the Commissionerrsquos office on the lighthouse issue.Last month, the local authority was heavily criticised for excluding the press and public from a meeting mdash billed as a workshop mdash involving councillors and representatives from the Commissionerrsquos office, including its most senior official, Captain Robert McCabe.The council subsequently confirmed the workshop, held at the local authorityrsquos headquarters in Downpatrick, was a ldquopreliminary information session for councillors and that prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for the future of the lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation would take place.The workshop lasted well over one hour but the report from the behind-closed-doors session which has been sent to councillors amounts to a paltry two and a half lines.Signicantly, the paper does not detail the questions put by councillors or, most importantly the response from Commissioner officials, compounding the frustration of those seeking to retain the beam.They are angry that the council report provides no detail whatsoever of what was discussed and simply states the issue of the lighthouse beam will be raised at district electoral forums across the district.Campaigners insist that as the Commissioner of Irish Lights had the opportunity to put its case before councillors, it is only right and proper and in keeping with equality legislation and good old fashioned fairness, that the Lecale Lightkeepers should be afforded the same opportunity.The campaigners have been exchanging correspondence with council officials and described one response confirming the sweeping beam issue will be discussed at ious district electoral forums with a view to having a joint meeting with Captain McCabe, which the public could also attend, as ldquodismissive and derogatory.The Lecale Lightkeepers have also vehemently rejected the councilrsquos view that a joint DEA meeting to put questions directly to representatives of the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be the ldquomost appropriate forum to address the issues they have raised.A spokesperson for the campaign group said councillors were keen to protect the iconic, sweeping beam, describing plans to remove the mercury bearing which rotates the Fresnel lamp due to health concerns as ldquoflimsy and flawed.They have also rejected claims that a new LED light proposed by the Commissioners would be the same, arguing this ldquosimply isnrsquot true.Campaigners say it is their understanding that some councillors are at a complete loss as to why the local authority is denying them a chance to meet all of the councilrsquos  members to state their case.They say Commissioners were in Downpatrick last month because councillors voted unanimously to invite them for a meeting to discuss the controversial plan to replace the sweeping beam with what, in their view, is a much inferior light.ldquoThe irony of what is happening is not lost on us, said the spokesperson for the campaign group.ldquoCouncillors discuss the issue of the sweeping beam and unanimously agree that it should be retained. They propose to meet with the Commissioners which happens but yet when campaigners ask to meet with all the districtrsquos elected representatives at one time, we are denied this opportunity. Why The spokesperson added: ldquoWe hope councillors will demand a detailed account of the recent workshop so the views of the Commissioners can be critically examined and scrutinised by not only campaigners, but elected representatives, to determinethey are accurate.ldquoIf, in our opinion they are not, we should be given an opportunity to refute them in front of councillors who were elected to represent the people of this district and who are accountable to them.ldquoIf changes are made at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse, the historic character of the sweeping beam will be lost forever. We must all stand together and ensure this does not happen. What is being offered by the Commissioner is inferior to what we currently have.A council spokesman said officers from the the Commissioner of Irish Lights will be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums.He explained this is to ensure that information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for St Johnrsquos Lighthouse in the immediate future before any plans are finalised.The spokesman added: ldquoRequests for details of future public consultations on plans for St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse would be best addressed by the Commissioner of Irish Lights..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar food sauce firm in deal with Aldi  ","story":"PREP House Sauces in Crossgar has won its first business with discount retailer Aldi in the Republic of Ireland.Prep House is a family business which has won a string of national awards for its original sauces and dressings.Itrsquos now supplying its pepper sauce to Aldi for its network of  stores across the Republic.Managing director Paul Bell, who took over the management reins of the company in , described the new deal as ldquoa marvellous boost.ldquoThis very important business for us resulted when we swtly followed up a lead from Invest NIrsquos Drew McIvor, he added.ldquoOur approach was well received by the Aldi buyer who was extremely interested and very supportive.

The Down sharp shooters lost their way and tried their luck from distance. The result was aimless, wayward shooting.Louth, who deservedly led - to - at half time, made a decisive burst with eight unanswered points either side of the break.Full forward Sam Mulroy bagged half their tally, all five of his points coming from frees, during that purple patch, with midfielders James Calfand Tommy Durnin also registering.With  minutes to go Louth led - to - and then came the Down revival, led by Darren OrsquoHagan who scored a goal and a point.The goal came after Donal OrsquoHarersquos initial shot was brilliantly kept in by Connaire Harrison. The ball fell to OrsquoHagan, who dummied and then fired his shot into the net.Harrison,who looked impressive,registered a great point and when Paul Devlin and then OrsquoHagan also pointed, the gap was down to a single score.Down, who had mounted a number of successful comebacks during the campaign, looked as though they were going to mount another great escape.But it was not to be.

I am confident that the completed public realm scheme will signicantly enhance the ambitious plans to develop a new retail and commercial centre at this part of Downpatrick.It was confirmed recently that the former police base will not be bulldozed as part of the ambitious multi-million pound plan to regenerate this part of the town.The building mdash which enjoys protected status mdash is to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project which, in addition to new retail and commercial space, could also include an element of housing provision.Council officials insist the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and view preserving the former station as an opportunity and a challenge, insisting it very much remains part of the overall development project and potentially could be utilised as an attractive entrance feature.To date, senior retailers including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in opening new premises at the proposed retail complex which will be built on a huge area of land stretching back as as far as St Patrickrsquos Avenue.A council spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that while the public realm works were scheduled to complete on March , a utilities company was required to undertake work in Irish Street before the public realm contractor was able to get on site.She added: ldquoDue to unforeseen circumstances experienced by the utilities company on site which required their attention, it resulted in a delay to the completion date of the overall public realm scheme. It is anticipated now that the public realm scheme will be completed before the end of April..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 27%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick was in the middle of a rubbish tangle this week with unemptied bins and litter boxes left piled in housing estates and on many of the townrsquos footpaths.High winds and scavenging dogs added to the problem as waste became strewn over large areas.Council bin collections were running behind schedule from anything between one day and five days and angry housewives and traders were left wondering what had gone wrong.The worst affected areas were Scotch Street and Irish Street where shoppers had to walk on roadways to avoid the piles of rubbish.Callers to the Recorder claimed that phone queries to the council offices were either ldquofobbed off or nobody was prepared to talk to them.Traffic to the townrsquos main dump at Inch was a steady trickle throughout Monday as traders and domestic ratepayers carried out their own disposal.Domestic collections have been so erratic, particularly in the last ten days, that people now do not know when to leave out their bins for collection.Mr Seamus Byrne, Down Council clerk and chief executive, told the Recorder what had gone wrong and promised that normal schedules should be resumed later this week.He explained that bin crews were on holiday on Monday of last week, but for the remainder of the week only half the Downpatrick crew turned in for work, the others having booked off sick.CROSSGAR mdash A former Crossgar man is making plans for a daring world recored crossing of the North Atlantic in a  feet rowing boat.Twenty-seven year-old Kenneth Kerr, formerly from Drumaghlis, will head out from St Johnrsquos, Newfoundland, and will cross , miles of sea to the west coast of Ireland.

He said that in addition to the trauma of suddenly losing a young child, they now faced the added pressure of having to have their child flown to England for post-mortem.Mr McGrath said it was his understanding that the issue impacted on around  families a year, highlighting the importance of doing everything possible for families.ldquoThere are a number of considerations here, suggested Mr McGrath. ldquoWe have to consider the period of time to conclude the post-mortem andthe child to their family for burial.ldquoI am very heartened to hear that the present model involving Liverpool is maintaining the turnaround times. What is also of the utmost importance is supporting the childrsquos family and I am glad to hear that there are bereavement support teams here for families.Mr McGrath added: ldquoThis is not going to be an easy process, however what is absolutely vital is that we get the right long term solution and my colleagues and I will be pressing the government department for that.ldquoCllr Trainor and I met departmental officials to ascertain how we can progress matters for the peace of mind of families here.Explaining the background to sending babies to Liverpool for post-mortem, Cllr Trainor said the paediatric pathologist who was involved in carrying out these procedures in Belfast moved from his current post and there was no one available to fill the position.ldquoFrom our meeting, it is apparent that there is a shortage here of paediatric pathologists and this is why the link with Liverpool has been implemented as a short term solution, he said.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoThe Department of Health is also looking at the possibility of an all island approach. However, such a process would take some time to develop as we look at the possibility of a standardised level of care between north and south.Local health campaigners are also seeking a meeting with senior health chiefs to discuss the issue of child post-mortems being held in Liverpool.The Down Community Health Committee believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.At one of its recent meetings, Mrs Anne Trainor, suggested that the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.She described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child. For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.

The DUP believes the backstop section of the proposed treaty would create trade barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and, over time, weaken the union.Because of its confidence and supply deal with the Tory party and its ten MPs, it holds a signicant balance of power in the process, much to its critics’ disdain.In a statement Mr Dodds said: “The Democratic Unionist Party has consistently and repeatedly indicated that we could not support the Withdrawal Agreement because of the construction of the backstop. We have reached this view from a principled position as we do not believe the withdrawal agreement is the best way forward for the United Kingdom.We have encouraged the Government to do, as Dominic Raab has said, toto Brussels on these issues and not simply to accept the position of the European Union as being unalterable.“We have said that were the backstop to become operational Northern Ireland would sit in a separate legal position from the rest of the United Kingdom in economic and trade terms.“In those circumstances there is the strong possibility that we could have a long-term outcome whereby Northern Ireland would inevitably pull away from its biggest trading market in Great Britain as there would be new internal barriers within the United Kingdom.“In our recent discussions with the Government good progress has been made on how domestic legislation would assist in ensuring the economic integrity of the UK as a whole and recognising Northern Ireland’s particular situation sharing a land border with the European Union.“However, regretfully the fact remains that sufficient progress has not been made.“We have encouraged the Government to do, as Dominic Raab has said, toto Brussels on these issues and not simply to accept the position of the European Union as being unalterable. The Government must use the remaining time to deal with widely held concerns across the House of Commons.”He added: “The United Kingdom’s long-term relationship with the European Union will need to accord with our key objectives to ensure the economic integrity of the United Kingdom.”“We deeply regret the numerous missed opportunities by those who negotiated on behalf of the UK to listen to our warnings about the dangers of the backstop and to take steps to remedy those deficiencies.”Jayda Fransen guilty of racial hatred offences in Northern IrelandChildren on roof of Co Armagh flats branded ‘crazy’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Sinn Féin said it is to meet EU leaders to insist that the treaty is not reopened.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said: “Today we again witnessed British political circus at Westminster and as a result we now moving closer to a no-deal crash-out Brexit.“Westminster has rejected for a third time the Withdrawal Agreement which includes minimum safeguards for Ireland, North and South. “The EU has made clear that this agreement will not be reopened, renegotiated or its protections reduced.“The behaviour of the DUP has been reckless and outrageous. “They have been seduced by the games at Westminster at the cost of farmers, the economy and the views of the majority in the north.”Sinn Féin will be travelling to Brussels on Monday to meet with Michel Barnier and other European leaders to press the case that in a “crash out Brexit” the EU must continue to act “in the interests of all Ireland”.SDLP Brexit Spokesman Daniel McCrossan MLA has said that the Government should now request a long extension to the Article  process.The West Tyrone MLA said that a two week timeline is not enough to substantially alter negotiations and that it was “time to face up to the fact that this iteration of Brexit is dead in the water”. He added: “What’s needed now is a long extension to the Article  period for all parties to calmly and rationally reflect on where we go from here. The grotesque political circus at Westminster needs to stop.”TUV leader Jim Allister said he welcomed “the further defeat of the Deal of Betrayal” and called for a no-deal Brexit.He said: “Instead of further national humiliation, which comes from more grovelling to Brussels and awaiting their next decision on our future, the Government should proceed without deflection to conclude preparations for leaving on World Trade terms on  April. That’s what we should have done today, but the ongoing attempts to thwart Brexit only brought us to another impasse.“It remains correct that no deal is better than a bad deal, which Mrs May’s concoction of vassalage most certainly is.”try catch  TrendingTeen whose body was found at Belfast hospital is namedTeenage girl found dead beside car in vicinity of Belfast City HospitalNI road

That dubious title has been taken by Burnley couples, who spent just £ - the the least out of the whole UK, followed by Wigan and Bradford.Belfast was tenth in the study, although had one of the highest average salaries out of the bottom ten, showing that local romantics are frugal with their money.Romantics in London are the biggest spenders, paying an average of £ for an engagement ring, while Oxford was second in the list at £,, and Edinburgh third at £,.The average cost of a wedding ring in the UK in  was £,, and while still considered the etiquette,the old tradition of spending two months salary on the lelong investment is being increasingly ignored in these days of austerity and Brexit uncertainty .And increasingly couples are considering other factors such as where the diamond in the ring may have come from, and whether they should go for a diamond at all.The new data was compiled by national antique silverware and jewellery outlet AC Silver, who analysed the price of engagement rings purchased through its site from customers across the UK over the past five years.Andrew Campbell, founder of AC Silver said: “Much pressure is placed on iniduals when planning a proposal, including finding the ‘perfect ring’.“We believe wherever your location and whatever your budget, you should be able to treat your special someone to a stunning ring.

leader of the D.U.P. in the House of Commons, Nigel Dodds M.P., Prime Minister, Theresa May and Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn. The result of the crunch vote means that the UK has missed an EU deadline to secure an extension of the Brexit process and leave with a deal on May .Mrs May now has until April  to go back to Brussels with new proposals and seek a longer extension to the negotiation process, or see the UK leave without a deal that day.With a clear majority in the Commons against no-deal, and with MPs once more seizing control of the timetable on Monday, Mrs May said that the UK would have to find \"an alternative way forward\".This was \"almost certain\" to involve the UK having to stage elections to the European Parliament in May, she said.Mrs May said that the outcome was \"a matter of profound regret\"DUP’s Nigel Dodds: third rejection of Brexit deal shows Brussels must change treaty Coremetrics

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time.

At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In  the organisation became Reconciliation, Education and Community Training .Over the last  years under her guidancethe organisation has developed and changed from a single identity group to cross community. With the aim of supporting the community and developing programmes to meet their needs it has a core ethos of accepting and respecting people regardless of their background. REACT’s journey through the last  years is a true reflection of the peace process at a community level and Marions dedication to the promotion of good relations.Never afraid to take risks she has worked with others from erse backgrounds in the community to address some of the most contentious issues faced by those who work in the field of community relations.She believes that only through dialogue can dferences be resolved — something which she has demonstrated time and again through her work with loyalist bands.“There are hundredsof parades which pass off peacefully and only a very few which don’t,” she said. “Planning and talking and taking a rational approach have worked for all the areas through the band forums.”Charmain Jones has worked as a Community Relations Officer with Rural CommunityNetworkin Cookstown for over eight years. Charmain currently works with a number of dferent communities on both a single identity and cross community basis.Charmain’s journey in community development and community relations has spanned  years. She first started working for local grass roots organisations both in Portadown and Armagh and now has a regional remit based in RCN offices in Cookstown. Charmain has worked tirelessly to address issues facing iniduals, communities and wider society and is fully committed and passionate in relation to her work. Five years ago Charmain organised a shared history event that became a turning point for her in supporting local communities to truly explore their shared history and heritage. This medium really worked for participants who reported that the approach helped them understand common values. Putting shared history and heritage in the spotlight contributed to and reinforced a sense of belonging.SDLP election posters vandalised Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Since then Charmain has been engaged in numerous shared history courses, workshops and school programmes across rural NI. This work has been recognised by CRC and the Heritage Lottery Fundas a model of good practice. The approach needs almost constant innovation to create new programmes and share ideas with communities that are resistant to change and engage them in good relations projects.It’s no surprise that Marion and Charmain have and continue to collaborate on many projects and are respected and admired by participants and funders alike.Marion Jamison said: “I’m honoured to receive this award from the Community Relations Council. It is so important that community leaders work in the nooks and crannies of local communities to help people who are dealing with so many dficult issues. “Focussing our workon the grass roots level has meant that we have also been able to contribute ideas and approaches that are now being used outside the local communities that we live and work in. “I am proud that the work that I have been able to do with Charmain and others has made and will continue to make a positive impact across Northern Ireland.”Charmain Jones said: “Much thanks goes to my family, friends and colleagues who support me in the work that I am doing. The work that community relations practitioners do is challenging and time intensive. It requires a constant level of innovation and creativity to engage people at the local level. “Helping local people and testing out local approaches is vital to delivering good models of community relations practice. “It’s a real honour to receive this award with my friend and colleague Marion Jamison. We have worked hard together to overcome many challenges in the delivery of good relations work and I look forward to the exciting work we will continue to deliver into the future.”try catch  TrendingPrayers for local family of Greenvale victim \"Concern for missing N.I. girl - P.S.N.I. issue emergency appealCookstown tragedy funerals: The funeral of -year-old Lauren Bullock has taken place at St Patrickrsquos Church in Donaghmore, Co.

Translinks chief executive, Chris Conway welcomed the decision and would \"take around  years to complete is a further milestone in the transformation of public transport in Northern Ireland. It is hugely important as the main transport gateway, with rail, coach and bus connections to all parts of Northern Ireland and beyond\". “It will provide over  direct jobs during construction as well as additional longer term investment and job opportunities,\" he said. “As a catalyst for the regeneration of the local area, the plans will play a key role in positioning Belfast as a modern, confident and progressive city supporting the City Councils Belfast Agenda. “We have seen strong passenger growth in recent years with a record  million passenger journeys last year, the highest in  years.  This modern, innovative Transport Hub will allow us to build on this success, to meet growing customer demand, increase transport connectivity and enhance the customer experience as even more people choose to use public transport. “There is widespread support across the local community, businesses, city stakeholders and political parties, and we are delighted that this project has been given the green light. “We look forward to getting this ‘transport led regeneration’ project underway, in order to meet the future needs of commuters, visitors and residents in Northern Ireland.  We will continue to work with all our stakeholders as the development progresses.\" It is estimated the project could support up to  jobs during construction.

The firm behind it says  jobs could be supported during the build, with  full-time roles once it’s operational. Work is expected to start in autumn, with the plant up-and-running by  Ciaran Devine, director of Belfast Power Limited said the green light comes at a “critical time for Northern Ireland’s electricity industry, and the power station will play a central role in ensuring we have enough electricity to meet demand over the coming years. “The project also represents a signicant sht towards low-carbon electricity generation in Northern Ireland. Using state-of-the-art Siemens technology, it will be the most efficient of its kind anywhere in the UK and Ireland. “This is good news as we continue the journey towards decarbonisation and will ensure competitive costs, which will benefit consumers. “At a time of considerable uncertainty, we’re proud to be bringing this level of investment to Belfast, which will result in the creation of over  full-time jobs when construction begins and over  full-time roles when the plant is operational. “DfI has been thoroughly professional in its approach to the application since it was submitted in April .

Which makes it even more impressive that, in that time, he’s also managed to start and scale up one of the great business success stories in Northern Ireland, David Meade Events. Known for his skills as a mentalist and speaker, David also runs the company which delivers cutting-edge corporate events, learning and development workshops, and offers keynote speaking services. It has achieved double figure growth every year since its establishment in  working not only in UK and Irish markets, but also internationally. Asked how he had ersied into events and keynote speaking from being an on-stage mentalist, David says: “I’ve actually been delivering events and keynote speeches very successfully in the UK and Ireland for a number of years, but I suppose most people know me for my tours and the more corporate side of my business was lesser known. “I moved into this space roughly seven years ago because I love inspiring and motivating people and it was a natural move to work with companies who want to inspire their teams to be innovative and the best they can be.” David believes there are even more opportunities outside our region and this year the company is investing over £, to take advantage of them. This includes investing in new video learning services, enabling people to access David’s bespoke training services remotely, from wherever they are in the world. “Over the last number of years, the company has grown at a phenomenal rate and this latest investment was a no-brainer because we simply had to respond to that growth.” David says: “We are still based in Northern Ireland, but there is a huge untapped market that we want to explore further. The world is getting smaller because of technology and we want to meet the challenge and work with people all across the globe. So far in  we have contracts in  countries, including Dubai, Singapore and Switzerland and many more are in the pipeline.” David’s list of international clients reads like a who’s who of the biggest and most impressive organisations in the world including Apple, Hard, Mercedes Benz, Adobe, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, British Airways and Canon. David attributes his company’s success and ability to attract such high-level clients to its ability to adapt and innovate in response to the market. “If the uncertainty of today’s marketplace teaches us anything, it’s that you must evolve and that’s what we’re doing – keeping up with the ever-changing market and meeting the ever-increasing demands, both in Northern Ireland and across the globe.” One of the company’s most exciting innovations has been the development of a bespoke in-house video production studio. This has greatly enhanced its capacity to produce media projects for its clients. Allowing clients to access the bespoke training remotely means the firm can compete all over the globe. This view of the company, as competing on an international stage, is a vital part of David’s approach to business and informs the business decisions he makes, including this recent quarter of a million-pound investment. He explains “The investment in our video learning service means we can deliver training to clients in any corner of the world, at any time. Thinking of ourselves as part of a global economy, rather than just the Northern Ireland economy has been key to shting the company up a gear.” He has grown to a team of  and this year the company is expected to achieve a turnover of £m, an impressive milestone for any company but something David considers not a destination or even a point to slow down, but simply a  to push on to bigger and better things. “As the company continues to thrive and grow every year, I find myself looking at new and innovative ways to keep up with demand. Hitting that £m milestone will be energising and whilst I’m proud of the work my team have done here, I’m already thinking ‘OK, what’s next ’ With this investment, our ability to evolve and the international demand for the services we provide, there’s so much more we can do.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn1.jpg","title":"high street in need of leadership to ensure its future","story":"Posted on Monday  March  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland retailers are increasingly frustrated that a lack of government means key areas of reform aren’t being looked at. John Mulgrew speaks to retail experts about the challenges of the high street If there’s one thing Northern Ireland is good at, it’s kicking the can down the road. Again. And while the ongoing political flux at home is being trumped by Brexit, crucial areas of business reform, especially in regards to the ever-evolving retail landscape, aren’t being addressed.And even since the fundamental review and reform of the business rates system was last discussed On the Hill, Northern Ireland and the wider retail landscape has changed further still – with national retailers going to the wall, or narrowly avoiding going bust.“In  our retail sector is in for its fastest ever period of change and reinvention,” Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI says. “This is equally the case for our high streets and town centres.“This change will not all be good, as we will see some more signicant large retail casualties in . However, we will also see the creation of more confident and dynamic independent retailers, who will be at the forefront of a new retail sector, leading toward st century town high streets.”As for the big names facing tough times, HMV called in the administrators once again, while House of Fraser was bought out of administration by Sports Direct’s Mike Ashley – a recent fresh lease with the owners of Belfast’s Victoria Square shopping centre securing the only Northern Ireland outlet’s future for the foreseeable future.“It is nothing less than disgraceful that we start a second New Year with no Government in place in Northern Ireland, with not even a date set for all-party talks,” Glyn says.“This is hugely disruptive for the economy and Northern Ireland is in danger of becoming an international laughing stock.“With much-needed decisions not being made on reform of business rates, infrastructure investment, addressing an ever-growing skills gap and modernisation of our town centres, Northern Ireland is not just lagging behind the rest of the UK and Ireland, it is in real danger of being left behind internationally.”Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says there needs to be a fundamental review of the business rates system.“Retail is % of the economy but pays almost a quarter of rates – that is not tenable,” he says. “The structural change in retail is not reflected in the business rates system and we need to widen the tax base.“Stormont being down is a problem, as it affects decisions on business rates and apprenticeship levy, plus the changing face of retail, and a lack of legislation to protect shop workers from abuse and violence.”Meanwhile, Northern Ireland’s councils are raising business rates, from the smallest rise in Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council, at .%, to the inflation-busting hike of .% from Derry  Strabane District Council. “There is the very real possibility that they will only find out what the regional rate — and their total rates liability — will be the week before those business rates bills hit their doormats,” Aodhan says.Hospitality Ulster’s Colin Neill says the lack of a Government in Northern Ireland is costing the sector millions and damaging the potential for future growth — sighting the lack of progress to modernise liquor licensing as one of its major contributors to the losses.A Liquor Licensing Bill was one of the few pieces of legislation the Assembly had introduced at that time, but the collapse of Stormont killed the Bill, which set out to address the laws.Overall figures point to a mixed bag for the high streets in general. For example Northern Ireland shops in January defied a UK trend slump to rise by almost %, but shop vacancy rates have crept up to %. gtBelfast itself is still recovering from its high street disaster, following the firm at Primark’s Bank Buildings. That led to a city centre drop in footfall of more than a third, while businesses in and around the cordon felt a more considerable drop.“Consumer behaviour is rapidly changing, and people want something dferent from their high streets and I believe that smaller, more agile and tech-savvy retailers who can adapt to this tidal wave of change, will be the ones who will not just survive, but thrive,” Glyn Roberts says.“Government also needs to reboot its policy agenda for the retail sector and for our town centres to meet the challenges ahead.“While devolution remains in limbo, our eleven councils have been doing their level best to fill the gap and provide leadership, despite not having the full ranges of powers to make the real economic changes within their communities.“Retail NI is an organisation working across all  councils, contributing to each of their consultations on local development plans and assisting our members with planning and town centre regeneration.“Local government elections take place in May and Retail NI has already hit the ground running with the publication of our detailed report, ‘Regeneration NI’, which sets out a comprehensive plan to create st century town and city centres. “The regeneration of our town and city centres needs to be the top priority of our local councils and we will be engaging with them and the political parties ahead of the elections.“The Belfast Region and Derry city deals offer huge opportunities for economic, social and infrastructural regeneration for our two main cities and many of our local towns. It is hoped the Belfast Region City Deal will create up to , new and better jobs, alongside delivering a -year programme of inclusive economic growth – including an increase of £m Gross Value Added .”“ will truly be the year of retail reinvention that will see Northern Ireland’s largest sector of industry, perhaps being slightly smaller but more agile, nevertheless a sector, which is vital to the future of our local economy’.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"stormont departments compiling emergency no deal brexit contingency list","story":"Posted on Wednesday  March  by John Mulgrew Stormont departments are building a key list of emergency contacts across business and the wider sectors amid contingency planning for a ‘no deal’ Brexit, Ulster Business can reveal.

It’s understood Bullhouse Brewing Company, currently based in Newtownards, wants to turn a former menswear store on the Newtowards Road into its new brewhouse. The planning application has been made by Landmark East – a company owned by the East Belfast Partnership. It’s been submitted to Belfast City Council for a change of use from retail, to a micro-brewery. Plans show the building, which is around , sq ft, would include a brewing area, storage and a ‘gallery display’ section towards the front of the building. It’s understood the expansion of Bullhouse would see the east Belfast site becoming its new home. The application includes a change of use from “retail unitto micro-brewerywith gallery display space and provision of new external doors, roller shutter in yard wall and forming ramp in yard”. The building at - Newtownards Road had been placed on the market by property firm OKT. It sits close to a range of shopping areas, including Connswater Shopping Centre and Retail Park, whose occupants include Argos, BM Bargains, Lidl and McDonald’s. Bullhouse Brewing began when owner William Mayne got into beer during a trip to the US in . Following that, he began home-brewing, before setting up Bullhouse in . It produces a range of beers, including a core range of a pale ale and IPA, but has also produced brews such as an imperial milk stout, and a double IPA, called Big Axe. It began in a former bull pen on a family farm near Newtownards, and in September , Mr Mayne gave up his day job to concentrate on the brewery full–time, celebrating the occasion by brewing a pale ale called P. The move to east Belfast would expand the area’s craft beer credentials. Not far from the proposed Bullhouse site is Boundary Brewing, located at Portview Trade Centre. The co-operative brewery, founded by Belfast man Matthew Dick, sells a core range of beers, and a wide-range one of one offs, such as barrel-aged stouts, sour beers and double IPAs, and also hosts a regular taproom at the brewery. Mr Dick sets the brewery up after raising more than a £, in just a few days through crowd-funding.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
