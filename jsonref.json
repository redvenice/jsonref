I cannot wrap my head around these accusations.\u0027Stranger Things actress Ryder was in a relationship with Depp during the early 1990s, and he famously tattooed \u0027Winona Forever\u0027 on his arm – before changing it to \u0027Wino Forever\u0027 following their split.What Depp is being questioned about at the High Court during the libel caseDepp has been questioned since Tuesday over 14 alleged domestic violence incidents, and his Hollywood lifestyle, past relationships with Ryder, Vanessa Paradis and Kate Moss, and his well-documented use of drink and drugs. The court has heard disputed accounts of a three-day trip to Australia, when Depp lost the top of his middle finger, and the so-called \u0027defecation incident\u0027 in which faeces were found in the couple\u0027s bed after Heard\u0027s 30th birthday.Depp finished giving evidence today after around 25 hours in the witness box at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. NGN\u0027s lawyers have said Depp first hit his ex-wife in early 2013 during a heated argument over a painting - which he allegedly tried to set alight - by Heard\u0027s ex Tasya van Ree and attacked her on a number of other occasions before the couple split in May 2016.The publisher claims Depp is a \u0027Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\u0027 character who snapped when he was drunk and on drugs and turned into \u0027the Monster\u0027 - an \u0027alter ego\u0027 he assumed when he would \u0027lose control and become a violent thug\u0027.The Pirates Of The Caribbean star has admitted giving misleading evidence about his drink and drug use before a flight from Boston to LA in May 2014 and \u0027accidentally\u0027 headbutting Heard during a row at their home in December 2015, but says his ex-wife\u0027s allegations are \u0027complete lies\u0027 and that she was \u0027the abuser\u0027 in the relationship.He accuses Heard of severing the top of his middle finger with a vodka bottle in Australia in March 2015 and of \u0027building a dossier very early on\u0027 in their relationship to align herself with the #MeToo movement.The court also heard evidence last week on Friday afternoon from LAPD officer Melissa Saenz who attended the couple\u0027s penthouse after the actor allegedly hit Heard in the face with her own mobile phone in May 2016, who said she \u0027did not see any injuries\u0027 or damage to the apartment.Paradis, 47, and Ryder, 48, were originally due to give evidence this week, as was alleged Harvey Weinstein victim Katherine Kendall, 50, who accuses Mr Wootton of \u0027deliberately misusing\u0027 her quotes and \u0027using the #MeToo movement\u0027 to damage Depp.Heard\u0027s evidence was expected to begin on Friday morning - but it is not clear when the Aquaman actress will give evidence as Depp\u0027s cross-examination has taken almost two days longer than scheduled.The three-week trial, which is due to finish on July 27, will also hear evidence from current and former employees of Depp and Heard, as well as her sister and friends by video-link from LA.The actor is suing NGN and Mr Wootton over the publication of an article on April 27 2018 with the headline: \u0027Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be \u0027genuinely happy\u0027 casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?\u0027NGN is defending the article as true, and says Depp was \u0027controlling and verbally and physically abusive towards Heard, particularly when he was under the influence of alcohol andor drugs\u0027."},{"url":null,"title":"Start recovery UK economy grew 1 8 cent May","story":"Share this article Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, he outlined the \u0027exceptional economic shock\u0027 the UK had suffered during the pandemic.\u0027The global financial crisis saw GDP fall by around 5 per cent at its trough.

It is unclear if it was triggered by the coronavirus.The baby was also large for her age, a complication of her mother\u0027s diabetes during pregnancy.At first she appeared healthy — other than being premature, when she was taken to the neonatal intensive care unit.But doctors were aware she could have been exposed to the coronavirus, which is scientifically called SARS-CoV-2, via her mother. On the day after she was born, medics discovered her vitals had changed. She had mild difficulties breathing as well as a fever. The doctors said it was unlikely that the respiratory distress was due to the fact she had been born premature, considering it did not start for 24 hours. She tested positive for the coronavirus and was treated with supplemental oxygen for several days but did not need mechanical ventilation. Covid-19 tests remained positive for up to 14 days. At 21 days, the mother and infant were sent home in good condition. The researchers examined the placenta, which showed signs of tissue inflammation. They also found the specific coronavirus proteins in the cells of the placenta.Together, these findings \u0027strongly suggest\u0027 that the infection was transmitted in the womb, rather than during or after birth, doctors said. This is medically called \u0027utero transmission\u0027, and experts have said the passing of the coronavirus this was was probable for some time.\u0027We wanted to be very careful of our interpretation of this data, but now is an even more important time for pregnant women to protect themselves from Covid-19,\u0027 Dr Evans said.  The report, led by Dr Julide Sisman, detailed two other cases of \u0027vertical transmission\u0027 of the coronavirus, which is when it would pass immediately before or after birth and not in the wombThe authors said it is difficult to determine at which point a baby with the coronavirus picked it up.The new case report is the \u0027strongest evidence to date\u0027 that uterine transmission is possible, the press release from journal publishers Wolters Kluwer said.It follows a small study in Italy which also found pregnant woman infected with the coronavirus may be able to spread it to unborn babies.Researchers studied 31 women with Covid-19, who gave birth between March and April. Two babies tested positive for the virus.They found signs of the coronavirus in several samples of umbilical cord blood, the placenta and, in one case, breast milk.In one case, \u0027there\u0027s strong evidence suggesting that the newborn was born already positive because we found the virus in the umbilical cord blood and in the placenta,\u0027 said study leader, Dr Claudio Fenizia, an immunology specialist at the University of Milan.However, he said women shouldn\u0027t panic because the virus detected in the placenta and other areas isn\u0027t necessarily viable - in other words \u0027catching\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s too early to make guidelines,\u0027 Dr Fenizia said at an online medical conference, according to the news agency AP."},{"url":null,"title":"Where buy make mask mandatory July 24","story":" It\u0027s too early for there to be reliable data on how well they prevent infection with COVID-19, but the study found the thinner, cheaper masks do work in flu outbreaks.The difference between surgical or face masks and N95 masks lies in the size of particles that can - and more importantly, can\u0027t - get though the materials.N95 respirators are made of thick, tightly woven and molded material that fits tightly over the face and can stop 95 percent of all airborne particles, while surgical masks are thinner, fit more loosely, and more porous.This makes surgical masks much more comfortable to breathe and work in, but less effective at stopping small particles from entering your mouth and nose.Droplets of saliva and mucous from coughs and sneezes are very small, and viral particles themselves are particularly tiny - in fact, they\u0027re about 20-times smaller than bacteria. Experts universally agree that there\u0027s simply no replacement for thorough, frequent hand-washing for preventing disease transmission. Share this article"},{"url":null,"title":"Government announces major Huawei U turn bans firm UKs 5G network","story":"Share this article \u0027I believe that MPs will have concerns about elements of the statement, including no ban on 3G and 4G and a rip-out date for 5G far into the distance,\u0027 he said in a statement.\u0027It does mean Huawei\u0027s glide path out of our critical national infrastructure will be slow.

Jenny Stallard speaks to salon owner Melissa Timperley and pub chain boss Helen Charlesworth to find out how they’re keeping staff and customers safeMelissa Timperley is used to the demands of her clients as a salon owner. As a “treat” destination, she knows that everything – from the friendly welcome and the gown she puts around a customer’s shoulders, to the chocolate with their coffee – makes a visit to her eponymous hair salon a luxurious experience.And that isn’t changing just because of lockdown rules – in salons, restaurants, bars and shops, owners want their customers to feel special as they reopen in the “new normal”.Based in Manchester, Timperley’s three-floor salon recently had a makeover of its own, becoming a place of tape measures and screens, with every area considered for adaptation, from the reception desk to the basins, as it prepared to reopen.“I think salon owners have two really important jobs,” says Timperley. “They have, first and foremost, to keep their staff healthy and happy, and then they’ve got the job of keeping every single client healthy and happy.”Her first step was to see what other countries had been doing, in advance of any UK guidance. “The whole of lockdown has been a rollercoaster of emotions for most people, you have great days and bad days, and things get overwhelming. We researched what a lot of other countries were doing before our guidelines even came out,” says Timperley.Then, when the UK government did announce its own rules, specifically for England, it was a case of acting swiftly and safely to make some key decisions that worked for customers and staff. As the online appointment book filled up, she worked hard to make the salon accessible while still keeping that luxury feel.For Timperley, that has meant installing hand sanitiser stations and ordering new gowns. There will be branded face masks for those who want to wear them, although customers are not obliged to since staff will wear visors.There’s a huge emphasis on loyalty in the industry, where customers have been patient while they wait for news of appointments, and salon owners like Timperley want to show that’s appreciated, while also making sure her staff feel safe, too.“You’ve got to show that you’re doing the best for everybody. That means buying the best equipment, not cutting any corners,” she says. “We’ve staggered the appointments, we’re opening longer hours and we’re even opening on a Sunday to be able to service all our regular clients who’ve waited for us.”When the UK government announced that non-essential businesses in England could reopen on 4 July, many people were more than ready for a hair appointment, which shows the impact of not having these services around.Different salons needed to adapt in different ways. At Melissa Timperley, there is no “sharing” of clients, but at other salons that’s often not the case. For example, you may have visited a hairdresser and had your hair washed by one assistant, your cut done by your stylist and then the blow dry by another. Timperley’s salon has always been one-on-one with customers, which helped post-lockdown planning, as that needed to become the norm for all salons, according to UK government guidance.It’s a familiar scenario not just in salons but in pubs and restaurants across the country – wanting customers to feel valued and welcomed and staff to feel safe and appreciated, too – all while sticking to the guidelines laid out by the UK government.For Helen Charlesworth, managing director of the Stonegate pub company – which owns the Slug and Lettuce chain, among others – opening up has also been a “one day at a time” process. For the duration of lockdown, each day was one where she and the team planned for a future where they could reopen.Helping staff feel connected was a priority, she says, and a lot of time also went into ensuring the chain had a robust “closedown” manual. “We’ve never in our time had to close down an entire pub chain before. So we learned quite a lot, and we felt it would be good to document our learnings and have a precise manual. I’m glad we did as we’ve had to activate that in Leicester,” she adds, referring to the city that became subject to the UK’s first local lockdown on 30 June.The company furloughed a lot of team members, and then faced the task of ensuring their mental and physical health was kept in good shape. “We communicated with our people every day throughout the lockdown process, then once they went on to furlough we’ve had a very robust communication programme led by our CEO Simon Longbottom. He’s done twice weekly calls with the teams, video calls, kept everyone abreast of what’s going on.“We’ve had various groups raising money for charity. Lots of teams of people within Stonegate who have felt looked after and felt part of the Stonegate family have been out there raising cash for employees and families affected by Covid-19, the NHS and charities,” explains Charlesworth.Stonegate has an intranet hub where it could upload everything from key messages to quizzes and games. “Hundreds of different articles and things you can do whilst you’re off and we kept that updated,” adds Charlesworth.Keeping in touch with staff, both Charlesworth and Timperley agree, was key during lockdown so they felt valued and knew what was happening with the business.And what about the rules when the doors do open? Your haircut or that fancy G\u0026ampT will now come with a side serving of screens and socially-distanced chairs.“Customers don’t have to book a slot, but we are taking bookings in all our pubs, just so that people have got somewhere to come in and sit down and it’s easier because then we’re capturing customer data at the booking point,” says Charlesworth.“If you come to the pub and you haven’t booked, you’ll have to scan a QR code and put your details on to a website and we have to keep those details for 21 days,” she says.“The wonderful thing about hospitality, it’s pretty much a vocation rather than a job for people and it’s their way of life, and their customers end up being their friends, so it is quite sad and difficult for them to be at home and not be part of that. When they have come back it’s like walking into the unknown.”Part of the reopening has been a video filmed in one of Stonegate’s Manchester venues, showing staff how things would look and operate. “What we’ve done is we’ve tried to take away any level of anxiety,” she explains.The distancing has depended on which areas they were dealing with, she adds.“Where it’s outside we’ve tried to stick to a 2-metre rule, whereas when it’s inside we’ve tried to use screens, PPE and back-to-back tables. We’ve tried to be a bit more strategic and play around with what the layout looks like. We’ve spoken to all our authorities and they seem pretty happy with what we’ve done.”Hair salons, restaurants and pubs may be something you take for granted. Well, took for granted. Now they’re reopening, operators such as Timperley and Charlesworth feel this is their chance to showcase their new, and often improved, offerings.Timperley says: “Everything that we’ve had to do differently, we’ve done better. For example, the disposable towels are the nicest I could get, and the gowns are scented with vanilla. We’ve tried to keep the luxury touches and as soon as we can introduce more back in, even if we can do a coffee in a disposable cup, that would make it feel nicer again. But I think people will just be so grateful to have their hair done, you know ... what I think has happened is people have tried cutting their hair at home and colouring their hair at home, and they realise how talented hairdressers are!“I think the biggest challenge has been remaining positive in lockdown when everything around you is negative. For me, keeping the staff upbeat and the clients informed. Everything has been extra work.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

The government should be seizing this opportunity and taking action to rid these factories and many other workplaces around the country of exploitation.Instead, the weekend brought us reports of Priti Patel comparing the situation in Leicester to the Rotherham grooming scandal, suggesting that “cultural sensitivities” were the reason why the endemic abuse had not been tackled. This sounds like an attempt to distract us from the policy failures that have led us here, to a country in which more than 10,000 potential victims of modern slavery were identified in 2019, and everyday products have exploitation in their supply chains.Employers push abusive working conditions on to workers for one very simple reason: to make more money. In this way, it’s an opportunistic act. So, very simply, we need to remove the opportunity. How do we do that? There are three clear ways: properly funded labour inspection, ensuring reporting abuse is safe for migrant workers, and strong unionisation. None of them involve cultural sensitivities, and government has been asked for them repeatedly over the years.We can’t expect to have decent workplaces without proper enforcement of our labour laws. For too long, labour inspection has been portrayed as busybody interference or “red tape”. This narrative allows government to get away with shameful underfunding of our inspectorates. The stats say it all: the likelihood of a minimum wage inspection by HMRC for an average employer is once every 500 years. The Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, our foremost agency tasked with tackling precisely the kinds of conditions reported in Leicester, has just over 100 staff to cover the entire labour market of England and Wales. Labour inspectors weren’t even named as “essential workers” on government lists when the pandemic took hold. They’re treated as the poor relation of policing, and yet without them to hold the line, labour abuses escalate into full-blown modern slavery. For government to point the finger at these frontline services for the situation in Leicester is, at best, ignorance of the facts, and, at worst, offensive to these underfunded agencies.Finally, the most effective defenders of workplace rights are workers themselves. We’ve become inured to the decline of unions, and yet Covid-19 demonstrates their importance: without them ensuring that health and safety rules – like social distancing and PPE – are observed, this job is left to business. Brands do have the power to ensure unionisation in their supply chains, just like they have the power to impose such low prices for orders that necessitate poverty wages, but they don’t use it. Boohoo was outed during a 2019 parliamentary inquiry for refusing “even the most basic level of engagement” with the union Usdaw, and for being generally hostile to workers organising for their rights. If the government really wants to avoid more lockdowns and more exploitation, it should mandate unionisation in high-risk sectors.Properly funded labour inspection, ensuring reporting abuse is safe for migrant workers, and strong unionisation are the foundations of a decent and healthy labour market. Without them in place, we’ll continue to have the kind of appalling situation exposed in Leicester. The health of our workplaces and communities requires us not to be distracted by red herring explanations but to keep calling for a post-Covid-19 future that puts these foundations firmly in place at last.• Emily Kenway is senior adviser at Focus on Labour Exploitation and author of The Truth about Modern Slavery, published in January 2021"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03fd9f4d55e1f368fcc6bcde47d5ba4c6e2d84e1/0_149_4000_2402/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=64bda6a3f258e7126738b4964e7a6f3f","title":"huge atlas statue to guard sicilys temple of zeus once more","story":"Sculpture – 8m high and around 2,500 years old – will sit outside magnificent example of Ancient Greek architectureA colossal statue of Atlas, buried for centuries among ancient ruins, will soon take its rightful place among the ancient Greek temples of Agrigento on Sicily.The city’s archaeological park announced that the artwork, one of the most celebrated sculptures on the island, will be raised upright in front of the Temple of Zeus.In Greek mythology, Atlas was a Titan or god who was forced to bear the sky on his shoulders after being defeated by Zeus, one of the next generation of gods called Olympians.The statue, eight metres high and built in the 5th century BC, was one of nearly 40 that adorned the ancient building, considered the largest Doric temple ever built, even if it was never completed and now lies in ruins.Archaeologists and architects will soon start work to raise the statue in Sicily’s Valley of the Temples on the occasion of the founding of the ancient city of Akragas (now Agrigento) 2,600 years ago.It was one of the leading population centres in the region during the golden age of Ancient Greece and holds seven well-preserved Greek temples. Built on a high ridge over a  of 100 years, they remain among the most magnificent examples of Greek architecture. In the 5th century, over 100,000 people lived there and, according to the philosopher Empedocles, they would “party as if they’ll die tomorrow, and build as if they’ll live forever”.The city was destroyed in 406 BC by the Carthaginians, and its prosperity did not return until the rise of Timoleon in the late third century BC. During the Punic wars, the Carthaginians defended the settlement against the Romans, who seized control of the city in 210 BC.\u2028During the Roman era, the city – renamed Agrigentum (subsequently known as Girgenti) – underwent a period of monumental urban redevelopment with new public buildings, including at least two temples.Over the centuries, brickwork from the old monuments of the ancient city was taken for use in the construction of the buildings around Girgenti and the ancient harbour of Porto Empedocle.\u2028Historians also maintained that the Temple of Zeus was never finished because it was still lacking a roof when Akragas was conquered by the Carthaginians.\u2028\u2028Outside the temple, huge statues of Atlas were frozen in the act of supporting the temple.\u2028“The idea is to reposition one of these Atlases in front of the temple,” says Sciarratta, “so that it may serve as a  of the structure dedicated to the father of the gods.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1238723c84967cb47c80691998b028c523ef2622/0_338_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c83f9954a923813c4891669a7f0eb068","title":"what tattoo are you planning on getting post lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from people who are looking at getting a new tattoo and the reasons behind itWith tattoo parlours in England able to reopen from 13 July we would like to know what tattoos people will be getting post-lockdown.What design are you getting and why?

Muaddi often wears trainers in the daytime – “classic Nike, or Yeezy, probably with an elegant pant” – but “a sneaker isn’t a dancing shoe, to me. I never, ever wear flats at night. Heels have a kind of magic, like a superwoman suit.”Every pair in Muaddi’s first Fenty shoe drop has a formidable 10cm heel, but she insists they are comfortable enough for the dancefloor, thanks to the signature flared heel shape. When Muaddi launched her label she reimagined the stiletto heel shape, which “didn’t feel modern enough. I looked at flared heels, but they looked too chunky, too vintage – so I combined the two.”The result – an asymmetric hourglass, like a champagne flute with a Toblerone-chunk of pyramid at the base – spreads the pressure of the heel over a wide surface area, making the shoes more comfortable and grass- and grating-proof. For her first Fenty shoes, Muaddi has streamlined her eponymous heel into a flared cylinder silhouette – kind of a long, hand-rolled cigarette, if you like. Every style is Rihanna-approved: rope straps to fasten up the calf, squared-off toes, backless mules.“Everything that you think Rihanna would be – when you meet her, she’s that,” says Weaver. “Everything that she puts out in her public persona is right there. She’s kind and she’s funny. She’s demanding, but also very generous. With last year’s launch of the Fenty Maison, Rihanna became the first black woman to lead a fashion brand for LVMH, the world’s largest luxury conglomerate. Bernard Arnault of LVMH pledged “a talented and multicultural team supported by the group resources” to the new brand.“From the moment I learned about the partnership with LVMH, I was thinking about the history that RiRi is making,” says Weaver. “This is a cultural shift in terms of representation at the highest level, in our industry. This goes way past fashion.”The global scale of the Black Lives Matter movement since the death of George Floyd has intensified what was already “a constant conversation” in the most erse luxury house in Paris. “Rihanna uses her power to show the possibilities for black people and to nourish those opportunities for me and for other people. This is so huge, that you kind of have to start in your own back yard. Start with what mentorship and leadership that you can provide. Showing the path to change is, and will continue to be, part of our work. It could be partnering with historically black colleges, or developing links between business and minority youth.”“Look, I’ve been talking about ersity from when I was able to talk, because that’s me – I am erse”, says Muaddi. “Brown people like me have always known how important ersity is. Maybe for white people it didn’t cross their minds until it hit them in the face, I don’t know.“But I’m not trying to lead, I’m just trying to do the right thing in my business, and that means having ersity in my team and in my campaigns. I am happy that the world is waking up and if what I do sets an example that’s great, but this is not about looking good on social media.”Amina’s lockdown companion, French bulldog Alfie, is snoring in the background during our Zoom conversation. “This has been one of the most challenging times of my life,” she says, “but also a time that has brought growth.”Even before the pandemic brought the fashion cycle to a standstill, Muaddi was pushing back against the speed of the trend cycle, presenting just two collections each year. “Everything was moving too fast. It’s not fair on the consumer if a luxury product is quickly out of date. Now we’ve had a pause and a reset, and fashion is starting up again almost from zero. That’s kind of scary. But it’s also an opportunity to do things differently.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d81574b61844790a12d2b2eadee52c3e72df6c6d/16_423_3228_1935/master/3228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1776154b696c4c230f69a9477605b315","title":"kelly preston a life in pictures","story":"Kelly Preston, whose long acting career included hits such as Twins, Jerry Maguire and What a Girl Wants, has died, her husband, John Travolta, said.

Email feast@theI love Thai and Vietnamese curries, but is it  worth making the curry paste from scratch? And what’s the secret to a great one? Adam, London SE10When faced with a cooking conundrum, I often ask: “What would Nigel Slater do?” In this instance, he mixes his own green curry paste: “I like the vibrancy that comes from the freshly-blitzed lemongrass, ginger, garlic and coriander leaves,” to which he then adds shrimp paste, fish sauce and a pinch of sugar. For red curry paste, Slater turns to shop-bought, finding them hotter and the sourness “more pronounced” than his homemade efforts.The beauty of making your own, however, says Thuy Diem Pham, chefowner of The Little Viet Kitchen in London, is that you can tailor it to your own taste. “I’m from the south of Vietnam, and every household has their own recipe, using ingredients their family likes. If you buy it, you can’t do that.” For hers, she crushes lemongrass, galangal, red shallots, fresh ginger, chillies, shrimp paste, dried turmeric, coriander seeds and cumin, it keeps for four weeks in an airtight jar in the fridge.A granite pestle and mortar will make all the difference to the texture. As chef Sebby Holmes, author of new book Thai in 7, puts it: “A proper Thai curry is made with brute force.” Diem Pham agrees: “Don’t change tradition unnecessarily – you’ll see the colour and flavours alter as you crush more chillies and shallots.” Using a food processor isn’t the end of the world, though, she says – just don’t tell her mum.Chillies are always the starting point, and the type of chilli depends on what you’re making: dried, long red ones for red-curry paste, fresh green bird’s eye chillies for green. Dried chillies, Holmes explains, should be soaked, then charred in a wok to “take the edge off”, before removing the seeds. He then adds one ingredient at a time: “Get the chillies to a paste, scoop out, and go through your hardy ingredients – galangal, lemongrass, krachai (wild ginger) – before adding fresh chilli, coriander root and, finally, the spices (cumin, coriander seeds, white peppercorns).” The key, he says, is to pound, pound, pound: “You want to keep going until you think it’s done, and then go some more.”When it comes to cooking, Diem Pham scoops out two tablespoons of paste and adds coconut cream, followed by vegetables, tofu or chicken. For Holmes, it’s a tale of two halves: “Prepare your meat so it’s delicious on its own, then make the curry as good as you can, and stick them together at the end.” Cook it for too long, though, and the freshness from the paste will be lost.If ingredients are hard to come by, chef Natalie Tangsakul, whose debut venture Talad is a tribute to her northern Thai upbringing, suggests buying a ready-made hung lay curry paste. “It uses spices that are easy to find – cardamom, coriander seeds, peppercorns, cumin.” She adds smoked, dried chillies to taste, then uses it to marinate chicken thighs (or chickpeas, if you’re veggie) overnight alongside garlic and ginger, before frying with tamarind paste, palm sugar and tamari.For Holmes, leftover red curry paste should be seasoned with palm sugar and fish sauce, then rubbed into scored sea bass or bream. After resting for a few hours, deep-fry the fish whole in a wok filled with 180C-degree rapeseed oil for five to six minutes, until crisp, then serve in the middle of the table with salad and rice, “hacking at the fish with your fingers or, these days, a fork and mask”.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

The 33-year-old has joined the Scottish champions as the part-time team prepare to play the German champions Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals on 21 August in San Sebastián.Van Wyk represented Fortuna Hjørring most recently but her contract with the Danish club was terminated in January after injury problems. The defender has also played for, among others, Houston Dash in the NWSL and the club she founded in South Africa, JVW FC.Uefa changed the rules this month to allow for up to six new players to be registered for the final seven games of the tournament, which has led to a flurry of signings from the eight teams left in the competition.“I am extremely excited to start this new chapter in my football career with a football club that is known to be the best team in the Scottish top league,” said Van Wyk. “I look forward to playing in the Women’s Champions League, win titles and most importantly continue to learn as much as I can about the insights of the game and hopefully add value to the squad with the experience I carry.”Glasgow City have received financial backing from the fund manager and philanthropist James Anderson to enable the club to compete in the mini-tournament to conclude the 2019-20 Champions League. A benefactor of Hearts Football Club, Anderson has also given £250,000 to help the women’s game through the pandemic and £3m to the men’s Scottish Premier League.The Glasgow City co-founder and club manager, Laura Montgomery, said: “If we are talking about players who are known across the world, Janine is in that category. Her record is incredible on and off the pitch in what she has done for girls’ and women’s sport in her own country as well as in her promotion of equality.“Her jersey is on display at the Fifa Museum next to the other top female players in the world, this is the calibre of player and inidual that she is. At Glasgow City, we are all about championing women and girls and Janine very much fits into that mould.

I gather one or two sites are reporting that I have been sacked. Well I guess I have … from one job, but I’ve done nothing wrong.“I’m the same person I’ve always been. Like me or hate you’re entitled to do either. Like everyone else in football I’m a matter of opinion, I totally get that. I totally respect ITV’s right to change their opinion of me.“But, let me make it quite clear – I have not stepped down, I have been moved aside. I’m just going to miss the England games so much, even more than I’ll miss the Champions League games and that is all.”ITV announced on Tuesday morning that Tyldesley would no longer be the main voice of their football coverage from the start of next season.Joining ITV from the BBC in 1996, Tyldesley became their top commentator after the 1998 World Cup. He covered every international tournament since and noted that he had been due to commentate on the European Championship final last weekend, until it was postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.The voice behind any number of great international moments, Tyldesley was also synonymous with the Champions League. Thanks to ITV’s long-standing relationship with the competition he provided the words to go with Liverpool’s miracle in Istanbul, Didier Drogba’s header for Chelsea against Bayern Munich and, most famously, “that night in Barcelona” when Manchester United won the Champions League to complete the treble in 1999.The Sky Sports presenter Jeff Stelling tweeted: “Clive does more prep and stats than me – and his are useful! Baffling as you are as good as ever! Oh I forgot Clive you are 65. Ageism alive and well in UK broadcasting.”Niall Sloane, the director of ITV Sport, meanwhile, paid brief tribute to Tyldesley in a statement: “On behalf of ITV Sport, I would like to thank Clive for his superb work leading our commentary on some of the biggest occasions in world football throughout his outstanding career with us.“We are very glad he will continue with us and look forward to working with him on many more occasions in the future.”Matterface, 42, is already a regular commentator for ITV and will take over from Tyledesley in time for England’s proposed autumn internationals. He will not be obliged to give up his role at TalkSport, where he is also chief commentator.The BBC’s Gary Lineker paid tribute to Tyldesley on Twitter, saying: “One of the very best commentators our game has had. Seriously tough act to follow. Good luck, Clive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a66af09cd95c10776477e1abea9e4f2505229954/233_521_3020_1812/master/3020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc521281eb782526dded3b8579bede33","title":"west bromwich albion v fulham championship live","story":"Where do we stand in the Championship?

Using Google tools helped Little Box of Books become a bestsellerLynsey Pollard picks up her phone from the kitchen table and pans the camera around to reveal dozens of boxes stacked through the living room behind her. “There’s another bookcase full downstairs and some in the hallway,” she says. “You should have seen it two months ago you could barely move. We even had to store them under the bed.”It’s been a hectic three months for the director of Little Box of Books, a subscription service for children’s books she runs with her partner Neil Langston from their London flat. In mid-March, just before the coronavirus lockdown, they took the risk of ordering a three-month supply of books instead of the normal one-month’s supply.“We had no idea how business would go, how our suppliers would manage or if they’d even exist afterwards,” Pollard says. “We wondered what would happen if one of us got sick. Neil also runs an IT consultancy and we’ve got an 18-month-old and a six-year-old to look after. For a two-person business, it was quite intimidating.”Pollard credits Google tools for the surge. “Google My Business has helped us to help our customers,” she explains. “We could let them know we were still open for business and fully stocked up. It is amazing to have a versatile and visible storefront apart from the website that drives traffic to our products, helping people to find us and trust us.”For Pollard and Langston, who founded the company in 2018 with the aim of bringing greater ersity to kids’ bookshelves at home and in school, this enhanced ability to create awareness of their product and capitalise on it is central to not just their business, but to their mission.Pollard, who previously worked in charity communications, had the idea during a period as a single mum to her eldest son. “I just didn’t see our family in any of the stories I was reading to him.” Now, each month, after scouring scores of publishing lists, she sends customers hand-wrapped books and other learning resources that include characters with different racial backgrounds, disabilities, step-parents, single parents, two mums, two dads and anything else that more accurately reflects the society we live in.Pollard and Langston hadn’t even finished testing their website, but she soon found herself on Sky News discussing the study and her new business. To make the most of the media exposure at the time, Pollard started using Google ads so her website would appear when people searched for more erse books. “It helped bring us our first customers who weren’t friends or family,” says Pollard. “That was such a great feeling, to know that people wanted to buy our product.”“We thought books and learning resources that would transport them outside of their family bubble during this time could be important,” says Pollard. “So we created ads to reference that, and help more people to find us.”Pollard says Google tools have enabled their business to reach an entirely new audience in recent months. “They have brought hundreds of people to us who may not have realised that most children’s books don’t accurately reflect the world we live in today. I love that it’s why we set up the company. I’ll continue to update my Google My Business as another place where people can find our business.”There’s a social element to all that Pollard and Langston do. For every box purchased, they send one to London-based child literacy charity Doorstep Library. And since March, each new order has received a stamped envelope addressed to a care home resident, so children can write letters or draw pictures for older people who are isolated.When we speak, anti-racism protests have spread from the US to the UK, further highlighting the need for greater ersity on children’s bookshelves. Pollard is already noticing the impact on her business. “People want to do better for their kids. Sometimes they just need a little help. We’d love it if all children could see themselves in stories. Then instead of talking about ‘erse books’, we could just talk about ‘books’.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4f7acfc3194f00ecda4700c0b498dc5be501c9d/0_422_4670_2804/master/4670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f0bbc502908ba6419b9ac4192ef6240","title":"england and scotland retailers share your thoughts on mandatory masks","story":"We’d like to hear from retailers on the announcement that wearing face masks will be mandatory in shops in England from 24 JulyAfter mixed messages last week regarding the UK government’s stance on face masks, prime minister Boris Johnson is today set to announce the mandatory wearing of masks in shops in England.The policy, which will be implemented on 24 July, will be enforced by police with fines of up to £100 for non-compliance, but shop workers will be expected to “encourage” people to wear masks.We’d like to hear from retailers about how they feel about the policy of mandatory masks in shops.

I failed to notice that I had inadvertently added four additional packs to my order. So I ended up ordering 40 pairs of briefs at a cost of £193.I tried to cancel the order immediately, but was told to send it away at the door. Unfortunately, I’d broken my ankle so couldn’t get to the door quickly enough. I made an abortive attempt to return the 40 pairs in their entirety, but misunderstood the returns procedure, so the briefs boomeranged back. I’m hoping to return the excess packs when Next reopens but I might just wrap up a pair as a tree present to myself every Xmas for next four years. Tim ClarkThey apologised for the mix-up. Apparently it is a cycling mask for cold weather. We got a refund but she ended up keeping it. Nicholas OettleI love fashion and absolutely hate shopping online. I’ve been buying more fashion magazines than usual to replace browsing in shops, but I cannot bring myself to buy clothes without seeing them and trying them on in real life. But I thought I couldn’t go wrong with some lovely earrings I saw in Grazia – very cool looking amber resin hoops – so I put aside my online shopping fears and ordered them.When they arrived they were at least twice as big as I had imagined. They knock against my jumper if I wear a polo neck, they weigh a ton and hurt when I put my headphones on over them. Both my daughters think they look great so I kept them. Everyone says you can just send it back, but that feels like a personal failure of judgement and taste. Katy LimmerI bought some kitchen cloths from Amazon for £6.99. When the parcel arrived, it was a small box and I thought “that’s a bit big for cloths”. I opened it up to find a kids toy – a talking dinosaur called Torr. It did not clean surfaces at all. I found a gift message in the box too. I think it was meant to go to a little boy for his birthday.

Unfortunately for me “should have gone to Specsavers” applied I meant to order a number of inidual bags, but bought a 16kg bag by mistake.At first I offered it for free to people on the local Facebook group formed to help during the crisis, but got no takers.

Caroline Swan, EdinburghThe water where I live is extremely hard, making my skin and hair feel horrible. Water softeners are quite pricey, so I thought this hard water shower kit could be the answer. When I opened it I realised it was cheap, very plasticky. The hard water filter was heavy and the shower head dropped off the cradle because it couldn’t take the weight. This stretched the hose, which showed the plastic tubing through the centre, which then started to leak. The shower head also had a stream of water drips coming off it. I bought 60 loo rolls on Groupon for £20 including postage. I had not envisaged the reality of 60 loo rolls and was very surprised by the huge bag that arrived on my doorstep. I gave lots of them away and made fun of myself on Facebook. I have previous for this sort of thing, having once ordered a 3kg whole salmon thinking it was three pounds. I had to cook it in the dishwasher. Sue NicholsonI bought a “camping table” from Blacks to prepare and cook meals on, but I neglected to check the dimensions. It doesn’t even reach my knees. The price – just £8 – should have been a clue. I ended up keeping it. My kids will get some use out of it.

Now, employees across the world long for chats by the coffee machine and the whirr of printersDahlia Francis is sitting on a small couch at the foot of her bed, in her shared flat, on a housing estate in south London. She wears her new uniform of pyjama bottoms and a Zoom-ready plain T-shirt. Her room used to be a living room. Now the only communal space is the kitchen, where Francis’s three flatmates occupy a small dining table. They, like almost half of Britain’s workforce, are also working from home.Francis, who is 29, is a credit controller for a charity in central London. She commuted there, by bus and tube, for a little more than a year. There were baking competitions and quizzes and a kitchenette, where gossip and tea flowed freely. Now the kettle is silent and the cubicles are empty. They are likely to remain so for the rest of the year.For the first few weeks after her office closed in late March, Francis was too busy to consider her new circumstances. Then they hit her – and got her down. Days spent in her bedroom hunched over a laptop, centimetres from where she slept, blurred into endless weeks. She has become lonely.Francis has worked for a tool hire firm and a betting chain, as well as for charities. The offices she remembers have taken on a different shape in her mind. “I used to think of a desk as like a kind of prison cell, where I was chained for eight hours a day,” she tells me over the phone. “It was always like serving time. But, at this point, my desk would be my saviour.”Lockdown has not so much redrawn the workplace of millions as it has chewed it up like a broken printer. Working from home, a mode traditionally viewed with suspicion by bosses and with envy by commuting bureausceptics, has become the norm for those whose livings are tied to computer screens.As weeks become months and offices remain closed, many are predicting their permanent decline. Buildings that for decades have defined urban geography, diurnal rhythms and the meaning of work may never hum in the same way to the sounds of keyboards and fluorescent lighting.“I’ve spoken to about eight startups that have already got rid of their office,” says Matt Bradburn, the co-founder of London-based People Collective, which advises companies on human resources. “And we’re talking companies of 50 to 100 people.” Elsewhere, firms including Twitter and Facebook have said they will allow employees to work from home for ever.When Bradburn polled his network of more than 5,000 HR bosses, he asked for the biggest reasons their teams had shared for wanting to go back to the office. Seventy per cent cited social and mental health issues, including feelings of loneliness. “I think young people in particular really need that connection,” Bradburn says.The assumption has been that remote workers slack without direct supervision. But do they? In 2010, a Chinese travel agency with 16,000 employees came to Bloom in search of evidence. Ctrip, which assumed workers would prefer being at home, was spending big money on offices in Shanghai. It wanted to know what remote work might do for the bottom line. “Their proposition was that they’d save on rent, but lose on productivity,” Bloom says.Bloom devised a trial – the first of its kind – involving 250 members of a Ctrip call centre. Half of the group were selected at random to work from home for nine months. The other half would continue to work in the office and the productivity of both teams would be measured.But the experiment also measured happiness. When Ctrip polled staff, half of the home-based group wanted to go back to the office. “Loneliness was the single biggest reason,” Bloom says. Plus, they were not in lockdown conditions: only people with a spare room took part none had children at home or flatmates and they still worked one day a week in the office.Bloom is now constantly fielding calls from anxious executives. “They have said productivity has been great and they’re thinking of abandoning the office,” he says. “I’m counselling that it’s shortsighted and high-risk.” Bloom had always been supportive of remote working, if not full-time, even after the Ctrip experiment. “Now I feel like I’ve gone from being an evangelist for working from home to an evangelist for the office,” he says.Erin Mackenzie, 23, knows what it can be like to work remotely full-time without the stresses of lockdown. Last summer, she got a junior marketing job with an online education company based in the Middle East. Mackenzie, who lives in a small house in a small town 50 miles north of New York City, thought working from home would be great.After four months of long days alone at the tiny desk in her bedroom, Mackenzie had a panic attack. She had lost weight and become depressed. “At first, I thought it was because the job was demanding, but I realised it was more the isolation and not being able to interact with people,” she says. “I hadn’t realised I’d relied on that so heavily for my mental health.”Mackenzie also felt suffocated by the digital monitoring, which was already becoming standard in big firms. Hers was relatively light. An agenda app would track tasks and alert faceless bosses when they were done. Response times to chats were noted. “It definitely added to me feeling like I didn’t have set hours and the anxiety of it all,” she says.If offices were to evolve to extract as much as possible from human resources, there are concerns that firms would use technology to tighten the screws further in our homes. Interest in the software offered by Teramind, a Florida-based employee monitoring and analytics firm with more than 2,000 clients, has tripled in lockdown. When downloaded to employees’ computers, Teramind’s “agent” can measure time spent on different windows. It can play back or live-stream a view of an employee’s screen and record his or her every keystroke. It can also raise a flag if certain predetermined words are typed.Will Gosling, who leads Deloitte’s consulting on “human capital” in the UK, says: “We’re at the beginning of a very big ethical debate about this. We were already seeing businesses wanting to get more data on employees and the pandemic has brought it into sharp focus … but they need to support and build health and wellbeing.”Trade unions worry that working from home will challenge privacy and rights, making it harder for employees to organise or be aware of how colleagues are being treated, particularly in the most onerous fields of white-collar work. There are questions about liability. Mental health is part of the picture. “Employers have a responsibility to ensure worker wellbeing and that doesn’t end just because people are not in the office,” says Tim Sharp, the senior policy officer for employment rights at the Trades Union Congress.Mackenzie quit after the panic attack and got a job with an insurer. She immediately felt better, even while enduring a two-hour commute to Manhattan for her training. She now works in a smaller office a short drive from home – or, rather, she did until the pandemic. It helps that she now works for a better, kinder company. Her fiance is working at home, too. “Without him here, I probably would have crumbled,” she says.At their best, offices are crucibles for ideas and lifelong friendships, particularly among younger workers with small homes but big social circles. The Office was not just a comic study of business park malaise – it was a love story. Working from home may boost productivity for a while, “but it’s so costly in terms of creativity and inspiration”, Bloom says. “We’re all suffering from Zoom overload and feeling worn down.”Flick Adkins, who is 28, counts some of her colleagues as her best friends. For three months, she has been cut off from them while working from the flat she shares with five other people in north London. She works for LRWTonic, a market research company, and takes a lot of private calls. She has to sit cross-legged on her bed, stacking her laptop on part of her vinyl collection. She has settled on 20 records as the optimal height.Adkins’s now empty office has a ping pong table and a coffee machine, where she would chat with friends before starting her day. On Fridays, she and her 20 mostly young colleagues would go out for lunch and have drinks after work.Like Francis, Adkins feels lonely, down and unmotivated. “Having an office was symbolic of normality,” she says. “I loved just being at my desk and hearing the buzz and all the conversations … I can count on two hands the number of times I’ve said: ‘I don’t know much longer I can do this.’”Last month, Adkins’s boss, Anna Dunn, floated with her team the idea of ditching the office for good and saving £200,000 a year in rent. “I said that the money would be distributed to them in a bonus, to some degree,” Dunn, 40, says from her kitchen. She, too, misses the office. “I thought there might be this desire to stay remote, but not one person does. They all want to go back.”The sounds of the office have a new resonance. More than half a million people have tuned into The Sound of Colleagues, a web page and Spotify playlist of workplace sounds, including keyboards, printers, chatter and coffee machines. Red Pipe, a Swedish music and sound studio, created it in April as a joke, but its data suggests that people keep it on in the background.If reports of the death of the office have been exaggerated, everyone agrees it won’t look the same. Bloom envisages a new landscape of smaller offices, with employees alternately working at home for half the week to bring down costs and make physical distancing more viable. Budgets for nice interiors will fall. “I think the office will be more suburban, more spacious and nastier-looking,” he says.Francis would not care. When I speak to her, she has taken a week of holiday. She had anxiety before the pandemic, which partly expressed itself in a need to be busy all the time. But, after three months of sometimes 12-hour days and a deepening sense of unease, burnout has become a worrying prospect. Not that she can really escape her place of work. “I’m just sort of winging it this week and not planning too much,” she says from her bedroom couch. “I just need a bit of time to gather myself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dcb50ae7170f2121a4b5bf8fec36cca5b5fde6d/0_283_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2f3701aeb03650e3280d30e5a20428f","title":"insurance company claimed our letter was lost in the post","story":"Because of suspected coronavirus, we needed a refund for our cancelled party We took out insurance on 24 February 2020 to cover us if we had to cancel my daughter’s bat mitzvah party, planned for 29 March. The policy was underwritten by UK General but administered by the Davies Group. We had to cancel the party not because the venue had cancelled, but because on 15 March I fell ill with suspected Covid-19 and had a high fever and dry cough. My GP recommended my children and I continued self-isolation.I cancelled on 18 March, at a cost of £3,612, and on 26 March made an “illness” claim rather than a “venue cancellation” claim.But, at the moment, it appears as if the claim has not even been sent to UK General for processing, despite my being advised twice over the phone that it was valid, and even straightforward. When you made your claim, you sent a bundle of documents to Davies Group for processing, wisely using recorded delivery. After not hearing anything for nearly a month, you called in late April, only to be told it had not received your claim and knew nothing about it. Fortunately, you had a copy of the receipt confirming that the company had taken delivery in March.

Fortunately, UK General got back swiftly, and said that after a review it had agreed to pay.

Now she is back with a self-released album, and going her own wayWhen Brandy Norwood was 14 she went to see her idol Whitney Houston in concert. Stuck in the nosebleed seats, she decided to blag her way backstage at the end of the show. “I was just telling security: ‘I’m going to be a star someday, I’m going to pay all your bills if you just let me back,’” she says via Zoom, her trademark husky voice frayed slightly by final sessions for her new album, B7. Amazingly, the charm offensive worked, but Houston had already gone. “I was crushed,” she sighs. “My mom was like: ‘You’ll meet her when you put music out.’”That same year, 1993, Brandy signed to Atlantic Records. A year later, she released her Grammy-nominated, self-titled debut. By 1996, she was the star of the teen sitcom Moesha, and, in 1997, she was hand-picked by Houston to play the title role in a TV remake of Cinderella. “So I’m working with her side by side,” she says, eyes wide. “It’s just something that’s still surreal to this day.”For a period in the late 90s and early 00s it felt as if Brandy, AKA the fan-ordained “vocal Bible”, was being fast-tracked for Houston-level success. Her second album, 1998’s Never Say Never, sold 16m copies worldwide, thanks in part to its lead single The Boy Is Mine. A playfully confrontational duet with fellow R\u0026ampB upstart Monica, it spent 13 weeks at No 1 in the US, finishing as the year’s best-selling single. Its opulent sound – fluttering harps, cascading backing vocals, elasticated bass – rewired the genre, with its then-unknown co-producer Rodney “Darkchild” Jerkins and co-writer LaShawn Daniels going on to craft era-defining hits for the likes of Destiny’s Child, Jennifer Lopez and Houston herself. A year later, now one of the biggest pop stars in the world, Brandy was given her own line of Barbie dolls. “A black Barbie with braids and little baby hairs coming out,” she smiles. “Truly unbelievable.”While there were other hits – Have You Ever, What About Us?, Talk About Our Love – by 2005 Brandy’s commercial appeal had stalled. In 2006, she was involved in a fatal road accident (a topic very much off the table during our interview) that forced her to quit as a judge on America’s Got Talent. While subsequent albums showed flashes of brilliance, they were often undermined by her rocky relationship with music itself. “Sometimes you get caught up in being popular and relevant, and that makes you lose the reason why you’re connected to music,” she says. “I’m scared of that. I don’t ever want to get to a point where I’m doing music for the wrong reasons.”The good news is that the soulful B7 – her first album in eight years – sounds like the work of an artist re-energised, with those trademark vocal flexes cocooned in outre production and playful throwback moments such as lead single Baby Mama’s celebration of her 18-year-old daughter, Sy’rai. It also arrives at the perfect time: the 41-year-old is now feted as a massive influence on modern R\u0026ampB, with 2002’s glitchy, UK garage-influenced Full Moon and 2004’s sumptuous Afrodisiac – lauded by everyone from Rihanna to Red Hot Chili Peppers’s John Frusciante – both hailed as canon.It is not just turn-of-the-millennium nostalgia. In 2013, shortly after the release of Brandy’s sixth album Two Eleven, which featured input from self-confessed stan Frank Ocean, Solange tweeted at white music critics: “Like you really should know about deep Brandy album cuts before you are giving a ‘grade’ or a ‘score’ to any R\u0026ampB artist.” It’s those deep cuts that keep drawing other modern R\u0026ampB practitioners to her back catalogue, from Kehlani to Beyoncé proteges Chloe x Halle. Can she hear her influence in R\u0026ampB now? “Yes … ” she says coyly. “A lot. And it’s so flattering.”Brandy Norwood was always destined to be a singer. As a young child she would accompany her dad, a gospel vocalist and choir director, to their local church in Mississippi. “Watching what people’s voices did to audiences, I wanted to see if my voice could do a little of that,” she recalls. When she was four, her family moved to LA. A talent show regular, her demo CD eventually found its way to Atlantic when the label signed her, Brandy’s mum became her manager.A year after her debut album made her a teen star, she landed the title role in Moesha, a sitcom based around the upper-middle class Mitchell family. Brandy, playing a headstrong character on TV each week, was quickly defined as the ultimate good girl next door, a perception that meant she had to hide a relationship with the Boyz II Men singer Wanya Morris, five years her senior. She says that following “this perfection map” meant people were constantly waiting for her to slip up, a fear that raised its head again in 2004 when Sy’rai’s father, the producer Robert Smith, revealed the pair faked their 2001 marriage to preserve the singer’s reputation. “When I started to make mistakes I was judged harshly at times,” she says. “That got very difficult for me.”When The Boy Is Mine came out, Brandy’s leap from teen star to adult artist was cemented. The song, inspired by the domestic arguments on Jerry Springer, came with its own in-built tabloid narrative of warring women. Fiction was assumed to be fact as stories swirled about altercations between Brandy and Monica. She laments that the gossip around their friendship meant they only performed the song together once, at the 1998 VMA awards. “For us to be put against each other like that, I didn’t think that was funny at all,” she says. “We didn’t really get a chance to experience what we could have with The Boy Is Mine. The fanbases and the media really threw a wrench in that experience.”Outside interference has dampened other career peaks, too. Having crafted Afrodisiac alongside producer Timbaland, her label lined up newcomer Kanye West for extra sessions, eventually insisting, much to Brandy’s protestations, that the lead single be their collaboration, Talk About Our Love. “I like that song now,” she insists, “but back then I was like ‘nope’.” It was such a last-minute decision that Brandy had already started rehearsing for the video shoot for the Timbaland-produced Black Pepper, a song that didn’t make the final tracklisting and has since taken up mythic status. “It definitely exists,” she confirms. “I just, erm, don’t know where it is.”Two songs that did make it on to Afrodisiac sample her favourite band Coldplay, while Full Moon’s layered vocals were heavily influenced by castle-dwelling, ethereal Irish warbler Enya. When I playfully question her taste she suddenly grows animated. “Enya’s a joke to you?” she says, both eyebrows arched. “Coldplay? A joke? That’s not even possible. I’m a little bit offended.” She changes tack when she realises I’m geographically closer to Enya, her dream collaborator. “Actually, can you make Brandy and Enya happen? Don’t just laugh. If you have connects to the castle let me know.”For now, Enya can wait. While in many ways B7, released via her own label, is classic Brandy, off-kilter production anchored by a voice still deep enough to swim in, it also feels like a fresh start. No more placating egos, no more chasing commercial expectations. Having previously had her experiences distilled into other people’s words, she is now credited as a co-writer on every song, often alongside her early mentor LaShawn Daniels, who helped turn those burning ambitions into reality. Tragically, Daniels died last September during the making of the album.“It’s a little scary because I had to finish it without him,” she says, dabbing away tears. “I just wonder: would he be proud of what I was able to put together?” She takes a breath. “Music is my therapy,” she nods, almost to herself. “I don’t know what my life would be without it.”B7 is out on 31 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0c0789298969fd5d5ec4e53f79bac240b173a2f/0_162_5418_3251/master/5418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f250ec9b7cfdb64e0cfab56e16f1cac","title":"what would annexation of parts of the west bank mean for palestinians podcast","story":"The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has proposed permanently seizing Palestinian territory by annexing swathes of the West Bank - a violation of international law.

But there is an acceptance too in government that even if the ‘golden era’ is over, China remains a vital trade relationship as well as a crucial player in global affairs, not least the battle to reduce carbon emissions.

Now everyone faces a new issue: how to return to some semblance of business normality.“The world of work – particularly how we think about work and how we think about where we work, has fundamentally shifted,” says coach and productivity expert Karen Eyre-White. “A lot of businesses have been in crisis mode. What we’re seeing now is them having to get back to a new normal with strategy, boundaries and structure in place.”Some things haven’t changed. As before, high productivity will be a priority – particularly given the gloomy economic predictions. Achieving it depends on motivation, training and technology, time management and support from others. But how can businesses make sure they have these essentials in place as we move out of lockdown and get back to work?Have clarity of purposeWith so much uncertainty around, business leaders need to reassure staff by projecting confidence and clarity wherever possible. “Try to be certain about as much as you can,” says Eyre-White, whether that involves scheduling regular catch-up meetings, or deciding the office won’t reopen until next year. Managers can boost their own productivity and that of their team by being clear about their priorities for any given day or week, and encouraging others to do the same.Aligning those priorities with the company’s objectives will keep even a remote team moving in the right direction, says Chris Bailey, author of Hyperfocus: How to Work Less to Achieve More. “The greatest challenge that businesses face in normal times is orienting what everybody’s working on toward what the purpose of the business is … and that’s still the case,” he says. “The more intentional we are about how we work and what we work on, the more productive we become.”Where priorities have changed, it’s important to communicate that effectively to staff, says Sarah Manning, senior HR director at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “I can’t imagine many organisations didn’t have to pivot in some way in lockdown. Leaders need to be really clear now about what the expectation of their teams are going to be and put in measures to help people adapt.”Empower staff to find their way of workingProductivity can be difficult to measure, but focusing on the tasks achieved rather than the hours someone is at their desk can boost efficiency. Despite reports that lockdown led to an upsurge in demand for workforce surveillance tools, Eyre-White says that such an approach is unlikely to be effective. “Inidually, everyone needs to do different things in order to be productive,” she adds. “I just do not see how a surveillance system is compatible with that.”Instead, businesses should be encouraging staff to find what works for them – some people might be most productive if they go for a walk in the morning, others might take short breaks after 45 minutes of focused work, while some team members might need to work around a young family at home.Projecting empathy for the circumstances many of us find ourselves in is important, says Manning. Particularly at present. “Life is crazy right now. I think employers need to acknowledge that.”Promote good communicationWhen it comes to managing virtual teams, good communication is key to ensuring staff feel supported and informed. “Once a company has made a decision, communicate it clearly,” says Manning. “You need to be careful not to go out with half a message and cause a whole lot of anxiety for people.”Keeping communication channels open can promote a culture of collaboration.Apps such as Zoom, Slack, other digital tools and internal help desks can help ensure “people still feel engaged, connected and therefore invested”, says Manning. Zendesk, for example, has held remote quizzes, yoga classes and Friday night drinks during lockdown. There are other examples of companies holding digital book clubs, remote murder mystery games, and scavenger hunts.“Anything you can do as a manager to foster meaningful connections between employees will go a long way,” Bailey says.It’s OK to have down timeStaff may be working from home, but it’s important not to encourage an “always on” culture that blurs the boundaries between work life and home life, Eyre-White says. “There’s this idea of e-presenteeism and needing to be seen,” she adds. “Staff can’t be seen in the office so they may feel they need to be replying to their emails or messages instantly. And that’s not how you get productive work done. You need time away from those things. Businesses need to be clear that it’s OK.”One way to set the tone is to offer training to managers to help them adapt to working with, and supporting, remote teams. Simple measures can set an example, such as resisting the temptation to email outside work hours, and blocking out time for breaks on a calendar that the team has access to.No one should feel guilty about taking a break from work, says Bailey. “Focusing on things all day long is one of the worst things we can do because our mind just needs a chance to wander. Mind the guilt that you experience around relaxation and know that it’s a phenomenon most of us experience.”Embrace flexibilityAlongside the difficulties of the past few months, for many firms there have also been opportunities for lasting change.“If going remote didn’t kill a business, companies are going to have to decide their answer when employees ask: ‘Can I work from home?’” Manning says. “There are huge benefits from a cost perspective … and I do think companies can potentially attract more candidates and more ersity.”Staying flexible – and that might mean some staff work remotely in the long term – will help foster an inclusive, productive culture that has broader benefits.“This has definitely opened our eyes up to those different possibilities,” Manning adds. “We are going to have a much more flexible approach to where people can work and how they work.”Things are changing fast.

It was an account of my experiences as a club and elite gymnast, and the experiences I shared were the reason for my retirement in January, not a physical injury as was suggested by some at the time.“My complaint was submitted in accordance with the British Gymnastics complaints policy by a legal team from Irwin Mitchell LLP. After eight months, I’m no closer to having any feedback or outcome.”Tinkler, who moved from her previous base at the South Durham Club in Spennymoor to train in Basildon with Max Whitlock’s coach Scott Hahn in 2017, said that she had spoken out after receiving a lot of support and counselling.“I’m heartbroken by the stories that have been told over the past week. I’m so proud of my fellow gymnasts who have shared their stories, I know how hard it is, and your bravery has been a shining light and inspiration in dark and troubling times for the sport we love.“It took a lot of support and counselling to build up the courage to tell my story. I would like to thank Scott and the team at South Essex Gymnastics Club for everything they did for me, without their help I would never have had the strength to begin this journey. I hope someone now listens to us.”In a statement British Gymnastics confirmed it had received formal notification of a complaint from Tinkler last December. “She provided full details of this complaint to us on 10 March 2020 which then allowed the investigation to proceed,” it added. “It is at an advanced stage and we have kept Amy fully informed and provided her with the appropriate support and we will continue to do so. We can make no further comment at this stage in the process.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/519939d191e1561f715f4ea6190a3cdec2159db5/0_89_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01f40251b5139ef0a6d203f9e7fd6865","title":"henry slade diabetes exeter chiefs england rugby","story":"The England player talks about training through lockdown, Exeter’s title push, playing with diabetes and overcoming OCD“I’m ready to crack on,” Henry Slade says as he looks forward to escaping English rugby’s extended lockdown when the season resumes in mid-August. “I’m pretty fed up with all this corona stuff. We’ve been training in groups of five or 10 but there’s been lots of socially distant running and weights – which is better than nothing. But it’s still pretty crap. If I get started on coronavirus we’ll be talking for ages.”Eight months ago Slade came on in a World Cup final, as England lost against South Africa, and his season since then has been blighted by injury and a global pandemic. His club Exeter Chiefs, however, are five points clear at the top of the Premiership and ready for a serious tilt at the European Champions Cup when rugby restarts behind closed doors.“It’s been very disappointing,” Slade says of the lockdown. “We were really excited about what we could, and still can, achieve this year. When so many competitions were cancelled it seemed pretty ominous. But now I want to get started because we’re in a real good spot domestically and in Europe.”Exeter are at home against Northampton in the European quarter-finals in September but, in less than a month, they resume their Premiership campaign against Leicester. That game will be played at Sandy Park in Exeter but Slade pulls a face at a reminder that Leicester is the only city in England forced back into lockdown. The likelihood is the game will proceed – as long as there is not an outbreak of the virus within the clubs.Slade’s frustration is not expressed lightly. He has overcome diabetes his entire career and so he is acutely aware of health issues. But he shakes his head when asked if his condition has been of concern during the Covid-19 pandemic. “I texted the club doctor as soon as I read that people with diabetes are more at risk. He said: ‘You’re absolutely fine as Type 1 because you’re well controlled and you’re young.’”Slade discovered he had diabetes aged 18 – but he has won 26 caps so far for England as a gifted centre. “My dad helped a lot, because I grew up with him having diabetes. I saw him do everything to control it while playing sport. So that was my automatic response when I got diagnosed just before joining Exeter Chiefs. There was never any thought I wouldn’t keep playing.”Controlling his diabetes has improved as he now wears a device to check his blood sugar levels. “Before this, I was doing the finger-prick test 12 times a day. But this thing I wear now tells me what my blood sugars are every five minutes. I used to finger-prick test my blood five or six times before kick-off. Then a couple of times at half-time and straight after the game. Now it’s updating all the time and tells you which direction your bloods are going. So you can inject accordingly, or have food to keep you in the right spot.”Has he had games when his blood sugar levels have been impacted? “Plenty. I didn’t realise the effects of adrenaline and so after a game I would be feeling awful. So drained and tired, everything hurting. Since changing my monitoring I’ve got way more energy at the end of a game.”At the World Cup in Japan last autumn Slade replaced George Ford, who had often been England’s best player, for the quarter-final against Australia. It was one of many occasions when Eddie Jones surprised everyone, including Slade. “Sometimes in training you can read into the selection a little but I didn’t know and he only announced the team on Thursday. We heard at the same time the media guys released the news. I was happy but everyone bought into the belief we were a squad of 33. Everyone would rather not have played, and won the World Cup, than played every game and lost.”England defeated Australia comprehensively and Slade’s excellence was illustrated when he snaffled the ball on his own 22 and burst into space before, while running hard, using his weaker foot to produce a sublime grubber kick to set up a Jonny May try. Shane Williams, offering analysis on television, said: “That’s absolute genius.”Jones has long admired Slade but that did not prevent him from recalling Ford for the semi-final. “I played well against Australia,” Slade recalls. “I was rusty as it was basically my first game of the season. But at our inidual review Eddie said I did very well and he was very happy. When the team to play New Zealand was announced he explained it was just a change of tactics.”New Zealand are famous for turning on the power and winning games from losing positions but they had no answer against an authoritative England. “You sometimes get feelings in games,” Slade says, “and we just felt we weren’t going to lose. New Zealand had a lot of ball but we have so many players who make dominant tackles. Billy Vunipola, Sam Underhill, Tom Curry, Joe Marler put in massive hits.”For the final Jones opted to keep Ford and Owen Farrell at fly-half and inside centre, with Slade on the bench. I worked with Jones on his autobiography for three years and, while writing the last chapter, we met on the Monday night after England lost the final. Jones told me he had been wrong not to start Slade.“When I think about how well the boys played in the New Zealand game can you imagine the shellacking he would have got if he’d made changes and we still lost? I also put myself in those other boys’ shoes. If I’d got dropped after playing that well in the semi-final I’d have been so pissed off. I had no leg to stand on in terms of wanting to start the final.”Slade, at 27, must be optimistic that England can win the 2023 World Cup – and that he can play a significant role? “You have to think that. But three years is a long way away. I’m just worried about next week’s training and how our first game for Exeter goes against Leicester. You can only control what’s in front of you.”During the lockdown Slade had time to reflect. Did he feel angry that Exeter might have been cheated out of other trophies because of the way Saracens broke salary cap rules? “I’m not going to give you a headline like that,” he says dryly. “I don’t actually know the ins and outs of their situation but we’ve played them in a few finals and it’s pretty frustrating to come out on the wrong side.”It’s understandable that Slade should be reticent because many of his England teammates play for Saracens. “We don’t know what other players are getting paid, so you’ve got to look above that to see where the fault lies.”When looking at administrators who run the game what is Slade’s preference in regard to a global calendar? “I like it how it is. I like a summer break and pre-season being in nice weather. I like the start of the season being good, the middle patch being crap and then coming good toward the end again. A team that has to win in the dry and the wet are the real deal.“Obviously there are international windows, Six Nations and then a summer tour. But I don’t fancy club rugby in the summer. Playing the Premiership final at Twickenham often sees it up to 30 degrees and that’s bloody hot. Imagine playing every game like that? I know it’s probably not going to stay the same, but I like it as it is.”Player welfare, surely, must be considered above all else? “I hope so. To play more games than we do is ridiculous. It would be quite dangerous. I hope that is taken into consideration.”During lockdown there has also been time to consider the troubling backdrop to Swing Low, Sweet Chariot. His England teammate Maro Itoje rightly voiced concern but Slade admits he has limited understanding of the controversy. “I had no idea the song had anything to do with slavery. I thought it was a song to cheer on the boys. I’m sure the vast majority of people singing that song had no idea where it originated from.”England’s players will hopefully educate themselves before the next international. Slade has the intelligence and resolve to do so – as he has shown when overcoming other issues. He suffered badly from OCD but finally broke the pattern.“I used to think I had to do things and, if I didn’t, there would be bad news for myself, friends or family. Injury or illness. I’d got it in my head, since I was a little kid, that if I didn’t turn the light switch off the right way, or didn’t put my left sock on before my right sock, or if I put my glass down wrong, it would have a massive effect on the universe.“I had a few sessions with a psychologist and he spoke plainly. Why would me not putting my glass down mean someone’s going to get ill? Why would me not tying my shoelaces right mean someone’s going to get injured? I stopped doing it. Nothing bad happened at training and that weekend I played well. But the worst was playing Wasps away. I didn’t tie my shoelaces how I normally tie them. I went out and broke my leg. That messed me up for a couple of years. But I’ve got used to it and nothing else bad happened. I just tell myself: ‘Look, that’s ridiculous. You’ve been doing it for 20 years but it has no effect on greater things.”Perspective has also been added by the fact that he and his girlfriend are about to become parents. “Megan’s due around 9 August and she’s doing well. But there’s not a lot of space for the baby to go so we’re looking forward to the birth.”Do they know if they are having a boy or girl? “Not yet. There are not many nice surprises in life these days – so this will be a good one.”Henry Slade uses Dexcom’s G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System to help manage his diabetes. dexcomen-GB"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f80c7cdb6bc94e9e203ecc69d6081d1c89268cc/249_900_2033_1220/master/2033.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d82a65b656ed0a9a9a823adcdbcc66c1","title":"howzat club cricket returns post coronavirus lockdown","story":"After months of waiting amateur players across England were finally able to don the whites this weekend and some of the images were breathtaking "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aacb5e27a2c5cefc848c4683241b162b583f62d/0_31_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41fadab26e0b67a610a1dd2b2b4bce31","title":"chichester festival theatre summer concert","story":"Daniel Evans will perform with Omid Djalili, Gabrielle Brooks and Giles Terera in summer show previewing postponed South PacificChichester Festival theatre cancelled its scheduled summer productions for the first time in its history as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The theatre’s traditional big musical is now rescheduled for 2021 but three of the stars of that South Pacific revival will perform in an outdoor August bank holiday concert also featuring Omid Djalili, Gabrielle Brooks, Giles Terera – who played Aaron Burr in Hamilton – and Chichester’s artistic director himself, Daniel Evans.“Thankfully I’ve got the next six weeks to tune up my vocal cords,” said Evans, who won two Olivier awards for best actor in a musical before running Sheffield Theatres and took over at Chichester, in West Sussex, in 2016. He will be directing South Pacific next year. “Even though we can’t open the Festival theatre’s doors yet, we felt it was really important to offer our audiences something uplifting to look forward to this summer,” he said. “We’re very lucky to have both a glorious park and a big car park on our doorstep – so it was a no-brainer to take advantage of both of them, with the sterling support of Chichester District council, and to work with our local independent cinema, Chichester Cinema at New Park, to put on a drive-in cinema.”A raised stage will be erected next to the Festival theatre in Oaklands Park for the theatre’s Movies and Music Weekend on 28-31 August, with plots marked out for audience groups of up to two people and up to six people. Djalili, who starred as Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof in Chichester, will introduce songs from West Side Story, Wicked and The Sound of Music, as well as a medley from South Pacific performed by Gina Beck, Rob Houchen and Julian Ovenden, “to give audiences a taste of what’s in store for next year”.Next year Evans hopes to reconvene the three of them with as many of the original company as possible for South Pacific, which features some of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s best-known songs ,including Some Enchanted Evening and I’m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair.The drive-in cinema, in Chichester’s Northgate car park, will screen musicals including Singin’ in the Rain, The Greatest Showman and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Other events over the weekend include Hugh Bonneville reading Judith Kerr’s The Tiger Who Came to Tea and Mog the Forgetful Cat, accompanied by a puppetry performance. “We’re Hugh Bonneville’s local theatre so we’re thrilled he’s coming to entertain families by reading Judith Kerr’s immortal books on bank holiday Monday,” said Evans, who suggests that the theatre will be able to stage further productions later in the year.Last Thursday, the government gave permission for outdoor theatre productions to take place with the necessary safety measures in place. A number of concerts featuring stage musical stars performing remotely have been streamed in recent weeks. On Wednesday, Terera will host a free online concert in honour of Harry Gabriel, who will be celebrating his 40th anniversary as the Shaftesbury theatre’s stage doorkeeper this year. Judi Dench, Anthony Hopkins, Amanda Holden and Chita Rivera are set to appear.• The Music and Movies Weekend takes place in various venues, Chichester, 28-31 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ef1017bedaacf933a21f4d2324497bc279c882a/0_249_4670_2802/master/4670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e686eb5802b331cf2bd58503b31d7483","title":"lucian msamati salieri amadeus mozart national theatre at home","story":"The star of the National Theatre’s revival, streaming this month, talks about genius, unlocking characters and how Peter Shaffer’s play became an ‘orgy of artistic love’You played Iago in Othello a year before this production. Was that role – of a man also eaten up by jealousy – preparation for this one?The challenge in all of it is to find the weakest point in any character which, I believe, is how you tap into the humanity of that character without judgment. Tapping into jealousy in itself is very easy. It’s more difficult to tap into love for the victim of that jealousy just as Salieri loves music, Iago loves Othello. I don’t think you can commit yourself to such a dogged path of revenge or retribution unless you feel a great love – from great love comes great hurt and hate. The hate is easier to access than the love and it’s more complicated with Iago.Winsome Pinnock recently suggested that when a black actor is cast in a traditionally “white” part they are cut off from the history of their black body. Do you agree?That’s an interesting idea and I completely see the argument. I, however, would argue that in my creative endeavours and work as an artist the first thing I have connected to is the quality of the work of art. I don’t come into anything unaware of who or what I am and what it represents: my skin-colour and my heritage is mine and I carry it everywhere I go. Whenever someone talks about “colour-blindness” I say “I want you to see my colour.”To go back to the idea of a playground, we, as artists, are players in an imaginative playground and none of us can create unless we have room to breathe and play. Having said that, what we are battling now is the question of what “universal” humanity looks and sounds like. What is problematic with the terminology of blind casting is whether you are saying age, race, gender, is outside the human experience. The singers and orchestra all become part of the performance in Amadeus. How easy was it to navigate around all that movement on stage?It was made easier by the exceptional bunch of players I worked alongside, and both the director, Michael Longhurst, and movement director, Imogen Knight, said that whether we were actors, opera singers or the orchestra, we were all one on stage. It was an orgy of artistic love. To be in a room listening to world-class opera singers and asking them, moist-eyed “How did you do that?” and then to see them moist-eyed as they watched us and being asked the same thing, was to be in a space where we could fully appreciate each other’s artistry, because of the democracy introduced by Michael and Imogen.Salieri speaks of Mozart as an “obscene child” channelling “the voice of God” and the play grapples with the idea that gifted people are not always morally deserving of their gift. What are your reflections on that?I think that that’s the folly of the devout – the great falsehood that “I will get to heaven because I go to church and give alms to the poor and because I’m virtuous.”For me now, I’m a much better actor than I was. I’m older, I’m more evolved and I can now say, empirically, that the roles of Iago and Salieri have come specifically because I’m the best at what I do. The higher I have climbed, the more I have grown into myself as a human being but there are always echoes. Getting Iago – which was the more openly provocative role in terms of tradition – was the moment I wanted to kill the voices that come to me in my 3am chats with myself once and for all. I must also say that part of the space I was granted in terms of playing Iago came from Iqbal Khan. Having a director of colour cannot be underestimated. It meant that the team had my back. I wasn’t the peculiarity in the room."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8d63a37b46d4285869d3fd30c31d8660f078a0e/394_114_2549_1530/master/2549.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3747d3dbd574be4da5232aed3a93f4b","title":"theatres that made us its humbling to be upstaged by a dolphin","story":"Aimee Ffion-Edwards reveals the perils of performing at the Minack and Pooja Ghai celebrates the Jacobean beauty of Sam Wanamaker Playhouse Aimee Ffion-Edwards: The Minack theatre, Porthcurno, is an open air theatre carved out of the Cornish clifftops. The sight of the vast Atlantic ocean as the stage’s backdrop and the steep stone auditorium takes your breath away. Weather-dependent, it can be a brutal place to perform but it can also be the most magical. If you’re lucky – or unlucky! – the audience will catch sight of the local dolphins showing off during a matinee. It’s a humbling experience being upstaged by a dolphin. The Minack hosts all sorts of productions during the summer months. In 2008 I was part of a production of Under Milk Wood, set in a Welsh seaside village over the course of a day. You couldn’t find a more appropriate location (outside of Wales, of course). We were lucky to have clear skies and sun for most of that week. We would open the play with a blue sky, the apt sound of seagulls and crashing waves and close it with a starry night for a back cloth. Singing the Eli Jenkins prayer under a full moon with a brilliant cast is something I will always treasure.Charley Miles: I was 15 when a girl at school told me she was writing a play for a competition she’d been given a leaflet about in drama class. I wasn’t allowed to take GCSE drama – my dad didn’t want to encourage the idea of that career: unlikely, unstable. But the 20 pages I wrote over half term won and I got to sit in the Stephen Joseph theatre, across the moors from where we lived – in Scarborough – and hear my script read by six professional actors. I don’t know whether it’s the seaside air or the brilliantly loud carpet, but the SJT’s total lack of pretension made that theatre feel like a home to me during those two days of rehearsal and performance, in a way I still struggle to find, even as a professional playwright. My dad clapped louder than anyone else. I have a lot to thank that theatre for.Brad Birch: The Wyeside Arts Centre in Builth Wells was the place where I first experienced art as an event. And this would be the same for thousands of people in mid-Wales – the catchment area for the Wyeside is enormous – roughly 15 to 20 miles. It is the cinema, the comedy club, the theatre for an entire region of Wales and for me it was like a satellite from another world – bleeping out enchanting messages from other times and places. My first ever show as a playwright happened there. It was a moody adaptation of The Snow Queen for Mid Powys Youth Theatre. Under the rigorous and sincere artistic directorship of Ian Yeoman, MPYT served for many young people as a creative outlet and a precise education in the wonder and possibilities of socially conscious and humane theatre. Organisations across the country like MPYT are struggling to survive (MPYT lost its core funding when Theatr Powys closed in 2011), and I hope rural arts will not be forgotten when the Covid-19 support package is distributed.Christopher Haydon: I spent a year at the Salisbury Playhouse in 2007 as part of the Regional Theatre Young Director Scheme. One of my tasks was to be assistant director on the pantomime Robin Hood. I was initially sceptical – panto was hardly the kind of cutting-edge thing I thought I wanted to do. But I ended up loving it. They are hugely technical affairs, closer to musicals than plays. And the atmosphere in an auditorium of 400 children was alive, raw and raucous. Kids aren’t polite so you can’t fail in front of them and get away with it. I’d love walking through the foyer each morning and seeing old folk having coffee together while young mums watched their babies roll around on the floor. It felt like the building was essential to its community as more than just a place of entertainment. I get the same feeling now when I’m in the cafe at the Rose and see how many people rely on us each day for camaraderie and connection. Being in Salisbury taught me that the life of a theatre off the stage is just as important as what happens on it.Pooja Ghai: I was born in Kenya and came to Britain in the late-80s. As an actor and director, I have been lucky enough to work in many of our beautiful theatres. In 2017 I was invited by Emma Rice to direct Tanika Gupta’s epic political play Lions and Tigers at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. I had heard of it, but never been and I was unprepared for the surge of emotion as I walked into this beautiful candlelit Jacobean theatre, which opened in 2014. What an unlikely yet perfect setting for a play set in 1930s Bengal. The playhouse evoked a sense of India’s colonial history, even though it was built in the context of another era. This was the first time a South Asian writer and director had been invited to be part of the Wanamaker season, and it was the first time a story of our shared colonial history had been programmed in this space. It was a breakthrough moment, and a turning point in my career.Paule Constable: In 1991 I was overjoyed to be given my professional theatrical lighting design debut working on a production of The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui for 7:84 Scotland. They were heady days. The show was directed by Roanna Benn and designed by Rae Smith. We were kids, experimenting and making a show on the hoof. The company of six actors included two recent RSAMD graduates doing their first show – namely David Tennant and Ashley Jensen. We shipped out from the rehearsal space by Buchanan Street bus station in Glasgow – to open in Motherwell Civic theatre. The week before they’d been looking after the snooker. Now it was us. We didn’t manage a dress rehearsal. The actors played every part with false noses and wigs and a million tiny costume and prop changes. I remember the chaos of the first night – the bemused audience in Motherwell. It then set sail for the Highlands and Islands tour.

Two former Love Island contestants, Sophie Gradon and Mike Thalassitis, have also died.Knight, who referred to the more than 3,000 episodes of the Jeremy Kyle show as “human bear-baiting” and a “human freak show”, confronted McCall about why ITV kept the programme running for as long as it did.“It was a highly regulated show, it was a conflict-resolution show, it was not to everyone’s tastes, it polarised opinion,” she said. “It may surprise you to know that I actually got hundreds of emails complaining about stopping the show because they thought it was their own outlet of being able to listen and understand problems that were in their own lives. You may not empathise with that in any way.”Knight rounded on McCall for failing to condemn the show. “My jaw is dropping at the lack of contrition here from ITV and from yourself as chief executive.”McCall said the show attracted an audience of 1 million a day for 15 years and abided by the UK broadcasting code while admitting “it was not always comfortable to view, yet people viewed it”.“The Roman Coliseum held 55,000, it doesn’t mean because it was popular it was right,” said Knight. “I’m just surprised you can’t see that perhaps that was the wrong step and perhaps ITV should have ended it earlier, and perhaps we shouldn’t see its like on TV again.”McCall said: “I can’t talk for my predecessors, I can simply say that we stopped the Jeremy Kyle Show not because it had done anything out of regulation. It had not been criticised in the way that you (just) criticised it over that 15 years. I think a lot has changed I think if you look at the show today you wonder how it could have been on for so long. We have said that we will not be doing a show like the Jeremy Kyle Show again, we have been very clear about that, I have been very clear about that.”McCall said ITV had created a much more stringent duty of care plan for participants in shows such as Love Island, which went well beyond regulator Ofcom’s code, including tougher pre-screening of applicants, training on the risks of being in the public eye and a “huge focus” on continuing aftercare when a show finished.MP Kevin Brennan said the measures sounded like how you might cater for someone who has experienced post-traumatic stress disorder, and asked McCall if she would allow her own children appear on Love Island.“We are trying to prevent people coming back in to the world and not adapting back to it because their lives have changed a bit because of experiences they have had,” she said. You asked about my children, if they were completely apprised of it. as long as they went in completely apprised, completely with their eyes open, I wouldn’t say no.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/855421f222a82986bff081d504481f81eb7b2cee/0_3_3900_2342/master/3900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22a984e0020ca37593c06e9d2c5c8145","title":"the plot against america tv alternative alternate histories the man in the high castle","story":"The Plot Against America is the latest what-if series about the rise of fascism to arrive on our screens. But while some are sensitively-made, others risk glorifying disturbing beliefsStopping the world and getting off is what TV drama lets us do. Any fiction creates some kind of alternative reality, even if it’s just our own world with imaginary characters. But right now, the alternative history drama, where we exchange our present for a life in which humanity took a different path, is big. HBO’s The Plot Against America, based on Philip Roth’s novel, is just the latest show to comment on our current political reality by placing us at a hypothetical crossroads.Proper alternative histories take a pivotal event and change its outcome, the classic example being the result of the second world war. The allied victory is undone in Amazon’s The Man in the High Castle, and partly reversed in another of its series, Hunters, where the Nazis have lost but retain a network of operatives in the US. Shows such as The Handmaid’s Tale, which introduces a novel event (part of the US is taken over by an extreme religious dictatorship) rather than reshaping an existing one, aren’t alternative histories, but they perform the same function of providing a what-if warning.Alternative histories of whatever hue lean, inevitably at present, towards the theme of fascism. However, such shows can be rife with traps. Take Hunters, a queasy thriller that occasionally affords its story of 70s US neo-Nazis and their equally clandestine pursuers a questionable action-comedy vibe.Not only that, but it regularly features Nazis being so confident, capable and imaginative in their violent hatred that it’s hard not to be perversely impressed. It recalls murder dramas such as Hannibal, where we are encouraged to give killers marks for sadistic flair. Even with fictional culprits, that lingering gaze at brutality can be ethically questionable the way Hunters dreams up elaborate ways in which the Nazis might have killed Jewish people in concentration camps has rightly been criticised for a cavalier melding of the real and the imaginary. When you can imagine actual Nazis enjoying a show, perhaps it’s not “alternative” enough.Besides, it’s easy for alternative-world dramas to wheel out Nazis as cheap signifiers. Season three of Westworld this year widened the show’s universe to include a robot-staffed theme park where the impulses indulged by visitors were those of Italy’s wartime occupiers. Having dangled swastikas in front of the audience, however, the show didn’t say anything profound enough about Nazism to justify the specific referencing. In 2017, the BBC drama SS-GB started strongly with spooky shots of London under Hitler’s rule in a mirror 1940s, but then used the imagined occupation as a backdrop for a sludgy thriller in which fascism was sometimes not much more than a low-key bummer.However, some shows do follow through properly on the Nazi victory premise. The Man in the High Castle, based on Philip K Dick’s novel in which the US of the 60s is split between German and Japanese rule, is alternative history squared, featuring parallel universes. Rather than just being a device to gratuitously intensify the what-if intrigue, it becomes a clever way to give characters, and viewers, vivid lessons, learned with a glimpse at how different their lives could be. The increasingly central protagonist John Smith (Rufus Sewell), an American who becomes a high-ranking Nazi officer, tries to tell himself and others that his own moral responsibility is limited by the sweep of events. He tries not to acknowledge the victims of his actions. But seeing his alternative self making braver choices removes that comfort from him and forces him to face what he’s done.Instead of cartoonish “imagine if that happened” whimsy, the show aims for a fine-grained realism – as you’d expect from its showrunners, the creators of the Wire, David Simon and Ed Burns – majoring on how hard it is for people fighting on the same side of an existential battle to hold the same line, and how everyday life is infected and distorted by the pressure of worrying about what further horrors are on the horizon.This is alternative history at its most powerful, with echoes of Trump’s America pitched at a volume that’s not deafening, but which can’t be ignored. As The Plot Against America zeroes in on iniduals’ response to potentially cataclysmic political shifts, it’s less what if, and more … what now?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fad47eb071c989bb06f3c29352a1607f075a6fd/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7ae9d5ff44ebe213f9d1c1f49a64bf77","title":"action to stop winter covid 19 second wave in uk must start now","story":"Preparations to avoid second wave worst-case scenario in NHS hospitals ‘must start now’Britain must start “intense preparations” for a second wave of coronavirus that has the potential to kill as many as 120,000 hospital patients in a worst case scenario, experts have warned.Senior doctors and scientists convened by the Academy of Medical Sciences said on Tuesday that, without urgent action, a resurgence of cases this winter could overwhelm the NHS when services are already stretched because of flu and other seasonal pressures.The experts were commissioned by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, to model a “reasonable worst case scenario” for Covid-19 this winter. Their report, which has been shared with ministers and local health authorities, calls for immediate efforts to prepare for a second wave.Compiled by 37 experts, the report stresses the worst case scenario is not a prediction of what is likely to happen, but a description of how the outbreak may evolve if infections are allowed to surge and little is done to prepare the NHS and social care services.“The modelling suggests that deaths could be higher with a new wave of Covid-19 this winter, but the risk of this happening could be reduced if we take action immediately,” said Stephen Holgate, chair of the expert group and professor of immunopharmacology at the University of Southampton.“With relatively low numbers of Covid-19 cases at the moment, this is a critical window of opportunity to help us prepare for the worst that winter can throw at us.”The virus may bounce back in the winter as the weather and dark evenings force people to spend more time indoors. In the summer, it is easier to keep homes and offices ventilated with open windows which allow breezes to replenish stale air.The reasonable worst case scenario assumes that the R value, the average number of people an infected person passes the disease on to, roughly doubles from around 0.9 in England today to 1.7 across the UK in September.The modelling suggests hospital admissions and deaths would peak in January and February 2021 with a similar number of deaths as in the first wave.The modelling excludes deaths in care homes and the community, assumes no government intervention to prevent transmission, and does not factor in the use of dexamethasone, a drug recently shown to save lives in intensive care units.Further modelling in the report shows less severe second waves might lead to 1,300 or 75,000 deaths between September 2020 and June 2021 if the R value rises to 1.1 or 1.5 respectively.The report calls for a major public information campaign in the autumn to encourage people to prevent the virus from spreading. Hospitals and care homes will need better supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), widespread testing capacity and Covid-19-free zones.Because a second wave may coincide with the flu season, the experts said it was crucial that health and care workers, along with school children and all vulnerable iniduals, received the flu vaccine.The report came as Matt Hancock, the health secretary, claimed the government had procured enough vaccine to roll out the “biggest flu vaccination programme in history”.The NHS test and trace system must be ramped up in time for the winter, Holgate said, as more people will be falling ill with infections that resemble Covid-19, and near real-time surveillance should be in place to spot local outbreaks.“We do need to take this threat of a new wave of Covid-19 very seriously but, if we prepare now, there is a lot we can do to minimise the risk,” he said.Dame Anne Johnson, a co-author of the report and professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London, said there was a need for a powerful public information campaign that targeted specific communities as well as the nation as a whole.“Everybody needs to realise that Covid-19 hasn’t gone away, and therefore everybody can help reduce transmission by social distancing, by the wearing of face coverings as a social norm, by good respiratory and hand hygiene and the right level of heating and ventilation in our homes,” she said.Every winter hospitals experience a surge in patients as seasonal flu sweeps through the population, people have more falls on icy pavements, and the cold weather exacerbates health problems such as asthma, heart disease and lung conditions. “This winter we have to factor in the likelihood of another wave of coronavirus infections and the ongoing impacts of the first wave. We have to be prepared that we might also experience a flu epidemic this year,” Johnson said.“Faced with these potential challenges, and after an already tough year, it would be easy to feel hopeless and powerless,” she added. “But this report shows that we can act now to change things for the better. We need to minimise coronavirus and flu transmission everywhere, and especially in hospitals and care homes. We need to get our health and social care, and the track, trace and isolate programme, ready for winter. This can be done, but it must be done now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59704c0dd72c40beab529dce5b52348a76ab658c/0_178_4061_2435/master/4061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ce844066cb3ee62124767ba9a21f63b","title":"coronavirus spread airborne transmission covid 19 how do we stay safe","story":"Some scientists believe there is growing evidence of airborne transmission of Covid-19Some scientists are warning there is growing evidence of airborne transmission of coronavirus. But how does it affect the actions we should take to stay safe?According to the World Health Organization, airborne transmission involves tiny virus-containing droplets suspended in the air (aerosols) that linger for some time and are carried over distances greater than 1 metre on air currents.These droplets, less than five microns in diameter, contain less virus than large respiratory droplets, but unlike the latter they don’t fall rapidly to the ground.It is not clear. Some laboratory experiments have shown viable coronavirus can linger in aerosols for hours, but these are not “real-life conditions”.And while the WHO has said it is not possible to rule out that cases among people in crowded, poorly ventilated indoor environments such as restaurants, choir practice and fitness classes, were caused by aerosol-related spread, it said the clusters could be explained by transmission via large droplets.David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and chair of the WHO’s strategic and technical advisory group on infectious hazards, said transmission of Covid-19 was known to be possible by exposure to large droplets. However, while the disease could be spread by aerosols, he said there was little sign they travel far – except potentially in the case of aerosol-generating medical procedures.“There is limited evidence that aerosols generated by talking, coughing or sneezing can spread more than 1 metre, thus becoming airborne, and there is limited evidence that airborne transmission plays a role in the community spread of Covid-19,” he said.But not everyone agrees. In an open letter to the WHO last week, 239 scientists raised concerns over aerosol transmission, including over greater distances.“I don’t think you can explain some of the larger super-spreading events such as choir outbreaks other than by aerosols travelling greater than 1 metre,” said Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, and co-author of the letter.Heymann said cloth face coverings were important to protect other people from a wearer infected with Covid-19, particularly when social distancing is difficult – a measure that would also be important if the disease spreads by airborne transmission.To guard against infection of the wearer, N95 respirators are the best type of masks. As for infection through the eyes, experts warn face shields only protect against large droplets – but should be worn by people if up close to others for long periods, such as barbers.The authors of the open latter said hand washing and social distancing were important but also called for improvements in indoor ventilation, as well as the use of airborne infection controls such as air filters and UV lights.Catherine Noakes, a professor of environmental engineering for buildings at the University of Leeds, who signed the open letter, said there was little evidence of transmission of Covid-19 by aerosols over long distances but aerosols could still pose a risk across a room.Hunter added it could also mean social distancing of more than 2 metres, and widespread use of N95 masks in hospitals. The risk of catching Covid-19 is, generally, lower outdoors than indoors. In enclosed settings, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends keeping windows open or adjusting the air conditioning.Linda Bauld, a professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said good ventilation was going to be even more important as more places reopen, and could mean getting used to open windows even in the winter.“Evidence on air conditioning to date is not strong, but some systems that simply recirculate indoor air are likely to be of limited benefit and may pose risks, ,” said Bauld.A report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has concluded that heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems (HVACs) filter out large droplets containing the coronavirus, although the air flow could blow the droplets over a larger distance than they would travel in a still setting.The report also says such systems could spread Covid-19 aerosols if air is recirculated. But, it adds: “There is currently no evidence of human infection with Sars-CoV-2 caused by infectious aerosols distributed through the ventilation system ducts of HVACs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e44ed3216abee16a13720002571c089d22ec5f/0_0_5634_3380/master/5634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aade273b21399091cdef574ba6a372e5","title":"covid 19 restrictions are shattering argentinas short lived political truce","story":"Deep-seated rivalries resurfacing amid months of lockdowns Until recently, Argentina’s protracted coronavirus lockdown was marked by an unusual degree of harmony, as the country’s perennially squabbling political factions came together to contain the spread of Covid-19.But after nearly four months of consecutive lockdowns, rifts have begun to appear in that uneasy truce amid growing demands for a relaxation of quarantine measures. With new cases spiralling out of control, the old political rivalries between followers and detractors of the late three-time president Juan Perón, and his wife Evita, has returned to the fore.On one side, the Perónist administration of the president, Alberto Fernández, is struggling to keep its coronavirus lockdown in place after Argentina passed the 100,000 cases on Sunday – a four-fold increase from a month ago. On the other, an increasingly rebellious opposition and a defiant grassroots movement have been pressing for the end of quarantine rules.The president has expressed concern at the growing acrimony over Argentina’s lockdown. “No society fulfils its destiny among insults and ision, with hate as the common denominator,” he said on Thursday in an address marking Argentina’s national independence holiday.While Fernández spoke, thousands of Argentinians were taking to the streets in a nationwide protest that mixed simmering discontent over the long lockdown with anger against his Perónist administration.Anti-lockdown sentiment is being stoked by Fernández’s predecessor, Mauricio Macri, a pro-business politician who lost his bid for re-election last year.“We have seen a government that has tried during the pandemic to undermine freedom of expression, justice, independence of the branches of government and private property,” Macri said in a video posted on Twitter last week. “This has generated an active and strong reaction from society, which has mobilised to express itself against these actions.” Macri’s followers are displeased with a proposed one-time wealth tax to finance the cost of the pandemic, plans to expropriate the huge – but failing – grain trader Vicentin and the recent release, pending trial, of businessman Lázaro Báez and former economy minister Amado Boudou, both facing charges of corruption during the 2007 to 2015 presidency of the current vice-president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.“They are letting them walk free while we are under house arrest,” one protester told a television reporter in reference to the lockdown. Others carried banners that read: “Don’t let face masks silence democracy.”“Argentina has two realities,” health strategies under-secretary Alejandro Costa told the . “One is most of the country – where transmission has been brought under control – and the other is the Buenos Aires metropolitan area.”The metropolitan area consists of Argentina’s capital, Buenos Aires, a bastion of anti-Perónist sentiment governed by Macri’s Republican Proposal party for the last 13 years, with 3 million inhabitants – and its surrounding urban sprawl, known as Greater Buenos Aires, the backbone of Perónist support, with 11.8 million inhabitants, which falls under the jurisdiction of the province of Buenos Aires.“They are two separate but inisible districts,” said Costa.The pandemic has forced the city’s chief of government, Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, from Macri’s more conservative party, and Buenos Aires governor, Axel Kicillof, a Perónist firebrand, to coordinate health policies. But their uneasy cooperation, mediated by even-keeled president Fernández, is being tested by Larreta’s eagerness to ease the lockdown.Buenos Aires is planning a gradual reopening starting on Friday, despite reporting the highest incidence of coronavirus in Argentina. More than 38,000 city dwellers have tested positive so far – an average of three people per city block.Governor Kicillof is fearful the high level of contagion could spread to his province, where cases are numerically higher but proportionally much lower. “The province has only 0.3 contagions per hundred people, the city has one contagion per hundred,” Kicillof said at a recent press conference.Buenos Aires also leads Argentina’s mortality rate with 230 Covid-19-related deaths per million inhabitants, compared with about only 60 per million in Greater Buenos Aires and just 41 per million for all of Argentina.Public unease with the protracted lockdown, which started on 20 March, adds fuel to the fire. “The pandemic is being politicised, not by political leaders, who are cooperating harmoniously, but at a lower level,” says Martín Barrionuevo, a Perónist senator in the legislature of the province of Corrientes.With zero deaths and only 126 cases so far, Corrientes enjoys freedoms Buenos Aires residents can only dream of. “We can hold social gatherings of up to 10 people and restaurants are open,” says Barrionuevo.Fearful of the spread of the pandemic, the provinces are monitoring the transport of merchandise from Buenos Aires. “We have control posts on every highway, we test every truck driver,” Raúl Jalil, the governor of the northern province of Catamarca, said.Catamarca remained completely free of Covid-19 until earlier this month, when one infected driver slipped through the controls. With only 39 contagions and no deaths so far, Jalil is confident Catamarca can keep the outbreak contained. “We were the first province to make face masks mandatory and we were the last to get infected,” the governor said.“Our situation is totally different from Buenos Aires,” said Dr Carlos Bergallo, a member of Córdoba’s coronavirus task force. “Our car manufacturing plants, Fiat, Renault, Volkswagen, are operating. Shops, restaurants and shopping malls remain open, even if with restrictions.”Experts underline the higher population density in Buenos Aires as responsible for its predicament, but there may be other factors at play. “The response to guidelines from the people of Catamarca has been exceptional,” says Jalil. “We have a different attitude, perhaps because we are less arrogant than in the big cities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/844e821847d55667db028beee1c84e310654eec1/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b492940c81385b3fe24373fc73fdb8e8","title":"global coronavirus report restrictions return around world as cases pass 13m","story":"Hong Kong, California and Manila tighten rules WHO warns there are no shortcuts out of a pandemic Australia passes 10,000 casesCities and states around the world returned to tighter coronavirus restrictions to battle recurring outbreaks, as global infections passed 13 million and the World Health Organization warned there were “no shortcuts out of the pandemic”.Hong Kong will impose strict new social distancing measures from midnight on Tuesday, the most stringent there since the start of the pandemic, as authorities warned the risk of a large-scale outbreak was extremely high.The measures dictate that face masks will be mandatory for people using public transport and restaurants will no longer provide dine-in services and offer only takeaway after 6pm. Both are new rules that were not implemented during the city’s first and second coronavirus waves earlier this year. If a person does not wear a mask on public transport, they face a fine of HK$5,000 ($645).The new restrictions led to Hong Kong Disneyland being closed again, after reopening in June.In the Philippines, a quarter of a million people in Manila will return to lockdown in an attempt to stall the infection rate there. With just over 57,000 cases, the Philippines has the second highest number of infections in south-east Asia. Nearly 1,600 people have died in the country over the course of the pandemic so far.In the US, which has reported roughly 60,000 new cases a day for almost a week, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, California’s governor ordered all bars to close statewide and all restaurants, cinemas and museums to halt indoor operations, in a dramatic rolling back of reopening efforts as cases continue to surge.In addition to the statewide closures, the 30 counties on the state’s monitoring list must also shut down indoor operations at places of worship, fitness centres, hair salons, barbershops and malls.California is contending with a rapidly growing caseload the state has seen an average of 8,211 daily cases over the past week, a rise from the 7,876 average from the week before.The Trump administration ramped up its war with Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s top public health expert, over the handling of the crisis. The New York Times reported that about 5.4 million Americans lost health insurance in the pandemic, more than have ever lost coverage through job losses in a year, according to a new study.As Australia’s cases passed 10,000 on Tuesday, the state of New South Wales also introduced restrictions on bars, limiting group bookings to a maximum of 10 people, capping the maximum number of customers allowed in a venue at 300 people, and requiring large venues to have dedicated hygiene marshals in “distinctive clothing” to oversee social distancing, cleaning and hygiene at all times. The measures are partly in response to a new cluster at a Sydney pub called The Crossroads.NSW recorded 13 new cases as of Monday evening, in addition to 10 cases connected to the pub. The new restrictions will be enforced withe help of fines of up to AU$55,000 ($38,000), with further AU$27,500 penalties to apply for each additional day an offence continues.In the state of Victoria, staff from the private sector including airlines, telecommunications companies and banks, as well as 1,000 additional Australian defence force personnel, will be deployed to help efforts to contain Covid-19 after 270 new cases of the virus were identified overnight.Other key developments from around the globe include:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67b4daa267c1eb29415136a9483d11a5657d3632/0_119_3595_2158/master/3595.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4216d702d84e98436f2eadd32a953088","title":"in japan wearing a mask is habitual can the uk follow suit","story":"Japan has avoided Covid-19 disaster and people here accept masks – making the debate in the UK even more bewilderingAs a resident of a country where not wearing a mask is now akin to venturing out in one’s underwear, I’ve watched with growing exasperation the debate in the UK over whether wearing a face covering is a potentially effective defence against Covid-19.Although the benefits of hand hygiene and social distancing – two habits promoted by the World Health Organization in the early days of the pandemic – are widely accepted, it will take time to establish which combinations of factors, both official and cultural, have spared some countries while leaving others battling high numbers of infections and deaths.Japan, like South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, has so far avoided coronavirus catastrophe. Each has approached the pandemic in a different way, but they are united by a public acceptance, largely unprompted by the authorities, of mask wearing.While the Japanese government’s calls to avoid the three Cs – confined spaces, crowded places and close contact – are now, belatedly, being heeded in other countries, Japanese friends and family are baffled at the time it has taken Boris Johnson’s government to half-embrace the humble mask.The mass wearing of masks is habitual in Japan, beginning with the arrival of the flu season and continuing through the spring among the country’s legions of hay fever sufferers. In the case of flu, the logic is the same as that now being applied to Covid-19: not only does a mask hide runny, sore noses, it helps prevent the sufferer from spreading their germs, especially on packed commuter trains.As soon as it became clear, as long ago as February, that Japan’s encounter with coronavirus would not be confined to the passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess, it was hard to spot anyone in my Tokyo neighbourhood without a face covering. Most people opted for surgical masks with a thin metal strip that can be bent to fit snugly over the bridge of the nose.Masks of all shapes quickly disappeared from supermarket and pharmacy shelves, prompting the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to distribute two reusable cloth masks to every household in the country – a move met with more derision than gratitude.From home delivery staff to supermarket shelf-stackers and bank tellers, the mask has become a non-negotiable accoutrement to the regular work uniform.On my regular – and masked – bike rides, I keep a rough count of the number of other road users who are not similarly protected. By my wholly unscientific tally, mask loyalists easily outnumber the rebels, including among solitary drivers.Masks are back in plentiful supply, which is just as well. I will not leave my apartment without one stretched across my nose and mouth, knowing that sharing the lift with a neighbour or walking into the supermarket “barefaced” are luxuries lost to the pre-Covid era. Long before Johnson’s conversion to covering up in public, I sent several dozen disposable masks to my parents, along with regular entreaties to wear them when they decide the time is right to do some non-essential shopping.While people in the UK share a plethora of objections to mask wearing, Japan is bracing for several weeks of searing heat and humidity – the sort of conditions that can make a paper mask feel like an instrument of torture.Clothing firms are churning out lightweight “summer” versions, as medical experts warn about the risks of heat stroke and dehydration, especially among older people. Yet even when temperatures reach the mid-30s, I and most of my fellow Tokyoites will remain partially hidden behind those little white rectangles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69515f35b15605b8df59c84c8296b8acc7cb2846/0_85_4000_2401/master/4000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f968562bfadc9e6e0be32d49b8054bc","title":"uk health minister did not see 2017 pandemic report until guardian story","story":"Edward Argar says first time he saw Exercise Cygnus report that exposed governments lack of preparedness was in May A health minister has told MPs that the first time he saw a government report that disclosed the UK’s lack of preparedness for a coronavirus pandemic was when he read about it in the .Edward Argar, appearing before the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, was asked when he first read the findings of a report into Exercise Cygnus, a 2017 simulation of an influenza pandemic that forewarned the crisis in care homes.The report, which concluded starkly that Britain was not adequately prepared for a flu-like pandemic’s “extreme demands”, was disclosed by the  on 7 May.The report contained 26 key recommendations, including boosting the capacity of care homes and the numbers of staff available to work in them. It also warned of the challenge facing homes asked to take in patients from hospitals.William Wragg, the chair of the committee, asked when the findings of the report were circulated to ministers.Penny Mordaunt, the paymaster general, told the committee the report was circulated by her department after she came in to office in February.Wragg asked again: “That report is from a few years ago, so there has been plenty of time. Are you saying that ministers have not seen it? … Which ministers were sent a copy, for example?”Mordaunt said she could not be sure that ministers had seen a copy of the report which may not have been passed on by officials.“Health was the lead department at that time and should be able to tell you that. My understanding, having asked this question is that it was circulated to departments at the time but that does not mean it was necessarily put in front of ministers,” she said.“However, I know ministers who were on a particular sub-committee of the NSC would have seen that. That does not include all ministers. Health will be able to tell you.”Wragg replied: “I have seen a copy of the report. It was exactly the same as the copy of the report on the  website some months before, so I can confirm it exists. But what you seem to be painting is a picture that the report may have been circulated to departments but cannot say what learning was done and if that was disseminated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee53be0cf47eaf63bdabb20be8d5bb89af340a0/60_106_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c143dd31b2ddd31e098db8b5c8ec0b5","title":"worm found in tonsil of japanese woman with sore throat","story":"Near-4cm-long nematode roundworm is thought to have come from raw fishAn unpleasant sensation at the back of the throat can be a sign that a cold is on the way. But for one Tokyo woman, the cause of the pain was not a sniffle but a live worm that had lodged itself inside one of her tonsils.Doctors at St Luke’s International hospital in the Japanese capital removed the long black worm with tweezers after the patient had complained of throat pain and irritation, according to a case study published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.The worm, which was 38mm (1.5ins) long and 1mm wide, was still alive after being retrieved from the woman’s left tonsil, the journal said, adding that her “symptoms rapidly improved” after the procedure.The worm was identified as a nematode roundworm – one of several parasites that can infect people who eat raw fish or meat.The 25-year-old patient confirmed that she had eaten assorted sashimi five days before the worm was removed.According to the journal, doctors said the worm was a fourth-stage larva of the worm, adding that the infection had been caused by its younger incarnation as a third-stage larva that was present in her sashimi dish.The unfortunate diner is not alone. The authors of the study said the number of reported cases had “markedly increased worldwide” due to the growing popularity of sushi and sashimi.Similar infections are sometimes caused by raw or undercooked meat. Two years ago, a 34-year-old Japanese man became infected by roundworm parasites after eating seared chicken sashimi.

Saudi Arabian officials have said that the kingdom has seen a decrease in the number of new coronavirus cases over the past seven days.The kingdom recorded 2,692 new infections on Tuesday, the fourth day in a row the numbers have stayed below 3,000. Saudi Arabia has recorded a total of 237,803 cases with 2,283 deaths.The number of new daily infections had reached their highest point of 4,919 on 16 June, but those numbers have been steadily declining since early July, falling below 3,000 for the first time on 10 July.“We’ve noticed a decrease in the number of cases, and in particular the number of critical cases,” Health Ministry spokesman Mohammed Abdelali told a news conference.“We’ve noticed a stabilisation of the numbers of cases we’re monitoring and a decline in the curve.”Spain’s Catalonia region issued a new order to place around 160,000 residents of the Lleida area under confinement to stem a surge in coronavirus infections, defying a judge’s ruling that such a step was unlawful.The new restrictions, which still need to be approved by another judge after the conflicting orders provoked confusion among residents, would come into force in the city of Lleida and seven towns around it on Wednesday and last for 15 days, Catalan government spokeswoman Meritxell Budo said.The regional government was confident the judge would approve the new decree issued as it gives Catalan authorities a stronger legal footing in tackling outbreaks, she said.The new restrictions would only allow people to leave their homes for specific activities like working, buying groceries or exercising. Gatherings of more than 10 people would be banned, she said.Hotels would be closed, as well as restaurants and bars except for food pick-up or delivery.Residents of Lleida, which lies about 180 km (110 miles) west of Barcelona, have been blocked from leaving the area since 4 July amid a surge in coronavirus infections.As cases continued to rise, the regional government on Sunday attempted to confine citizens to their homes but a local judge struck down the order, spreading confusion among residents and further uncertainty among local businesses.Initially one of Europe’s worst hit countries by the pandemic and more than 28,400 people have died, Spain brought the crisis largely under control through a tough national lockdown that was lifted on 21 June.However, more than 170 localised outbreaks have been recorded since then, with 120 still active and with the Lleida region at the centre.Louisiana has emerged as a hotspot for the virus in the United States only months after seeming to contain its outbreak.The Republican vice president, Mike Pence, was scheduled to meet with Louisiana governor, John Bel Edwards, members of the congressional delegation and state health officials to talk about the states response to the disease.Pence’s visit comes as Louisiana’s confirmed virus cases surged worrying public health experts about the level of virus spread in a state that previously appeared successful in combating its outbreak.In response to the spike in virus cases and hospitalisations, Edwards enacted a statewide mask mandate for anyone aged over eight. He also returned bars to take-out and delivery only. Restaurants, casinos, gyms, salons and other businesses remain open with occupancy restrictions.Iran reports 179 new virus death as authorities announced a decision to once more shutter some businesses in the capital to contain the virus’ resurgence.The reimposition of restrictive measures comes after the government had progressively lifted them from April to reopen its sanctions-hit economy.The one-week measure in Tehran includes the closure of gyms, pools, zoos and cafes.“Holding any social, cultural and religious events and conferences is banned from today for a week,” deputy Tehran governor Hamidreza Goudarzi said.The Islamic republic has been struggling to contain the virus since announcing its first cases in mid-February.It has refrained from enforcing full lockdowns to stop the pandemic’s spread and resorted to closing schools, cancelling public events and banning movement between provinces in March before lifting them.Official figures have shown an upward trajectory in new confirmed cases since early May, when Iran hit a near two-month low in daily recorded infections.Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari raised the country’s overall Covid-19 death toll to 13,211 with the 179 fatalities recorded on Tuesday.She added that 2,521 people had tested positive for the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, raising the total cases confirmed to 262,173.The rising toll has prompted authorities to make masks mandatory in enclosed public spaces and to allow the hardest-hit provinces to reimpose restrictive measures, with Tehran being one of the latest. Masks will become mandatory in all enclosed public spaces in France within the next few weeks, President Emmanuel Macron has said in a major Bastille Day interview.Masks were already obligatory on public transport and recommended in shops, with many store owners refusing to welcome customers not wearing them. Macron said there were “signs that the virus is returning somewhat here and there”, with localised outbreaks causing concern among experts and fears of a further uptick as people leave for their summer holidays. Macron also said France was carrying out about 370,000 Covid-19 tests a week and had the capacity to do twice as many. Testing will soon be available to all without prescription, he said. A pattern emerging here. The northern Indian state of Bihar, which has a population of about 125 million people, will go into a 15-day lockdown to combat coronavirus, its deputy chief minister said on Tuesday.“Bihar government has decided on a 15-day lockdown from 16 July to 31 July. All city municipalities, district headquarters, block headquarters will stay under lockdown. The guidelines are being finalised,” Sushil Kumar Modi tweeted.The announcement came a few hours before the southern city and IT hub Bangalore was due to go into a week-long lockdown. Other states and cities have also imposed restrictions as India’s caseload nears 1 million.On Tuesday, Bihar reported a record 1,432 cases, the third consecutive day with more than 1,000 new infections, taking the impoverished state’s total to almost 19,000 with 134 deaths according to the local health authorities.“There is no medicine or vaccine for corona. We have to ensure that we cover our faces with masks, handkerchiefs or towels,” the deputy chief minister said.After imposing one of the world’s strictest lockdowns in late March, India has been steadily easing rules to lessen the huge economic impact, particularly on hundreds of millions of poor Indians who lost their jobs.But infections have continued to soar, passing 900,000 on Monday with almost 24,000 deaths, according to health ministry figures that many experts say underplay the severity of the situation.Thailand has suspended all inbound flights after an Egyptian soldier skipped self-quarantine and went to a shopping mall before testing positive for coronavirus. The kingdom has not recorded a domestic case of the virus for 50 days, winning praise for its strict lockdown which has so far controlled infections.The country had been gingerly reopening its airspace, hoping to use the low virus rates to tease back visitors to an economy flatlined by the collapse of tourism.But all inbound flights will be stopped after a group of Egyptian soldiers entered via the military-controlled U-Tapao airport, in Rayong province, without any virus screening.They were meant to self-quarantine at a hotel before flying out the next day but instead went to a nearby shopping mall. One soldier in the group later tested positive for the disease.Authorities are scrambling to trace about 1,700 people at the mall and the surrounding area.Prime minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha said he took “all responsibility” for the oversight and issued a rare apology for undermining the public’s “confidence and safety”.“It happened because people did not respect the rules,” he said during a televised address. “All inbound flights are halted – there are no more approvals until we can solve the problem.”The Egyptian man arrived on a military flight with 30 other officers on 10 July after a 24-hour round trip to Chengdu, China. They departed for Egypt the following morning.After this incident, a health ministry official said eight Egyptian military flights approved to travel through the kingdom later this month had been cancelled.India’s IT hub Bangalore was set to go into a new week-long lockdown on Tuesday as the number of coronavirus cases surged.After imposing one of the world’s strictest lockdowns in late March, India had been steadily easing rules to lessen the huge economic impact.But infections have continued to soar, passing 900,000 on Monday with almost 24,000 deaths, according to health ministry figures that many experts say underplay the severity of the situation.Bangalore, home to more than 13 million people, has emerged as a new hotspot and a seven-day lockdown in the southern city is set to begin today.Transport will be banned except for emergencies and only shops selling essential items allowed to open.Firms in Bangalore’s lifeblood IT sector handling the back-office operations of global corporations can operate, but with only 50 percent of staff allowed on premises at any one time.The western city of Pune has imposed a fresh lockdown after reporting a record 1,333 new infections on Monday and other states, including Uttar Pradesh, home to 200 million people, have also introduced new restrictions.Chinese authorities have pressed criminal charges against 23 people for illegal building alterations that led to the collapse of a quarantine hotel in which 29 people died and 42 were injured in March, state media reported Tuesday.The 66-room Xinjia Hotel in southern China’s Quanzhou city collapsed on 7 March, burying dozens of people who had been made to quarantine there because of their recent travel to regions hard hit by Covid-19.An official investigation found three floors had been added illegally to the hotel’s original four-story structure, and safety assessors had colluded with the hotel’s owner to produce false reports about the building, state broadcaster CCTV said.“Criminal enforcement measures” have been taken against 23 people involved with the construction, while local officials are being investigated for possible corruption connected to the collapse, according to CCTV.Quanzhou’s mayor, Wang Yongli, has been reprimanded for dereliction of duty, along with dozens of other civil servants, Fujian province’s official corruption watchdog said in a statement on Tuesday.The first floor of the hotel had been undergoing renovation since before the lunar new year holiday in January, and authorities in March said construction workers called the hotel’s owner minutes before the collapse to report a deformed pillar.China is no stranger to building collapses and deadly construction accidents that are typically blamed on the country’s rapid growth leading to builders cutting corners and the widespread flouting of safety rules.This report from France by our science editor, Ian Sample, looks into a French study of a baby boy infected with coronavirus in the wombThis is believed to be first such confirmed case but doctors say infant has made good recovery.

It called on all audience members who attended the performance to get tested.The producers of the play, “Werewolf”, released a statement on Monday also asking audience members to seek health advice.Good news from Pakistan, where officials say a polio vaccination programme will resume next week. The programme had been suspended because the country’s health system was overwhelmed by coronavirus. The anti-polio campaign would last three days, from next Monday, with the plan to have about 800,000 children vaccinated, AP reported the officials as saying. Police departments have received requests to ensure the safety of the polio workers.Polio vaccination teams and security escorts are routinely attacked by the Taliban and other militants who claim that the anti-polio drive is a Western conspiracy to sterilise children or collect intelligence.Pakistan had hoped to eliminate the disease by 2018, when only 12 cases were reported. But there was a surge in new cases the following year. Since January, Pakistan has reported 58 new polio cases from various parts of the country, including the northwestern region bordering Afghanistan.Pakistan has had more than 253,000 cases of the coronavirus, including 5,320 deaths, since the first infection was detected in February.In Buenos Aires, Uki Goñi reports that political factions that were briefly united in efforts to prevent the spread of Covid-19 are at loggerheads again:On one side, the Perónist administration of the president, Alberto Fernández, is struggling to keep its coronavirus lockdown in place after Argentina passed the 100,000 cases on Sunday – a four-fold increase from a month ago. On the other, an increasingly rebellious opposition and a defiant grassroots movement have been pressing for the end of quarantine rules...Anti-lockdown sentiment is being stoked by Fernández’s predecessor, Mauricio Macri, a pro-business politician who lost his bid for re-election last year.“We have seen a government that has tried during the pandemic to undermine freedom of expression, justice, independence of the branches of government and private property,” Macri said in a video posted on Twitter last week. “This has generated an active and strong reaction from society, which has mobilised to express itself against these actions.”With zero deaths and only 126 cases so far, Corrientes enjoys freedoms Buenos Aires residents can only dream of. “We can hold social gatherings of up to 10 people and restaurants are open,” says Martín Barrionuevo, a Perónist senator in the legislature of the province of Corrientes.Fearful of the spread of the pandemic, the provinces are monitoring the transport of merchandise from Buenos Aires. “We have control posts on every highway, we test every truck driver,” Raúl Jalil, the governor of the northern province of Catamarca, said.You can read the rest of Uki’s excellent piece here.Coronavirus has interrupted the education of around 10 million children in Afghanistan, leaving many without alternative learning options, the charity Save the Children has estimated.The charity’s assessment comes as the number of Covid-19 deaths surges in Kabul, even as violence rages on across the country.Save the Children said in a statement that the inability of attending school in addition to the job losses for many Afghan families “means that their children are having to work in the streets or marry early in order to support their families. Children must be studying safely in their homes through the most appropriate means.” Milan Dinic, Save the Children’s Afghanistan country director, said that while many countries seem to be bringing Covid-19 under control, the situation in Afghanistan is worsening.“The indirect impacts of Covid-19 on the lives of millions of children in Afghanistan cannot be ignored,” Dinic said. “Ten million have had their education interrupted while they see their parents and neighbours, struggling to cope with job losses and soaring food prices. Support is urgently needed across all areas – from income support for families to alternative education options for children.”The number of deaths from Covid-19 has risen by 24 from the previous day to stand at 1,062. In its latest update, the health ministry said the number of people who had tested positive for the virus had reached 34,740, an increase of 135 on the day before. There have been 21,454 recoveries.The number of daily infections has been dropping in recent days but the war-ravaged country’s capital is seeing a surge in the number of deaths. Kabul reported 19 deaths today. Kabul has been the country’s worst affected area, with 370 deaths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b487f6298ae93d44202b825f8a670866569fed/0_126_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f518095e322503bde96d36abf69c4f3b","title":"four young artists reveal how they express their unique voice in pictures","story":"As part of  Labs’ collaboration with Levi’s and young people with something to say, Gen Z illustrators and photographers discuss what informs their work‘We need a more erse understanding of the world’“I use my art to celebrate the lips, noses, hair and skin colour of women from black and mixed-race communities who have become stigmatised and criticised by society,” says illustrator Vicki Jones. “I believe everyone is beautiful and worthy of greater acceptance.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw A €15 million outdoor heated swimming pool on the river Liffey would be developed at “zero” cost to Dublin City Council, councillors have been told.The facility, which would include a cafe or bistro and saunas, is proposed for a site beside Seán O’Casey Bridge, next to the planned €23 million whitewater-rafting facility approved by city councillors last December.In recent days some councillors and community activists have opposed the pool plan, saying the money would be better spent on housing or community facilities.However, the council’s docklands area manager Derek Kelly on Monday said the project would be entirely privately funded and operated, and would not cost the council any money.“There is no intention of the city council to invest €15 million to do this ourselves,” Mr Kelly said. Outside of some expenditure on consultancy fees to establish if the project was viable, the cost to the council would be “zero” he said.“We need to tease it out to see if there is an appetite out there from the international market to do this.” Similar examples in New York, Helsinki and London had shown there were “plenty of people who design build operate and finance these”, he said.The council is proposing a €10 charge to use the pool, with concessions for those aged over 65 and families. The operator would pay an annual licence fee to the council for 30 years, after which ownership would revert to the council.Mr Kelly pointed out councillors had suggested an outdoor pool or lido be developed when the whitewater rafting project was proposed.SupportiveSeveral councillors representing the southeast of the city were supportive of the plan.“I think it does make sense. I like the project, I like big ideas, I think Dublin needs to have more big ideas,” Labour councillor Dermot Lacey said.Green Party councillor Claire Byrne said while she had concerns about water quality, she was “in theory” supportive of the project. “We can’t just condemn every big ambitious project that we are proposing for the city. We have to think big some times.”Independents4Change councillor Pat Dunne said, if properly run, the project “could enhance the facilities citizens of Dublin have”. However, he said the council needed to address the fact that its swimming pool in Crumlin was only open on a part-time basis.Fine Gael’s James Geoghegan said the proposal for a €15 million pool in the city felt like “two fingers to the people of Crumlin”. He said he had “deep, deep suspicions” as to who was behind the proposal. Independent councillor Mannix Flynn said the council should reflect on its associations with private funders following the collapse of the Parnell Square cultural quarter project. He added the Liffey waters were “unswimmable” last year.Fine Gael councillor Danny Byrne said the council should “stick to the knitting” and address issues such as vermin and weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"A beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creatures"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File photograph: CollinsTánaiste Leo Varadkar has said the Government is examining the possibility of bringing in random coronavirus testing for people travelling to Ireland from countries where the virus is not under control. Mr Varadkar said on Tuesday that mandatory testing for people travelling to Ireland from countries regarded as high risk for Covid-19 has not been ruled out but he was not sure if mandatory testing was practicable.That list is due to be finalised in the coming days ahead of the scheduled start of phase four of Covid-19 restrictions on July 20th. However, acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn warned on Monday that the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) would not necessarily recommend moving to the final phase of the country’s reopening, under which all pubs can resume trading. “I think we are concerned about the increase in cases over the last five days,” he said.The Government plans to produce the “green list” next week of countries that people can travel to without restrictions, Mr Varadkar added, “because you are no more likely to get the virus there than here.”For countries not on the “green list” or “A list”, the Government is examining the possibility of “bringing in random testing or testing in some cases as other countries have done because we know that mandatory testing is not possible in Ireland.”Mandatory testing would not be legally sound, he said. “We’ve seen for example in Australia it worked out very badly where the hotels where people have been detained have turned out to be clusters or sources of infections themselves.”QuarantineAt present people arriving into Ireland from abroad must by law fill in a form called the Covid-19 passenger locator form and can be jailed or fined if they do not or if they provide false information. However, mandatory quarantine is not part of the measure. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said that tourists should be told “don’t come this season” and that anyone arriving in the country should face mandatory 14-day quarantine.The island of Ireland cannot be left exposed and it was not enough to accept “on a wing and prayer” that people were self-quarantining, Ms McDonald told RTÉ radio’s Today with Sarah McInerney.Ms McDonald said that experts need to come up with alternatives and she accepted that tests produced false negatives. “I was that person myself.”Relying on a paper trail and making phone calls to verify where the person was, was not enough. Ms McDonald said she was in favour of every precaution necessary being taken to “protect our island.”Community transmission now appeared to be under control and the issue was the virus being brought into the country, she said.

Photograph: Getty ImagesThe number of charities registered in Ireland last year surpassed 10,000 for the first time, a new report by the Charities Regulator has said.According to its 2019 annual report, there were 10,514 charities registered in Ireland last year, an increase of 715 – or 7 per cent – on the previous year. It is the highest number of charities registered in Ireland since the regulator was established in October 2014.The most common charitable purpose of registered charities at the end of 2019 were purposes that were of benefit to the community (54 per cent), followed by the advancement of education (30 per cent), relief of poverty or economic hardship (9 per cent) and religion (7 per cent).Some 52 per cent of charities on the register had income of more than €100,000, 32 per cent had an income of between € 10,000 and € 100,000 and 16 per cent had an income of less than € 10,000.Some 2,165 charities reported an annual income of more than € 250,000 in 2019, and of these 875 reported an annual income in excess of € 1 million, up from 855 in 2018.About 72 per cent of charities on the register had fewer than 20 volunteers, 43 per cent of charities had no employees and 42 per cent reported having between one and 19 employees.A further 8 per cent of charities had 20-49 employees, 5 per cent had 50-249,while 2 per cent had 250-499.There were a total of 649 concerns raised with the Charities Regulator during 2019, of which 166 related to the issue of bogus clothing collections. This represented a 5 per cent decrease on the number of concerns raised in 2018.Of the concerns raised with the Charities Regulator in 2019, approximately 91 per cent related to issues in the combined categories of “legitimacy of charity”, “governance issues” and “financial control and transparency”.Helen Martin, chief executive of the Charities Regulator, said concerns regarding clothing collections constituted a “significant number” of the concerns received in 2019, resulting in a national radio campaign.“This particular campaign highlighted the importance of engaging with the wider public to tackle issues which have the potential to ert much needed donations from registered charities in Ireland,” she said.Ms Martin said a particular focus for the regulator today was the “challenge that Covid-19 represents”.“I would like to thank all those involved in the charity sector, from those working on the front line, to those supporting local communities across the country.“We will continue to monitor its impact on the sector, and we will provide information and guidance to charities as they navigate this very difficult period.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Thousands displaced after heavy rains trigger flash floodingMove after Japan\u0026rsquos capital records highest daily cases \u0026ndash 224 \u0026ndash since pandemic beganInfluential sister of Kim Jong-un says meeting makes no sense without reward for PyongyangMayor was reportedly subject of criminal investigation into sexual assault allegationsBilateral military deal driven by Tehran fury at bombs and arson blamed on US and IsraelBeijing calls on Australia to stop interfering following response to China imposing new security law in territoryGlory to Hong Kong, deemed to contain \u0026lsquostrong political messages\u0026rsquo, can no longer be sung or playedMost deaths have come from hardest-hit Kunamoto prefecturePM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeNew law leaves pro-democracy protesters unsure of where Beijing has redrawn the lineFourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsNorth Korea claims to have no cases of Covid-19 despite links with ChinaBeijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4304382.1594740590!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north macedonia holds first parliamentary election since name change","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A woman in front of the electoral billboard of the leader of the opposition VMRO-DPMNE Hristijan Mickovski in Skopje on Tuesday. Photograph: Georgi LicovskiEPANorth Macedonia will go to the polls on Wednesday as coronavirus threatens to weaken turnout in the country’s first parliamentary election since it changed its name, joined Nato and secured the European Union’s agreement to begin accession talks.The Balkan state formerly known as Macedonia agreed to the change in a 2018 deal with Greece – which has a region of the same name – prompting Athens to drop long-held objections to its neighbour’s bid for Nato and EU membership.In March, the country of two million people became Nato’s 30th member and finally received a green light for EU accession negotiations, which could start this year.The EU’s earlier delay in approving membership talks caused political upheaval in North Macedonia, however, prompting the resignation in January of a government led by the Social Democrats (SDSM) who had agreed the name change.The SDSM is now fighting to regain power against the right-wing VMRO-DPMNE, which also supports the country’s integration with Nato and the EU but fiercely opposed a deal with Greece that it still regards as a national humiliation.Surveys suggest that alliances led by both major parties will take about 20-25 per cent of votes, making a coalition government inevitable and placing the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) – the main representative of North Macedonia’s large ethnic Albanian minority – in the familiar position of kingmaker.The DUI has been part of coalition governments for most of its 19-year history, but it has raised the stakes this year by pushing for one of its members to become premier under a campaign slogan\u0026nbspthat translates as “Why not?”\u0026nbspThe next government is likely to be led, however, by former SDSM prime minister Zoran Zaev or VMRO-DPMNE chief Hristijan Mickoski, who have traded barbs during a campaign that has been overshadowed by the coronavirus pandemic.The election was postponed in April, but North Macedonia’s relative success in dealing with its initial outbreak has been undermined as lockdown restrictions have been eased ahead of the ballot.The country reported a record one-day rise in new cases of 205 last Friday, and the total number of people infected in North Macedonia has now reached 8,197, of whom 385 have died – giving it the highest such per capita figures in the region.Both main parties promise to fight the poverty and corruption that plague the country.“We have proved that North Macedonia could be a friend with everybody, made smart deals that brought the country into Nato and enabled a green light for the start of accession talks with the EU,” Mr Zaev said during the campaign.Mr Mickoski called the elections a chance to “decide on the future of our families” and “make our ancestors

Not enough people are even wearing masks.”The rise in Florida cases emerged hours after Mr Trump took swipes at health experts in his government leading the US response to the pandemic and his relationship further frayed with infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci.On Sunday, Florida reported a record increase of more than 15,000 new cases of Covid-19 in 24 hours.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

But even among the gold-standard trials that are available, the results are mixed.In May, the University of Hong Kong published an analysis of 10 RCTs looking at whether face masks prevented influenza transmission in the community. They found no significant reduction.A similar meta-analysis by the University of East Anglia (UEA), found wearing a face mask slightly reduces the odds of infection by the wearer, but only by roughly six per cent.Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at UEA and one of the authors of the study said: The value of face masks in the community is still an issue that the scientific community has not yet reached consensus on.  “Randomised controlled trials – the gold standard of scientific evidence – of face mask use in the community have not proven that mandating their widespread use is protective. Other types of study have given mixed results, some finding no benefit and others, like case control studies, generally finding them to be protective.However real-world data appears to show that masks may be effective. The University of Iowa found that the growth rate of coronavirus slowed down after masks were made compulsory in 15 US states and the District of Columbia. Likewise, Virginia Commonwealth University studied 198 countries and found lower death rates in those with compulsory mask-wearing, or in which face masks were considered culturally normal.Earlier this year, the Beijing Research Centre for Preventive Medicine found that if people wear face masks at home before they develop symptoms, it prevents transmission 79 per cent of the time. Yet after the onset of symptoms, masks make no difference. A paper published this month by The Royal Society, a learned society comprising many of the world\u0027s most eminent scientists and the oldest scientific academy in continuous existence, found that, overall, the use of cotton masks lowered the risk of infection by 54 per cent and the use of paper masks by 39 per cent.They found that the material and thickness was important, with effectiveness ranging from five to 95 per cent depending on the fabric, number of layers and fit. A double layer of cotton and chiffon performed best. Put simply, at least some transmission of coronavirus occurs in droplets from coughs, sneezes and even talking, so covering the nose and mouth stops an infected person projecting the virus into the air around them.In March the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that viral droplets expelled in coughs and sneezes can travel in a moist, warm atmosphere at speeds of 33ft to 100ft per second, creating a moving cloud that can  approximately 23ft to 27ft. The researchers warned that droplets can stay suspended in the air for hours, moving along airflow patterns created by ventilation or climate-control systems. Laboratory testing by Northeastern University, in Boston, found that surgical masks block out 75 per cent of respiratory-droplet-size particles, while the University of Hong Kong found that loose-fitting surgical masks block almost all contagious droplets breathed out by infectious people.Prof Rowland Kao, the chair of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh, said: Basic mechanical principles tell us that in indoor spaces, where air is relatively still, this effect is even more important. As we move towards larger concentrations of people coming together in indoor spaces, and as the rules on social distancing become relaxed, use of face masks has a potentially even greater role to play in reducing transmission.However it now appears that masks are better at preventing infected people from passing on the disease than helping to protect the wearer.One of the major scientific discoveries of the past few months is that there are huge numbers of people with the disease who are asymptomatic – maybe even as much as 80 per cent. Studies have found that viral load – the amount of virus present once a person has been infected and the virus has had time to replicate in their cells – peaks in the days before symptoms begin and that simply talking is enough to expel infectious droplets.A study by the National Institutes of Health in the US, using high-speed video, found that hundreds of droplets ranging from 20 to 500 micrometers were generated when saying a simple phrase. But nearly all of the droplets were stopped from spreading if the mouth was covered with a damp cloth. Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: Most masks will do a much less efficient job of protecting the wearer from breathing in droplets and no mask will stop you infecting yourself with your hands.In fact, if you spend a lot of time touching and adjusting your mask and your hands are contaminated, they could even increase your risk of self-inoculation.To make the situation more confusing, recommendations across Britain have varied considerably. On April 28, Scotland advised the public to wear face masks in enclosed spaces where social distancing is difficult to achieve, and imposed mandatory wearing on public transport as of June 22. On June 9, Wales also recommended that face coverings could be used where it might be difficult to stay two metres away from others and advised using three-layer, non-medical face coverings.England made wearing masks mandatory on public transport on June 15 but has so far stopped short of advising that they should be used elsewhere. Some scientists believe there is still not sufficient evidence to advise widespread use.Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London, said: The evidence has not changed in the last few weeks – it\u0027s still extremely weak. The question is why politicians may be changing their minds now.  My worry is that masks are a pretence to ease the lockdown to  help the economy. Lockdown is the only measure that is proven to work. If masks make people get closer, they may be dangerous.The constant need to be always moving your face covering to take a sip of beer could be a risk,” added UEA\u0027s Prof Hunter.Yet other experts think there is enough data now to suggest masks could be useful.Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said: A number of new studies and systematic reviews have persuaded most researchers and public health officials that they should be worn, including those who were sceptical a few months ago. Growing evidence on potential airborne transmission of the virus adds to the case for face coverings. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tim burton should have known better disturb delicate rural","story":"Poor Tim Burton. The multi-millionaire Hollywood director has made the mistake of infuriating his neighbours around his swanky country house at Sutton Courtenay in Oxfordshire, by erecting an ill-judged fence.It may be just three feet high and on land he owns, but the fact that it blocks access to much-loved walks, weirs and pools beside the Thames, enjoyed by generations of locals – through custom and practice, if not as a legal right of way – makes an acrimonious and damaging dispute inevitable. I have lived in the Warwickshire countryside for decades, and disputes over rural footpaths, bridleways, tracks and rights of way can take on an importance far greater than any national crisis. There is a delicate balance to country life that is all too easy to disturb.The eternal conflict between outsider and local is just the beginning of it. Whenever a famous city dweller moves to the country, there is always a yawning “them and us” ide between the “sleb” and the local “civilians”. When Jeremy Clarkson erted a footpath that passed near his picturesque lighthouse home, the locals fought and won a bitter legal battle to restore the former route. By contrast, the TV chef Gino D’Acampo won a similar fight in Hertfordshire earlier this year.But however provoking the seemingly dog-in-the manger attitudes of the likes of Clarkson and D’Acampo, we the walkers, riders and path-users also have a responsibility to keep our side of the unspoken bargain. There is a fragile network of competing interests desperate for access to rights of way, footpaths and bridleways and the laws, customs and expectations which govern them.During lockdown, the explosion of off-road cycling, particularly among city dwellers longing to escape their claustrophobic surroundings, intensified calls for cyclists to be allowed, as in Scotland, to use public footpaths. Hundreds of ramblers and dog-walkers now throng the traditional paths, and anti-social behaviour by a few bad apples is putting at risk the long-standing balance of consent.Much is a matter of civility. For years, many farmers have (on the whole) willingly maintained rights of way over their land in exchange for thoughtful behaviour from the beneficiaries. It is only when disrespectful walkers trample off the paths or allow uncontrolled dogs to worry livestock, or when phalanxes of thoughtless cyclists make bridleways no-go areas for riders, that the old contract breaks down.As freeborn yeomen (and women), we relish the right to go where we have always gone, even, as with hunting, over private land by permission of the owner. Most country people understand that we are there on sufferance.Within rural communities the tacit understanding has traditionally been that if those using the tracks, footpaths and bridleways, whether entitled to or not, do no damage, nothing will be said. However, once landowners and path-users begin their excruciating legal stand-offs, these old relationships are destroyed forever.Burton would be well advised to open up that treasured footpath once more – while the locals should show corresponding gratitude and respect. In the words of the old saying: “to each his space, but bounded by the space of others”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"debate should face masks compulsory shops writers have say","story":"To mask or not to mask? The Government is expected to announce that face coverings will become mandatory in shops from July 24, with flouters facing a £100 fine. So should Britons embrace the move as a necessary health precaution out of civic duty, or is it a scientifically spurious threat to our civil liberties?  contributors, Charlotte Gill and Benedict Spence, disagree... While the coronavirus disease remains active in the population, and we continue to know relatively little about it, precautions need to be taken. We can no longer accept a country in which everyone is forced to remain confined to their quarters. Businesses need to reopen, and life, insofar as it can, needs to carry on.If wearing masks for a period helps us to do that, then so be it. It is far from ideal, and offends our senses. It is anathema to us to stand by and allow the state to tell us to cover ourselves. A concealed face smacks of unaccountability, of shiftiness, of hostility, and so fosters suspicion.But if they prevent the spread of the virus, then we should wear them, not for ourselves, but for those whose lives are at risk. It may be a small number, but we are not so uncaring a society to say “to hell with them” in the name of personal liberty. With the rights and freedoms British people have fought for, come responsibilities to their fellow citizens. The British people are right to be suspicious the Government has not laid out a timetable or circumstances under which it will remove the necessity of wearing masks in shops or on public transport. It, clearly, is failing in its duty to us, and to make amends is taking a more draconian approach — one, you suspect, it doesn’t actually have the power to back up. We should resist the idea of a “new normal” — nothing about this is normal, and we should never allow it to be so. But it is precisely because it is abnormal that we should wear the masks for now. Sacrifices must be made by those who can bear them in times of strife. In the grand arc of our nation’s history, a cloth mask whilst buying food is hardly comparable to a gas mask in a bomb shelter during the Blitz.After weeks of pressure, from both the media and politicians, the Government appears to have caved in and decided to make face masks compulsory in shops. Many will say this is a sensible step, but the state has gone too far. The number of announcements and signs on the underground telling people to wear face masks are already quite enough!Call me overly optimistic, but I believe the Brits are generally a good bunch, who will always do their utmost to look out for their fellow citizens. They’ll wear face masks if they must, but the Government needs to present a compelling case. Where is the strong evidence for them in shops? Forcing compliance at the risk of a £100 fine (who would bother buying a pint of milk given the risks are so high?) will disillusion the public, as well as causing deep harm to local businesses.Michael Gove was completely correct, in fact, when he said that face masks should be a matter of common sense. Everyone seems to have forgotten that we all have this thing called “personal responsibility” in our daily lives. I fear this is the problem with the way the crisis has been handled. Yes, all governments had to radically intervene in the outbreak, but the result is they are now expected to officiate every part of our existence. Coronavirus could be with us for a long time. We should be withdrawing emergency powers, not extending them to Tesco.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 14th july 2020","story":"A puffin stuffs its beak full of fish and flies back to land.

On the steps of Parliament House after his dismissal, Mr Whitlam said “well may we say God Save The Queen, because nothing will save the Governor General”.The letter also revealed for the first time that Mr Whitlam called Buckingham Palace on the day of the dismissal.Mr Charteris wrote of the call: “Mr Whitlam prefaced his remarks by saying that he was speaking as a ‘private citizen’ ... and said that now supply had been passed he should be re-commissioned as Prime Minister so that he could choose his own time to call an election.”“He spoke calmly and did not ask me to make any approach to the Queen,” Mr Charteris wrote.Once dismissed, Mr Whitlam urged his supporters to “maintain your rage” but Labor lost the subsequent general election that year.Mr Whitlam’s Labor Party was elected as the Federal Government of Australia in 1972 after 23 years in Opposition. The Federal Labor Party had been severely weakened by a split in 1955.Once in office, Mr Whitlam and his ministers embarked on an aggressive campaign of reform.Domestically, Labor , among other things, abolished university fees, created a national Schools Commission to allocate federal funding to schools, established the National Sewerage Program, changed the constitution – by referendum – to give the Federal government authority to legislate on programs and policies pertaining to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, created a universal healthcare system Medibank – now known as Medicare - instituted uniform rail gauge lines across the country, and passed the Racial Discrimination Act.Internationally the government’s policies led one American commentator to write that no country had “reversed its posture in international affairs so totally without going through a domestic revolution”. As Opposition Leader on 1971 Mr Whitlam visited China, and in 1973 he became the first Australian Prime Minister to do so.Labor was re-elected in 1974, but lost control of the Senate when one of the party’s senators died and the government of Queensland defied convention by choosing his replacement, rather than sending the party’s preferred candidate.The government was rocked by scandals and by worsening economic crisis of 1973-75. The Opposition blocked supply in October, sabotaging Labor’s ability to govern effectively, which led to a constitutional crisis and, ultimately, the Governor-General’s intervention and dismissal of the government on 11 November, 1975.Mr Fricker, told local media that the National Archives released 20,000 records a year but received 40,000 requests a year.“I acknowledge the perseverance and dedication of Professor Jenny Hocking. And I want to say again on public record that, while for the past few years, for good reasons, I think, Jenny and I have been in opposite corners throughout this court case, however, never once have we disagreed on the value of the records or the extent to which they might illuminate the understanding of what is a tumultuous period in Australia’s history,” he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/14/12/sunak.jpg","title":"uk obr economy central scenario forecast coronavirus v shape recovery","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Office for Budget Responsibility\u0027s new projections show\u0026nbspa slower path of recovery and some permanent \u0027scarring\u0027\u0026nbspto the UK’s growth potential as a result of the crisisThe UK Government’s official forecaster is no longer expecting a V-shaped recovery in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown and now sees unemployment soaring to 3.5 million next year.The Office for Budget Responsibility’s more pessimistic “central scenario” published on Tuesday came as the latest official data from the Office for National Statistics showed economic output expanded by a “disappointing” 1.8 per cent in May.In April the OBR had published a scenario showing a record-breaking slump due to the lockdown but a very rapid bounce back in activity in the second half of this year and next year, taking the economy back to its pre-crisis growth path.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIs the UK economy heading for a V-shaped recovery?Yet it’s new central scenario, published as part of its regular Fiscal Sustainability Report, shows a slower path of recovery and some permanent “scarring” to the UK’s growth potential as a result of the crisis.The scenario has the level of UK economy activity still 3.6 per cent below that suggested by the pre-crisis GDP path by 2024.And the outlook for unemployment is worse, with the forecaster now seeing joblessness peaking at 12 per cent later this year as the Government’s furlough scheme is wound down, which would be the worst jobless rate seem in the UK since the mass unemployment of the 1980s.In April the OBR had pencilled in a joblessness peak of 10 per cent this year.A serious concern for ministers and trade unions will be the fact that the OBR’s central scenario shows 15 per cent of the 9.4 million currently furloughed jobs being permanently lost as the scheme ends in the coming months.James Smith of the Resolution Foundation said that this projection should prompt the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to take further action to support jobs in vulnerable sectors of the economy such as hospitality and that his failure to do so in last week’s Summer Statement represented a “significant gamble”.The OBR said that the new spending measures unveiled in the Summer Statement will help take the UK government’s total borrowing in 2020-21 to £370bn, or between 15 and 23 per cent of GDP depending on the shape of the recovery.That higher rate would represent easily the highest UK public borrowing since the Second World War.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley says he is “upset, annoyed and baffled” by the decision to replace him as the broadcaster’s senior football commentator.The channel announced on Tuesday that Sam Matterface will step up to replace Tyldesley as their chief commentator, and that although the veteran broadcaster would remain a part of their football plans, he would no longer be the first choice for their England games and coverage of World Cup and European Championship fixtures.The 65-year-old first worked with ITV early in his broadcast career before switching to the BBC in the early 1990s, but retired in 1996 before going on to become their main voice on football, having covered some of the defining European and international moments in the sport’s recent history.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut having first been told of the decision three weeks ago, Tydlesley addressed the decision for the first time in an emotional video on social media, in which he said that he has struggled to understand the reasons for the decision given that he has not been told any.“If you haven’t seen the announcement I am being replaced as ITV’s senior football commentator,” Tyldesley said in a video posted to his Twitter page.Clive Tyldesley replaced as ITV’s chief commentator after 22 yearsTyldesley calls for commentary training after study finds racial biasClive Tyldesley on racism, Twitter vultures and finding the right word“Quite a few people have been in touch with me asking me to react, to comment. I’m not sure that would be a very good idea at the moment.“I was told about three weeks ago so I have had some time to get my head around the decision, but I haven’t got my head around it. To be clear, this is ITV’s decision, not mine, and I’m upset, annoyed, baffled.”The announcement came three days after what should have been the Euro 2020 final, which Tyldesley would almost certainly have commentated on, and he confirmed that there are no plans for retirement or complications with ill health on his side that have have played a factor in the move.“I would have been interested with commentating the Euro 2020 final for them less than 48 horus ago but now I won’t be commentating on any of the big England games in the coming year and I’m going to miss them. I love this job, and it’s gone,” he added.“Why? I don’t know. I do not know exactly why this decision has been taken. Already I’ve had the producer of a broadcaster that I am working on asking me if I have got any health issues. No, I have got no health issues. Asking me if it is something that I have done. No, there’s nothing.“I gather that one or two sites are reporting that I’ve been sacked, well I guess I have from one job but I’ve done nothing wrong. I’m the same broadcaster, the same person that I’ve always been. Like me or hate me and you’re entitled to do either. Like everybody else in football I am a matter of opinion and I totally get that, and I totally respect ITV’s right to change their opinion of me. ITV have been really good for me and yes I’ll carry on as their No 2 commentator.“But let me make it quite clear: I have not stepped down. I have been moved, moved aside. I’ve not even thought about winding down towards retirement or anything like that.”ITV have not given their reasons for demoting Tyldesley for Matterface, with director of ITV Sport Niall Sloane only saying “on behalf of ITV Sport, I would like to thank Clive for his superb work leading our commentary on some of the biggest occasions in world football throughout his outstanding career with us.”Sloane added that ITV are “very glad he will continue with is and look forward to working with him on many more occasions in the future”, but while Tyldesley was keen to stress that he remains in a privileged position given the number of people currently without employment, the pain of losing his his role hurts nonetheless.“Now listen, there are thousands of people in this country facing up to job losses and disappointment that is far more serious than this,” he said. “I am a lucky boy, I love my work and I’ve got plenty on, so I’m not making a statement or anything like that. This is not a grave matter of state, I’m just trying to explain and tell you that I’m really, really disappointed about this. I don’t know why I’m being replaced, I’m well, I’m able, I’m available and I’m just going to miss the England games so much, even more than I miss the Champions League games, and that’s all.”The latest football headlines direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The anomalous figures from South America may be due to the pandemic\u0027s effect on already volatile economies, according to Invezz’s David Merry.“The impact that Covid-19 has had on the industry is huge, the numbers speak for themselves,” he said.Many countries such as Russia and China are down as much as half when compared to last year. However, Covid-19 has also further exacerbated existing geopolitical issues within South America, and this may well have caused an interesting spike in bitcoin trading activity.This trend is only further likely to continue, with many Latin American countries such as Venezuela, now adopting cryptocurrency to help alleviate the issues of hyperinflation.Venezuela actually saw a slight drop in bitcoin trading, however its already high volumes means it is now second only to Russia in terms of trading volume.The country\u0027s economy has been in free-fall for several years, made worse by crippling economic sanctions imposed by the UK and US.Bitcoin overtakes gold to become the best performing asset of 2020Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate hit 10 million per cent in 2019, prompting many people to turn to cryptocurrencies as a more stable medium of exchange.Since 1 June, 2020, an estimated 20,000 shops and businesses in the country now accept payments via bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It puts the UK firmly on the side of the US, which has already imposed sanctions on the company.But aside from the geopolitics of the issue, the decision could mean significant changes for anyone who uses a phone in the UK.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHuawei itself has described the decision as bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone. But the government has said that it was necessary to protect exactly those citizens, and that it will work to minimise disruption.The ban means that buying new Huawei 5G equipment will be banned at the end of the year, and that all Huawei equipment must be removed from UK 5G networks by the end of 2027. The existing ban on Huawei kit from the most sensitive core parts of the network is still in place.But for daily users, most obvious and probably significant change is that the work to strip Huawei out of the 5G network will delay the rollout of that technology by two to three years, as well as costing billions of pounds.The introduction of 5G has been widely hailed as a potentially transformative technology, since it allows for much faster connections, not only for phones but for any other device that can talk to the internet. That extra speed for the moment remains largely in the future: very few phones are currently able to use 5G networks, and the rollout of devices as well as the network is likely to be slow, meaning that the delay will probably hit fewer people than it would if it affected 4G networks, for example.(Huawei does provide equipment used in those existing 4G networks, but that is not covered by the new ban, despite complaints by some MPs such as Iain Duncan Smith that it should be. As such, those far more popular networks which are used by most modern smartphones should continue working as normal.)Boris Johnson orders Huawei removal from 5G network in major U-turnWith any delay to the infrastructure, users may not be able to get the full value out of their 5G phones, some of which are already out, but many more of which will arrive over the coming months. Some of the more revolutionary applications for 5G – which have included the suggestion that small devices could be given reliable internet connections to make them smart, and the ability to conduct even surgery remotely – might also be held back if the technology is not there.As such, the Huawei ban is less likely to affect any technology you currently have, or rely on. Instead, the main difference it will make is when certain new products arrive or become useful in the future – or whether they will arrive at all.Apart from the delay in its introduction, there is likely to be no obvious change as a result of the move away from Huawei equipment. The products that power the infrastructure underlying mobile data connections are largely invisible to users, and the new network is expected to function in the same way after the change is complete.Other companies are theoretically able to offer the same coverage and functions, and to take over from Huawei. Some have already committed to work in Huawei\u0027s stead, with Arun Bansal, Ericsson\u0027s president of Europe and Latin America, saying that it stands ready to work with the UK operators to meet their timetable, with no disruption to customers.The US\u0027s actions, which led to the ban in the UK, also affect Huawei equipment that is used in fibre broadband networks, such as those that provide home WiFi. But the government indicated that it would only advise that operators transition away from using new Huawei equipment, rather than requiring old equipment to be quickly changed, as with the 5G network.Taking that approach will help to support the connections that the public relies on, the government said, while still address the security concerns about Huawei equipment.The government said that those compromises were required to ensure that the network was safe, even if it also meant that it would not be available as soon as expected.“5G will be transformative for our country, but only if we have confidence in the security and resilience of the infrastructure it is built upon, said Oliver Dowden, the digital secretary.Created with Sketch.Europe replicated in Huawei City, China Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, Germany28 Replica Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei City, China48 Replica Heidelberg in Huawei City, China68 Replica Cesky Krumlov in Huawei City, China88 Replica Heidelberg in Huawei City, China18 Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, Germany28 Replica Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei City, China48 Replica Heidelberg in Huawei City, China68 Replica Cesky Krumlov in Huawei City, China88 Replica Heidelberg in Huawei City, China“Following US sanctions against Huawei and updated technical advice from our cyber experts, the government has decided it is necessary to ban Huawei from our 5G networks. “No new kit is to be added from January 2021, and UK 5G networks will be Huawei free by the end of 2027. This decisive move provides the industry with the clarity and certainty it needs to get on with delivering 5G across the UK.The announcement only covers Huawei equipment used in the phone network\u0027s infrastructure, and not Huawei\u0027s phones themselves. They remain on sale in the UK – though because of a ban on Google providing products to the company, they are unable to use Android on new devices, and so the phones may not be as fully featured as they would be without the ongoing fallout.Huawei attacked the decision, but committed to continue to support our customers.This disappointing decision is bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone. It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital ide. Instead of ‘levelling up’ the government is levelling down and we urge them to reconsider. We remain confident that the new US restrictions would not have affected the resilience or security of the products we supply to the UK, said Ed Brewster, a spokesperson for Huawei UK.Regrettably our future in the UK has become politicised, this is about US trade policy and not security.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA snap poll by YouGov conducted on Monday before the announcement found that 60 per cent of people back making masks mandatory compared to 34 per cent who think they should be optional.But prominent Conservatives, some taking their cues from the United States where conspiracy theories about coronavirus have gone mainstream, took to social media to vent their frustration.Face masks: why was Britain the last to do the right thing yet again?Man in MAGA hat flashes his gun when asked to wear a maskEverything you need to know as England makes face coverings compulsoryDouglas Carswell, a former Tory MP, responded to the announcement by declaring he would no longer be shopping.Oh well, he tweeted. No more going to the shops for me.Longtime Conservative-supporting journalists Toby Young pledged ahead of the announcement that he was never voting Tory again if the ban came in. He described masks as mandatory face nappies  Activists and party members posted pictures of their membership cards cut into pieces or with angry messages scribbled onto them.Francis Hoar, a Tory-supported barrister, posted a photograph of his card online, stating: It may only be one straw, but there comes a point where any association with this government must end.

I just object to being told what to do.Dominey Jenner, a stay-at-home mother and former teacher from Wimbledon, south-west London, told the same agency that she had been quite sceptical about the lockdown but that the new policy on face masks was the final straw.If you look at the statistics regarding the cases and the death rate, which is plummeting ... why now you would bring in mandatory face masks? she said.The other strand for me is the libertarian strand. I think people should be trusted, I think we should be given a choice.I\u0027m really angry at how the Government has invoked fear in its population to control people – I think that is the wrong way to manage a population and to govern.Outgoing member Lyndsay Hopkins, who posted a picture of her card, said: I was disappointed in Theresa May but Boris Johnson is on another scale. I will never vote Conservative again. Am now politically homeless.One anonymous Twitter account going by Lord Bob posted a picture of Tory membership card with Shove ur mask up ur a***, c***s written on it in black felt tip pen. He later posted another picture of it cut into pieces.Another social media user posting a picture of their card said: I only went back to the Tories, because of Johnson. I’ll never vote for them again, because of Johnson.Overall Tory voters are slightly more sceptical of the policy than the general public, polling shows – though they still support it overall.57 per cent of Tory voters want mask-wearing to be made compulsory compared to 40 per cent who think it should be optional. Labour voters support compulsion by 65 per cent to 27 per cent, according to a breakdown provided by YouGov. Leave voters in particular are somewhat sceptical, but again still clearly positive, with 55 per cent in favour of making wearing masks mandatory and 42 per cent against.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I trust people’s good sense.”The cabinet office minister also revealed the government was significantly boosting the manufacture of face coverings, with factories “in Wales and Burnley”.Vaccine doses for all ‘in first half of next year’ if trials succeedThe government has been accused of spreading confusion on the issue, with only 36 per cent of Britons wearing coverings in public places – far short of the numbers in France (78 per cent) and Italy (83 per cent).Some scientists had welcomed the prime minister’s hints at being ‘stricter”, when he said: “We are looking at ways of making sure that people really do have face coverings in shops, for instance, where there is a risk of transmission.”Professor Venki Ramakrishnan, president of The Royal Society, said everyone’s mouth and nose should be covered in public, to reduce the risk of a second wave of coronavirus.The World Health Organisation said last week that there is “emerging evidence” that infections could be spread through particles travelling through the air.Speaking on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show, Mr Gove said “If tough measures are required, as we have seen in Leicester ... then tough measures will be taken.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We already have it on public transport,” she said.Mr Gove also confirmed the government wanted people to return to work, rather than stay at home, to ensure the “economic engines of this country are fired up again”.“We want to see more people back at work, on the shop floor, in the office, wherever they can be,” he told Sky News.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.The team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The provincial agricultural department said in a statement that the dog meat trade had descended into “anarchy” in recent years, causing rabies and other diseases to spread from region to region.The department said in a statement that the “catching, buying, selling and slaughtering of dogs” would be punished “severely”, with maximum penalties including five years in prison and fines of up to 50 million riel (approximately £9,700).Dr Katherine Polak, head of Four Paws, said: “The historic decision by the Siem Reap government to ban the stealing, trading and killing of dogs is a huge milestone for animal welfare in Cambodia and is reflective of current sentiment among Khmer people.UN warns of ‘steady stream’ of infectious zoonotic diseases‘If we don’t buy, they don’t die’: Tackling the wildlife trade demandCan social media be weaponised against the illegal wildlife trade?Prince William backs report to ‘end the illegal wildlife trade’Yulin Dog Meat Festival: How did it start and will it get banned?“We hope that Siem Reap will serve as a model for the rest of the country to follow suit to protect the lives of millions of dogs.”The dog meat industry in Cambodia sees an estimated three million dogs slaughtered for consumption annually. Thousands of animals are transported from Siem Reap to different parts of the country each month, including to the capital, Phnom Penh.Tea Kimsoth, director of the provincial agriculture, forestry and fisheries department, told Reuters that demand for the meat was driven by foreigners, especially South Korean visitors to the country.“They like it, that’s why it led to restaurants serving it, so now we ban it,” he said, adding that the trade was “alarming”.The Cambodian province’s decision follows China recent ban on the sale of dog and cat meat. The animals were kept in poor conditions, making them vulnerable to disease that could be transmitted to humans, said activists.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Activist leaders said some elements of the law appeared tailor-made to outlaw their activities.Another former leader of Demosisto, Nathan Law, was not in Hong Kong for the primary. He revealed on Twitter that he is now in London, having fled a week and a half ago.Like Wong, Law rose to prominence during the 2014 protests and was at the forefront of demonstrations against an unpopular proposed extradition law last year.He wrote on Twitter that he was staying in a “little apartment” in the UK capital and that he had met some reporters. At the start of the month he testified about the situation in Hong Kong to a US congressional committee, appearing virtually from a then-undisclosed location.Law explained that he had kept his whereabouts secret to “mitigate the risks” in the aftermath of Beijing passing its new Hong Kong law, adding that he had put himself in “danger” by continuing to speak out. “We don\u0027t even know if our next protest, next court hearing, will be followed by imprisonment,” he said.Also on Monday, Sweden joined France and Germany in pushing for a united EU response to China’s moves in Hong Kong, with Swedish foreign minister Anne Linde saying “we need to react to what is happening”.After a meeting in Brussels, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said foreign ministers had agreed “to develop a coordinated European Union response to show support for Hong Kong’s autonomy and civil society”. He told reporters nothing had yet been decided, however, and that the response would stop short of economic sanctions.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Boris says: “The balance of scientic opinion has shted in favour of them.”But as they could tell you in Japan or South Korea, a mask protects other people from whatever bug you are carrying.They also send a powerful psychological message: “I take this horrible disease seriously and so should you.”And I can exclusively reveal that wearing a face mask has not shrunk my manhood.But still men — women are more pragmatic — recoil from face condoms. Research at Middlesex University concluded that men are less likely to wear masks than women because blokes think it “is shameful, not cool, a sign of weakness and a stigma”.Signicantly, it is those nations with no face mask culture where the coronavirus death toll is truly horric.We don’t need the ever-changing science to tell us masks work. Common sense tells us masks work. As do death tolls.In the US, , dead. In the UK, , dead.And in Brazil, where hard-man president Jair Bolsonaro disparaged face masks right up until the moment he caught Covid- — now you can’t get El Presidente out of one — they have , dead.But in nations where wearing face masks is widespread, the number of deaths is tiny.In Japan and South Koreathere are fewer than , and  dead respectively.But in England and Wales, despite the PM’s hints, you STILL don’t have to wear a face mask in shops. It is heartbreaking that the West has not caught on quick enough.In Asia, masks are not worn to protect the wearer. They are worn to protect everybody .My Japanese we believes Western countries have not got the face mask habit because, to us, nothing is more important than the inidual.Yet in Japan and South Korea — and, indeed, China — the inidual is less important than the wider society.You don’t wear a face mask for yourself. You wear it for everyone .Misplaced machismo is killing us. Trump’s administration is strident in its anti-mask ideology.Vice-President Mike Pence skipped wearing a mask to visit a nursing home with Covid- patients. Pence was delivering boxes of personal protective equipment.And he is the US’s coronavirus task force leader! No wonder America has , dead.From shops to cafes to gyms, our old world is ing to le. To some degree, we are all struggling with FOGO — fear of going out — and face masks can only ease that anxiety and make us all safer.We have left it very late in this country but this is the perfect moment for us to finally get the face mask habit.Yes, even men.

They need our help.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWe can all play a part in saving our towns and cities.If we head out to eat, drink and shop, we can throw a leline to businesses on the edge.It’s our patriotic duty to get back to the pub.For years, town centres have struggled because it is hard for shops to compete with the online retail giants.The switch from old-style shopping to ordering online has sped up in lockdown.The Government’s massive programme of economic support has helped many businesses survive.A total of £.billion in grants has been paid to more than , firms, mainly in hospitality and retail.The Government is also paying the wages of .million people through the furlough scheme.I have heard from small businesses in my Chipping Barnet constituency in Greater London how vital this help has been in getting them through lockdown.But the only long-term way to save these businesses is for customers to start heading through their doors again.That is why I was one of the first MPs to call for the lockdown to be lted.Now that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has given us the freedom to go back to work and back into town, we need to use it.With so many still working from home, our city centres feel like ghost towns.Jobs are already going or under threat at many familiar big names, from Boots and Burger King to Pret and John Lewis.Taxi drivers, caterers, news vendors, cleaners, millions of livelihoods depend on bustl-ing offices and workplaces filled with people.The situation is very grave. Economists are predicting one of the worst global recessions since records began, with up to .million Brits potentially losing jobs.All the evidence indicates that prosperity is driven by successful cities.If tumbleweed continues to roll through London’s world-class tourist attractions,Manchester’s bars and clubs are half empty,Newcastle’s nightle remains muted, then pulling ourselves out of recession will be far harder.For the sake of all our great cities, we need office workers back at their desks.Of course, it is vital that we behave responsibly and respect social-distancing rules.Huge care has been taken to ensure the process of lting the lockdown is a cautious and gradual one, with some £million being spent to make the high street safe and ready to welcome people back.And I pay tribute to the massive efforts being made by businesses doing everything possible to make their premises Covid-secure to keep their workers and customers safe.I know their reluctance toto public transport. I see that every day as I commute to Westminster on near-empty Tube carriages.But the simple precautions of wearing a face covering and washing your hands thoroughly when you reach your destination can help keep you and others safe.Nothing in le comes without some risk, but the steady fall in Covid cases means that, for the vast majority of us, the risk of catching the virus is getting lower every day.So people should feel confident to go out to their workplace again, and they should also feel happy and secure about grabbing a bite to eat with friends in a cafe.This could be make or break for your city centre.Unless you come to the rescue by spending some money to support these local businesses, they could go under for ever.Saving our city and town centres isn’t just about jobs and the economy.They are the heart of community le.As an example, for many elderly people, popping out to the shops is a hugely important social contact, especiallythey do not have family living nearby.If our town centres become a row of empty shops and boarded-up pubs, that is a heartbreaking loss for our whole community.It would leave all of us more isolated from our neighbours.When the pandemic hit, this country came together in an incredible united effort to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Now we need to show that same determination when it comes to reviving the economy, saving jobs and supporting businesses in our villages, towns and cities.That means starting up the commute again and getting back to the office.It’s not every day that the Chancellor of the Exchequer says he will knock £ off our lunch bills.But that is what will happen during August.Soyou value your local High Street and want to see it thrive in the future, then head there and eat out to help out.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This letter is the proof to me that were moving forward.Amal said it was a shame that in  that he did not feel comfortable sharing his whole story.Hes very afraid to tell anyone , she said.His family knows and thats what is important to him now... for now he doesnt think its something people will accept and people will understand.Amal said the player is worried about the negative backlash he thinks he will receivehe comes out publicly.After his letter was published in The Sun, the player said he was relieved that his feelings had been made public.Amal said of the player: “He is relieved because it’s out there and has been done sensitively.”She also revealed the charity had been deluged by messages of support and offers to help.The player, one of seven the foundation is helping, said the secret was harming his mental health and he was considering retiring early so he can be open about his sexuality.He said: “The truth is I don’t think football is ready yet for a player to come out.”His letter was aimed at authorities and fans, in which he said he was taking the huge step of opening up over his ordeal.But he says football is not ready for an openly gay player and he is scared to become the first to come out while still playing in the Premier League.CAMPAIGNING charity Stonewall praised “real movement within football” — but said attitudes still need to change across sport before everyone “feels free to be themselves”.They added: “It’s vital that allies — fans, players, clubs and leading organisations — come out in support of LGBT rights and make sport a more accepting environment for all LGBT people. The burden of social change can’t solely lie on the shoulders of LGBT athletes.“The more support there is, the easier it will become for athletes to be open about their sexuality.“That’s why our Rainbow Laces campaign focuses on getting more people to be visible and fierce supporters of LGBT equality in sport.“Our work will not be finished until all LGBT people — from fans to players alike — are accepted without exception.”He is being supported by the Justin Fashanu Foundation, run by the tragic footballer’s niece Amal.The charity, fighting homophobia and racism in football, handed us the letter to raise awareness of the issues facing gay stars.In the letter, the player wrote: “I am gay. Even writing that down in this letter is a big step for me.But only my family members and a select group of friends are aware of my sexuality. I don’t feel ready to share it with my team or my manager.”He goes on: “How does it feel having to live like this  Day-to-day, it can be an absolute nightmare. And it is affecting my mental health more and more.“I feel trapped and my fear is disclosing the truth about what I am will only make things worse.”There are currently no openly gay or bisexual male professional footballers in the UK.But Watford captain Troy Deeney believes every team has at least one — and backed them to come out.He said: “Once the first comes out, there would be loads.”The PFA said it “welcomes the opportunity to work alongside any player who chooses to come out”.The FA offered its “full support”.AS a kid, all I ever wanted to be was a footballer.I wasn’t interested in doing well at school.Instead of doing homework, every spare minute I had was spent with a ball.In the end it paid off.But even now I still have to pinch myself when I run out and get to play each week in front of tens of thousands of people.However there is something that sets me apart from most of the other players in the Premier League.I am gay.Even writing that down in this letter is a big step for me.But only my family members and a select group of friends are aware of my sexuality. I don’t feel ready to share it with my team or my manager.That’s hard. I spend most of my le with these guys and when we step out on the pitch we are a team.But still, something inside me makes it impossible for me to be open with them about how I feel.I dearly hope one day soon I will be able to.I’ve known since I was about  that I was gay. How does it feel having to live like this Day-to-day, it can be an absolute nightmare.And it is affecting my mental health more and more.I feel trapped and my fear is that disclosing the truth about what I am will only make things worse.So, although my heart often tells me I need to do it my head always says the same thing: “Why risk it all ”I am lucky enough to earn a very good wage. I have a nice car, a wardrobe full of designer clothes and can afford to buy anything I want for my family and friends.But one thing I am missing is companionship.I am at an age where I would love to be in a relationship.But because of the job I do the level of trust in having a long-term partner has to be extremely high.So, at the moment, I avoid relationships at all.I dearly hope I will soon meet someone who I think I will be able to trust enough.The truth is I just don’t think football is ready yet for a player to come out.The game would need to make radical changes in order for me to feel able to make that step. The Professional Footballers Association say they are ready to help a player to come out.And they have said they will offer counselling and support to anyone who needs it.This is missing the point. If I need a counsellor I can go and book a session with one whenever I want. What those running the game need to do is educate fans, players, managers, agents, club owners — basically everyone involved in the game.If I was to make that step I’d want to know that I would be supported at each step of my journey. Right now, I don’t feel I would be.I wish I didn’t have to live my le in such a way.But the reality is there is still a huge amount of prejudice in football.There are countless times I’ve heard homophobic chants and comments from supporters directed at no one in particular.Strangely it doesn’t really bother me during the matches. I am too focused on playing.It’s when I get back on the plane or the coach and I have time to think that it gets to me.As things stand my plan is to carry on playing for as long as I feel able to and then come out when I have retired.It was great last month to see Thomas Beattie raise his hand and admit to being gay. But the fact he had to wait until retirement tells you all you need to know.Footballers are still too scared to make the step while they are playing.For the past year I have been getting support from the Justin Fashanu Foundation, not least to cope with the toll this is all having on my mental health.It is hard to put into words how much the Foundation has helped. It has made me feel supported and understood as well as giving me the confidence to be more open and honest with myself especially.Without that support I really don’t know where I’d be now.I know it might get to the point where I find it impossible to keep living a lie.If I do my plan is to retire early and come out. I might be throwing away years of a lucrative career. But you can’t put a price on your peace of mind.And I don’t want to live like this forever.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You are a clever girl, Sue.”It’s a little bit patronising, admittedly and he’d be hauled through every kangaroo court in the country for saying that out loud now.But I’ll take Jim’s innocent version of television before I take ’s joyless, humourless woke wasteland all day long, thanks very much. It’s a happier place.INCIDENTALLY, Loose Women, Janet Street- Porter: “If I was an animal I’d be a terrapin.”What’s technically known as horse-s***.MEANWHILE, on episode three of Celebrity Snoop Dogs, a pug called Colin is snfing around a weight-training room as Channel ’s Kevin McCloud builds to the big reveal.“More eye-catching, though, is that plaque behind the microphone. Could it belong to ­someone who’s good at making people laugh “It’s Russell Kane!” No, it couldn’t.HOW television works .Someone a BBC continuity announcer described as “the wonderful Maxine Peake” starred in last week’s Talking Heads, a fortnight after sharing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about George Floyd’s death, with The Independent.Miriam Margolyes s to the Beeb shortly, with her Almost Australian travelogue, despite telling Channel ’s Last Leg she wanted the Prime Minister to die of coronavirus.But actor Laurence Fox is unemployable and considered a public pariah, by the industry, because he told Question Time that Britain was “the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe”.One rule for one, quite another for Corbynistas.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Asteroid  Audrey is named after which actress ”Marina: “Kim Basinger.”Tenable, Warwick Davis: “Name the ten largest countries in South America.” Devon: “Hungary.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In  -year-old Judit Polgar became the youngest ­international grandmaster of which board game ”Helena: “Monopoly.”Ben Shephard: “Mayo is the Spanish word for which month of the year ”Rick: “March.”GOOD Morning Britain, Monday, Piers: “What about this  At my local Italian ­restaurant, on Saturday, after all this showing-each- other-more-kindness talk, there were  no-shows.”Then Piers turned up. Problem solved. So what about it HAVING failed to conquer Hollywood or overthrow international capitalism Russell Brand took on a slightly more manageable project, last week.A cameo in Neighbours where he literally bumped into Toadie, eating a muffin, at the Harold Bishop cafe.“You’re Russell Brand! What are you doing here in Erinsborough ”“Well, you know,” said Brand, “Get Him To The Greek, The Trews, socialism, Ed Miliband. It all went horribly wrong.“So it was either this or a Postcode Lottery advert, with Jeff Brazier.”Actually, he said no such thing.He made a funny, self-mocking speech about the irony of mobile phones being “emblems of interconnectivity, yet we’re more atomised, adrt and lost than ever before”, then went to order a coffee.And I’ve got no hesitation in saying, I think it’s his finest ever work.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has no place anywhere. It is often a breach of human rights. It is often illegal.So it is understandable that many of us are questioning why this is happening – and, by extension, what our role is in this.Has our desire for cheap and cheerful fashion created this sickening practice  Are we somehow to blame for insisting we will only pay as little as possible for everything Should we — as some smarmy “influencers” suggest — be boycotting anyone who sells cheap clothes The simple answer is: NoOf course, in an ideal world, we’d all be buying top quality, ethically sourced garments that last a letime.But that’s just not going to happen. Most people just can’t afford to. And we like to keep up with trends while at the same time paying the bills. There is nothing wrong with that.Our love of fashion keeps the economy going.Fashion is the UK’s largest creative industry. It provides jobs for almost as many people as the financial sector and is one of the most female-dominated industries in the world.Around , people work in the UK fashion industry and approximately  per cent of garment workers are women.Livelihoods are at stakewe decide to boycott fashion brands because of their bad practices.The answer is for fast fashion firms like Boohoo and Quiz to do the work and get their houses in order. This is on them.And big firms like Boohoo — a business worth £.billion — are not without means. They have the resources to make changes.They need to perform due diligence on who is making their clothes — they must forensically examine the whole supply chain, from contractors to sub-contractors and anyone  who has a hand in how this stuff comes to market.Decent wages must be the norm. They must be transparent and tell us, the consumer, what they know.This is not rocket science. It is already happening.The Fashion Transparency Index  ranks  of the biggest global fashion brands according to how much information they provide about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices and social and environmental impact.Retailers are scored on their transparency across five key areas: Policy and commitments, governance, traceability, supplier assessment and remediation and spotlight issues.HM, one of the largest fashion retailers in the world, is currently top of The Fashion Transparency Index.Stung by allegations that its clothes had been made by child labour in Myanmar — with some paid as little as p an hour — it last year built a new tracking system so consumers can find out where each garment is made.Marks  Spencer also scored highly. It introduced an ethical trading programme including audits of its supply chain in the Nineties.Eleven more brands in the Fashion Index revealed details of their processing facilities — where finishing, dyeing and laundering take place — in  compared to .And ten brands disclosed their raw material suppliers in , compared with just one in .Of course this isn’t just a fast fashion problem. It is industry-wide.What customers need from all brands is transparency, as this leads to accountability and ultimately change.Soyou do want to spend your hard-earned cash on fast fashion, only shop at places where you know they are doing their bit to ensure things are more ethically sourced.AS much as I love new clothes, fast fashion has had its day.Two brands have recently been at the centre of allegations that garments are being made or packed in dire working conditions in Leicester.Boohoo has paid a heavy price for these claims, with more than a billion pounds wiped off the value of its shares.Today, it suffered another big fall after a leading investor sold out on ethical grounds.And rival Quiz was sucked into the growing storm. It has suspended a supplier after claims that a factory in Leicester offered a worker just £ an hour to make its clothes.Quiz admitted that the situation, which it is investigating, is “unacceptable”.As online retailers specialising in casualwear, these companies were riding high after lockdown boosted sales. Following these allegations, the tide is turning against them.It comes after lockdown prompted many of us to reassess our lives, with the desire to be greener high on the agenda.A recent survey showed that more women were willing to make do and mend. That can’t be a bad thing.A common reason that clothes are sent to landfill is a missing button, which is simply appalling.Before buying a new dress or jacket, I now ask myself, ‘Am I going to wear this item for years ’Fashion is a global industry worth more than £trillion a year. It will clean itself up where necessary and adapt.Boohoo and Quiz have been swt to terminate relationships with rogue suppliers. Elsewhere, there is much talk of “respons-ible” and “sustainable” fashion.Don’t be surprisedthe fast fashion pack gives itself a long overdue makeover.

Where are my lines  Do I have any left The High Court heard today:Malcolm Connolly, Depps security guard, today denied there had been any assault on the train.But he admitted that he was about three or four doors down from the couple, saying he would never have known about the fightit had taken place in the early hours of the morning.He said that he would have noticed any injuries on Heard, adding: I looked after Amber. I afforded her the same protection and professionalism I gave to Johnny Depp.The security guard also recounted the alleged bust-up in Australia in March , saying he found Depp in emotional distress and panicking after his finger was severed.Mr Connolly, who has worked for Mr Depp and his family for about  years, said in a witness statement that when he and another security guard arrived at the property, the Hollywood star told him: Look at my finger. Shes cut my f***ing finger off. Shes smashed my hand with a vodka bottle.The security guard denied the claims that Depp was absolutely filthy and covered in blood and paint and dirt.He said he got to the property at about .pm after receiving an urgent call from the head of Mr Depps security team Jerry Judge, who has since died, who told him: Malcolm, get in the car, extract the boss from the situation.Mr Connolly said: I could hear the ruckus inside. I opened the door, which wasnt locked, and saw Johnny in the foyer area of the house.He and Amber were screaming at each other. She was wearing a sort of green silk night thing, you might call it a slip.I shouted at Johnny words to the effect of Come with me, you are coming with me.I then took his arm trying to move him out, but he broke away. I said again words to the effect of Johnny, come with me. It wasnt easy but I did get him outside.He claimed he had previously seen Heard throw a fork and a lighter at Depp previously, saying: I knew that we needed to get out of there as soon as possible.The security guard said the team knew the true cause of Mr Depps injury would create extremely bad publicity and that Mr Judge suggested they should say at hospital that the actor had injured his finger while slicing onions.It comes after Depp claimed in his witness statement that Heard had an agenda to progress her own career and or to benefit financially.Sasha Wass QC, representing The Suns publisher News Group Newspapers, referred to a text sent by Mr Depp shortly after the couple split which said Heard was gold-digging, low-leveldime-a-dozen, adding: Gold-digging is top of the list.Tara Roberts, estate manager at Depp’s island in the Bahamas, said she witnessed the blazing row while they were visiting in December .She also denied Depp was abusive, saying Ms Heard was the violent one and known to be a “thrower”.Speaking about the row, she said: “While I could not hear what caused the fight, Amber repeatedly berated him with increasing ferocity.“She was insulting him, calling him names, and in the middle of this onslaught I heard her say specically “your career is over”, “no one is going to hire you”, “you’re washed up, fat, you will die a lonely man”, and also screaming things that were incomprehensible.She went on: “I saw Amber lunge at Johnny, clawing, tugging and aggressively pulling him.“He continued to stand there yelling at her to stop and leave him alone. When he stepped back to leave, her onslaught would start again.“During this entire incident, I never saw Johnny hit Amber, or push her back, nor did he physically react to the attacks.“I walked him to the cafe and he laid on the couch and that is when I saw that he had a red, swelling gash on the bridge of his nose.“Johnny told me Amber had thrown a quart-sized can of lacquer thinner into his face, causing the gash.”Ms Roberts said she never saw Johnny be violent or aggressive to Ms Heard or anyone .She said Ms Heard changed him from “outgoing, friendly and social” to “withdrawn”.The explosive claims come on the sixth day of what is expected to be a three week libel trial.Heard wore her customary red scarf with a black suit as she arrived at court today with girlfriend Bianca Butti while Depp was pictured in a blue suit with a black face covering.

The High Court today was told how Heard appeared on the Late Late Show with James Corden on December , , the night after the alleged incident.Heard is then said to have exclaimed Can you believe I just did that show with two black eyes  after the show. But Hollywood stylist Samantha McMillen today took the stand in the libel case, claiming she had not seen the actress with any visible marks on her face or body.In a witness statement to the court, she said: I saw her throughout the day, in good light, at close range, wearing no makeup.Throughout the day, I could see clearly that Amber did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her body.After the show, Ms Heard said to me, ‘Can you believe I just did that show with two black eyes ’ But she did not have any black eyes, and had been visibly uninjured throughout the day and at that moment.I later learned that Ms Heard had accused Johnny Depp of violently abusing her the previous night.The High Court heard today:She said she had been confused by Heards comments about the bruises, saying: I didnt see the black eyes, but also I dont want to, you know, raise any sort of - I just wanted to go home.Ms McMillen said he later overheard Ms Heard telling a pal: “Make sure to get those pictures on to my computer” - but she didn’t know what pictures she was referring to.Sasha Wass QC, representing News Group Newspapers, then referred to a message sent by Heard in December , which read: Johnny did a number on me tonight. The barrister asked: Did Ms Heard ever say to you that Johnny did a number on her  Ms McMillen said: She never said anything about that to me.And the stylist admitted she was loyal to Depp, saying: I’m loyal because he is kind and loyal back, but not for any other reason than that.Ms McMillen was then asked about an email sent by Ms Heard to her publicist, Jodi Gottlieb, in the early hours of December  which said: Im really bruised or might have a black eye or two tomorrow … I might not be fit for tomorrow but I wont know how bad the bruise is until the morning.And she said she couldnt think of why she would have sent the emailshe didnt have the injuries.The stylist also said she didnt remember any conversation with Heards make-up artist, Melanie Inglessis, that she was going to put a really bright red lipstick on Ms Heard to try and cover the mark on her lip.Depp has claimed Ms Heard faked the injuries as part of an “insurance dossier” against him.Heard has claimed Depp attacked her in a prolonged and violent assault the night before.The assault allegedly happened on the night of December ,  at the penthouse shared by the couple.Depp allegedly threw a decanter at Heard, slapped her face and dragged her through the apartment by the hair.He was said to have pulled “large chunks of hair and scalp” out of Ms Heard’s head as he pulled her up the stairs while threatening to kill her.As Heard tried to escape the violence, Depp allegedly hit her in the back of the head and knocked her to the floor. As she staggered to her feet, it was claimed, Depp screamed: “Oh, you think you’re a f***ing tough guy ” before headbutting her in her face.He then allegedly threw her on to the bed and knelt on her back while repeatedly punching her in her head, screaming: “I f***ing hate you” over and over again.Heard suffered severe headaches and other pains for at least a week after the attack, it was claimed.Later, Depp allegedly wrote a message on the kitchen countertop in gold pen that read: “Why be a fraud  All is such bulls***.”Depp told the court: “I was not violent toward Ms Heard in any way. In fact, on this date, Ms Heard violently attacked me, as she had done many times before, leaving me with a number of scratches and swelling around my face.Ms Heard has fabricated these allegations, including ly claiming that the blond hair on the floor was her hair that had been pulled out by me.I remember this period as one in which Ms Heard was continually trying to argue with me and at times would physically assault me.If Ms Heard had actually been assaulted in the way she described, she would have had very severe and visible injuries. There is no evidence whatsoever of this having been the case.The actor’s case against NGN and executive editor Dan Wootton came after an article was published in  with the headline “Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be ‘genuinely happy’ casting we beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film ”.NGN is defending the article as true and says Mr Depp was “controlling and verbally and physically abusive towards Heard, particularly when he was under the influence of alcohol and or drugs” between early  and May , when the couple split.The pair met in  and began living together in  before marrying in Los Angeles in February .If you are affected by domestic abuse, please call the National Domestic Abuse Helpline on   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have never and will never compromise that security in pursuit of economic prosperity.MPs warned the action could lead to retaliation from China.Sources said security services were ready for any cyber attacks in response to todays decision, but stressed the UK was always ready for state sponsored cyber attacks of any kind.Mr Dowden added: This government will not be cowed by the comments of any other country and indeed this decision has been made in the national security interests of this nation.The Culture Secretary also revealed the new Telecoms Security bill would be coming in the Autumn, but refused to say exactly when.It comes after a growing revolt from Mr Johnsons own MPs over the Chinese company’s technology.Speaking in the chamber, Tory MP Anthony Mangnall called for the  date to be brought forward, and accused Huawei of using slave labour.He said: If the Government is going to be clear-eyed about China, it must also be clear-eyed about the human rights violations that are reportedly being undertaken by Huawei and their use of slave labour.It is not acceptable for a global Britain to be involved in a company that is perpetually using slave labour in their supply chain.”Iain Duncan Smith became the most senior Tory to complain that the seven-year removal is too long.He said: Lets bring it forward to five, and make sure it happens quickly.In a letter to Mr Johnson, ten Tory MPs had bashed the “unreasonable delay”. They said: “We do not believe it is possible for the UK to have both secure networks and a role for Huawei within them. “It remains the case that, under China’s national intelligence law, Huawei is obliged to co-operate with Chinese intelligence and to deny that it does so. The nature of Chinese law is such that Huawei is — to all intents and purposes — a state-owned enterprise.In the last month alone, the world has been confronted with shocking new evidence of systematic human rights abuses by the Chinese Communist Party. These include a birth suppression programme directed against Uighur Muslims by the authorities.“Knowing how lightly China takes the assurances it has given, many colleagues are even more uncomfortable about a role for Huawei in our networks.The MPs include former party leader IDS, ex-cabinet minister David Davis and Bob Seely.Mr Seely had also warned that the government would face further furythe deadline was pushed back until the end of the decade.A Whitehall official explained today that it was not as simple as just taking off a piece of equipment.They said: It is not just ripping out an aerial, you are dismantling a highly intelligent piece of equipment.The Government announced in January that Huwaei would be limited to the core of the G network and just  per cent market share of the other parts.This morning Lord Browne of Madingley stepped down early as the UK chairman of Huawei Technologies ahead of the ban.Yesterday BT chief Philip Jansen warned of possible “outages”they are ordered to remove all Huawei products which help run G and G networks over security risks.He said: “I think that’s impossible to do in under ten years.Huawei has always denied that it poses any security risk and insists that it is a private company free from Chinese state control.Ed Brewster, a spokesperson for Huawei UK, said: This disappointing decision is bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone.“It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital ide. Instead of ‘levelling up’ the government is levelling down and we urge them to reconsider. We remain confident that the new US restrictions would not have affected the resilience or security of the products we supply to the UK.“Regrettably our future in the UK has become politicized, this is about US trade policy and not security.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So, the timing is very, very important. If we can stop it early, we can save lives.The former specialist in virology said she feared she would be killed for speaking out in China and chose to escape to the United States, where she is currently hiding at an undisclosed location.Yan is now determined to expose the Chinese government for allegedly knowing about the novel coronavirus before publicly acknowledging the outbreak.She told Fox News: “The reason I came to the U.S. is because I deliver the message of the truth of Covid.If I tell it in Hong Kong, the moment I start to tell it I will be disappeared and killed.According to Yan, the Chinese Communist Party and senior university staff suppressed evidence that coronavirus could be transmitted between humans as early as last December. Yan, who grew up in mainland China, said she was among the first scientists asked to investigate a small number of cases in Wuhan.She claims her supervisor first asked her to conduct a secret investigation into a new SARS-like virus in Wuhan on December  of last year.Yan said: “The China government refused to get overseas experts, even including ones in Hong Kong, to do research in China.”So I turned to my friends to get more information.She said she then spoke to a number of contacts, including one who worked at Chinas Center for Disease Control and Prevention.She said the friend told her of an unknown virus that had emerged in Wuhan and that family cluster cases, an indicator of human-to-human transmission, had been observed.She was also told that the number of cases was thought to be rising exponentially.She claims that, when she took her findings to her superior, she was told to keep silent and be careful.He warned me..., Dont touch the red line, Dr Li said, referring to the unspoken limits placed by Beijing on such investigations.We will get in trouble and well be disappeared. The scientist says it was information that she believes could have saved lives.Yan claimed the Chinese government refused to let overseas experts, including those from Hong Kong, conduct research in China.Yan explained: “I have to hide because I know how they treat whistleblowers, and as a whistleblower here I want to tell the truth of Covid- and the origin of the SARS- Covid virus.”Doctors have reported being detained after speaking out on social media about what they were witnessing, while journalists have recounted being harassed and having their equipment confiscated after trying to report on the issue.Ill-fated whistle blower Dr Li Wenliang tried to warn the world about the killer virus but was sent a chilling letter by the police before he died.Wenliang was told by copshe refused to repent he would be punished not long before he was killed by the deadly virus.Yan told Hemmer that she has records of communications with others in China, and underlined that she is very much in fear for her le.She said: “I know how they treat whistleblowers.”[They want] To keep people silentthey want to reveal the truth, not only about COVID-, but also for the other things happening in China.”I am waiting to tell all the things I know, provide all the evidence to the US Government.”She went on: “And I want them to understand, and I also want the U.S. people to understand how terrible this is. It is not what you have seen. This is something very dferent.“We have to chase the true evidence and get the real evidence because this is a key part to stop this pandemic. We dont have much time.A bombshell spy dossier claimed China lied to the world about coronavirus by covering up the outbreak.A -page document, obtained by Australias The Saturday , laid the foundation for a case being created against China for its handling of the deadly disease.The dossier, from the Five Eyes intelligence agencies of the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, stated that Chinas secrecy surrounding the virus led to an assault on international transparency.It said: Despite evidence of human-human transmission from early December, PRC authorities deny it until January .”The World Health Organisation does the same.

He told the House of Commons: There is also evidence that face coverings increase confidence in people to shop.Face coverings can make shoppers feel even more confident about ing to the high street.They have a part to play in helping the nation recover and protecting shop workers, he added.Mr Hancock said that those shops can call the policepeople without an exemption from wearing a face covering refuse to comply.Kids under  and those with disabilities will be exempt.And he accused Labour of making the issue a party political football.Deaths among shop assistants % higher for men and % higher for women than general population and the policy will help protect those more at risk because of their jobs, Mr Hancock said. When askedthe mandatory mask rule would be extended to offices, George Eustice told BBC Radio : At the moment we take one step at a time and weve taken the view in this next step that we should make it mandatory in retail environments.When it comes to workplace environments, because people are in the same company throughout the day, there are not lots of people coming through the venue as you have in a retail environment. The risk of transmission is therefore lower. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has been calling for mandatory face masks for months, slammed the PM for failing to make people feel safer.He told Good Morning Britain: I wish it had been brought in today rather than next Friday. This will help all of us be safer and could prevent a second wave that could have led to a second lockdown, which none of us wants. What has been announced:But Mr Eustice said the delay in the change was to give businesses time to prepare - despite guidance over masks being issued months ago. He said: Two things have been going on - evidence and understanding has been evolving, WHO changed its guidance back in June. We then loosened the lockdown and allowed more venues to open.We need to consider the mix of measures we have in place and control the virus. Some Conservative Party members have cut up their membership in protest of the move to make masks mandatory - claiming it goes against the partys libertarian values. The hashtag #NoMasks and the word muzzles were both trending on Twitter this morning. Studies have shown wearing masks has a signicant effect on stopping people who are infected from infecting others and spreading the virus - sometimes without symptoms.And other European countries such as Italy made face masks compulsory in all indoor spaces as they allowed shops and restaurants to reopen. Mr Eustice said people wont have to wear face masks to restaurants or bars - but would have to wear them at hairdressers. The mixed messages over where to wear masks adds to the confusion which started last Friday, when Boris Johnson said he was looking at tightening up the rules to make sure that more people wear them. But only days later, Michael Gove told BBCs Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: I dont think mandatory, no, but I would encourage people to wear face masks where they are inside and mixing with others, and the ventilation isnt as good.  At the moment its only mandatory to wear a mask on public transport - like trains, planes, buses or trams.Only a handful of fines have been dished out to people for not wearing them.Police are also outraged - claiming they wont be able to shoulder the responsibility to ensure people where masks, branding the policy absurd. politan Police Federation chairman Ken Marsh told Radio : Shopkeepers need to step up to the plate and take some responsibility. They can quite easily put signs up on their doors No mask on, no entry, this is private property.The second point is it will be nigh-on impossible for enforcement because you wont have a police officer on every shop door because there isnt enough of us.If a shopkeeper calls the police because someone hasnt got a mask on, they havent got the power to detain them so that person can just walk away.Well be driving around and around London looking for people who arent wearing masks, its absolutely absurd.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are working closely with them to fully understand the situation. Shoppers and staff in the stores visited by the farm workers are not at any increased risk of Covid-. Our environmental health teams have been assisting businesses to follow the correct Covid- health and safety guidance. This is to ensure shoppers can visit stores with confidence. If you are washing your hands regularly, keeping your distance and using face coverings where necessary, you protect yourself and others.”It comes after four of the vegetable pickers - allegedly including three infected with the killer bug -fled the farm, as revealed by The Sun yesterday.Two left on Saturday - one of whom was positive - and two more infected with the virus fled today.It is believed they legged it across the fields, with Herefordshire County Council confirming several workers had fled the farm - but claimed three not four workers had absconded - and insisted only one of them had tested positive for coronavirus.And now panic has set in for the disproportionate amount of elderly people who live close to the farm, home to one of the largest outbreak of its kind in the UK since the pandemic began.Of the , people living in the villages within a three-miles radius of the farm, two thirds of them are aged  or older.One, a -year-old retired man, said: “We’re terried.

We spent four months in lockdown and just as it ends, we’ve found ourselves going back into voluntary lockdown.”At the farm, owned by vegetable tycoons Andrew and Caroline Green, telecommunications specialists spent the day fitting boosters to improve broadband access for the locked-down workers so they can keep in contact with the outside world.According to MP Mr Wiggin, testing was conducted after one worker fell ill on July .The first case was allegedly recorded by farm owners AS Green and Co on Wednesday last week.Five more tested positively the next day and by the weekend, when the farm was locked down,  cases had tested positive. Today the figure is .Authorities previously raised concern workers made regular trips to a Morrisons store in nearby Malvern.Herefordshire Council is arranging food and essential supplies for residents on the site.A spokesperson for Iceland said: Our store colleagues in Worcester have no recollection of this group visiting the store.

South China Sea is fully within grasp of the #PLA any US #aircraftcarrier movement in the region is at the pleasure of PLA,” a tweet from The Global Times said.The US Navy’s chief of information replied: “And yet, there they are. Two @USNavy aircraft carriers operating in the international waters of the South China Sea. #USSNimitz  #USSRonaldReagan are not intimidated.”The dispute centres around legal claims to ocean areas and two island chains, the Paracels and the Spratlys, which are thought to be abundant in natural resources.Every year some £. trillion of trade passes through the dispute area and the United States has been joined by Australia, the UK and France in sailing warships through it to assert freedom of navigationChina has engaged in a massive military build-up in the area, creating a network of articial islands, which it uses to assert its territorial claim.It claims that these are part of its national coastline but the United States and the Philippines say that doesnt apply to articial islands.Chinas claim to a  mile territorial limit around the islands is not internationally recognised.Warships from the United States and China have been engaged in tense stand-offs which have threatened to escalate into conflict in the disputed seas.In January , China reacted with fury after the US sent a missile destroyer through the disputed waters in a direct challenge to Beijing.China responded by scrambling warships and aircraft to intercept the ship, which sailed within a dozen miles of the increasingly-militarised Paracel Island chain.And in the Chinese military newspaper the PLA Daily, Colonel Zhang Junshe warned the US to back down.He said: The US is not a country in the region and it is doing large-scale exercises in the South China Sea, far away from its homeland, yet at the same time it is unreasonably accusing China of doing normal military exercises at its doorstep.The double-standard remarks from the US cannot disguise its real motives, which is to push militarization and destabilize peace in the South China Sea.He accused the US of having a Cold War attitude as relations between the two superpowers freeze over - with rows also raging over the coronavirus pandemic.The US military drill is said to have been long planned and not considered a direct response to recent actions from China.Speaking of the exercise,  Rear Admiral George M. Wikoff said: The purpose is to show an unambiguous signal to our partners and allies that we are committed to regional security and stability.Wikoff, commander of the strike group led by the Ronald Reagan, insisted the exercises were not a response to those being conducted by China.The Pentagon has criticised the Beijing’s drills as counter-productive to efforts at easing tensions and maintaining stability.The United States accuses China of trying to intimidate Asian neighbours who might want to use the seas extensive oil and gas reserves.Beijing claims it owns most of the disputed patch of ocean but other nations claim their own chunks under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.The convention states that nations’ claims to the waters around them must be measured from land.To thwart this, Beijing has been building man-made islands on top of coral reefs in the middle of the sea and packing them with weapons as they attempt to region into a fortress.Mr Pompeo has previously accused China of using the Covid- pandemic to assert control of the region and flex its military muscles.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And he said the purchase of Huawei G kit would be banned by the end of the year. The move was announced in parliament by culture minister Oliver Dowden, who said the imposition of new sanctions by the United States signicantly changed the assessment of Britainaposs National Cyber Security Centre, who could not guarantee the security of future Huawei G equipment. But what does all this mean  Will Huawei phones stop working  And are they safe to use  Hereaposs everything you need to know. What has changed  In May, the US issued a sanction blocking US software and technology firms from working with Huawei. It also blocks Huawei chips from being manufactured using US technology - or even within a factory that uses US technology. That means the firm needs to make major changes to how it designs and builds its hardware - which includes network equipment.What does that mean for the UK  In January, the National Cyber Security Centre decided it was OK for Huawei to have a limited role in the rollout of new G networks. But theyaposve changed their mind because of the new sanction - and because they can no longer work with US technology, they no longer consider that the UK will be able to manage the security risks of using Huawei technology. What does this mean for Huawei phones and laptops   Nothing, really. The ban only applies to network infrastructure - the equipment that runs internet and phone signals. Huawei phones, tablets and laptops will still be on sale to the public as they were before. Is it safe to buy Huawei devices  Will they still work  Huawei devices will continue to work as they do currently.The big change as a result of US sanctions was that Google apps and the Google Play store are no longer available to use on new Huawei phones.If theyaposre already on your device, they wonapost disappear. But beyond basic security updates, they also wonapost receive any new versions of Googleaposs Android operating system. As far as overall safety is concerned, the decision today - and the cyber security advice - doesnapost apply to consumer goods, only to infrastructure. Officials stress consumer devices present a minimal security risk.What is G  G is the latest - and fastest - type of mobile internet connection. Itaposs around  times faster than G - and more stable as well. The government hopes it can be used to increase mobile internet capacity across the UK, allowing more people to get online without the network slowing down. And the plan is that over time more people will use mobile internet instead of wired connections to their homes - which will allow faster speeds for people in remote areas.

Just hours after Michael Gove told people to use common sense, Health Secretary Matt Hancock is expected to announce the move today in the Commons. Police will be expected to enforce the law - and there will be £ fines for those who refuse. It comes more than two months after the government first recommended wearing a face covering in indoor spaces to prevent passing Covid- to others. But amid mixed messaging, many people are still not wearing them - so Boris Johnson has decided to act. Hereaposs what the new rules will mean and how they will affect you. Where do I need to wear a face covering  Since May , government guidance in England has advised the public to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces, where they may come into contact with people they wouldn’t usually meet. These can include shops and public transport. The use of face coverings became mandatory on public transport in England from June . But until now, the government has refused calls to make them compulsory in shops. Barely  hours ago, Cabinet minister Michael Give urged people to use common sense instead. What is changing  From Friday  July, face coverings will become mandatory in England in shops and supermarkets. This will be written into law and there will be £ fines for those who refuse to wear a mask. Do face coverings actually work   Scientic evidence suggests face coverings help prevent you from passing coronavirus on to other peopleyou are sick. It does not protect you from breathing in the virus unless it is a full-blown piece of medical PPE - something which is not recommended. If you have symptoms, you should be self-isolating at home, but many people get Covid- without symptoms and can spread it rapidly. One SAGE member suggested the virus can linger potent in the air for an hour after being breathed out in an indoor, badly-ventilated space. The UK government initially feared the added risk of handling and fiddling with a face mask could outweigh the benefits. But itaposs performed a U-turn. Face coverings are not, however, a substitute for social distancing - you should do both.  Yes. As with public transport, children under  will not have to wear a face covering. Those who canapost affix a face covering without suffering severe distress, or who have dficulty using it due to a physical or mental disability, are also exempt. It is thought other exemptions will follow the list already used on public transport. These exceptions include anyone who is being relied on by a deaf person for lipreading police or public transport staff emergency responders or people while they are taking medication. Sources suggest there will also be some types of shop that are exempt from the blanket policy. Will it be the law, or just aposguidanceapos  It will be the law. Regulations will be made under the Public HealthAct  - the same law used as the basis for many lockdown restrictions.  The law will define a face covering. This is not a surgical mask and can be a piece of cloth. It must however cover your nose and mouth. The government has a guide to making your own, or they can be bought relatively cheaply from many shops or online. How much can I be fined  Those caught by police contravening the law will be fined £, reducing to £paid within  days. Unlike previous lockdown laws, this £ fine will not double on each repeat offence. It remains fixed at £ each time. Can I be arrestedI donapost agree  "},{"url":null,"title":"tory mp moans its monstrous","story":"NewsTory MP moans its monstrous to make him wear a face mask at the shopsSir Desmond Swayne - who previously covered his face with blackface - hit out at the policy designed to protect other people around him in the supermarketShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video tory-desmond-swayne-calls-new-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics tory-mp-moans-its-monstrous-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Desmond Swayne hit out despite masks being designed to protect other people, and more than , people dying with coronavirus in the UK - saying it would put him off going to the shops. The -year-old complained he and his constituents in New Forest West were outraged and reluctant and questioned how police would enforce the law. Face coverings will be made mandatory in shops and supermarkets in England from July  - with exceptions for under-s or certain disabled people. Confirming the move to Parliament, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: Let us all do our utmost to keep this virus cornered and enjoy summer safely.But Sir Desmond - who previously covered his face with black paint, said it was fun and refused to apologise - griped: Nothing would make me less likely to go shopping than the thought of having to mask up.Was this consultation with the police force and particularly the chief constable of Hampshire  For it is she that will have to enforce this monstrous imposition against myself and a number of outraged and reluctant constituents. Sir Desmond echoed a string of Tory activists who even cut up their Conservative Party membership cards in protest.The hashtag #NoMasks and the word muzzles were both trending on Twitter on Tuesday morning. Activists said the order - which carries a maximum fine from police of £ for non-compliance - is incompatible with their libertarian values. Others claimed there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the measure has meaningful health benefits, despite the governmentaposs scientic advisors saying wearing a mask can protect others in enclosed spaces. Dominey Jenner, , a stay-at-home mother and former teacher from Wimbledon, south-west London, told the PA news agency that she had been quite sceptical about the lockdown but said the face mask rules are the final straw. If you look at the statistics regarding the cases and the death rate, which is plummeting... why now you would bring in mandatory face masks  she said.The other strand for me is the libertarian strand. I think people should be trusted, I think we should be given a choice. Iaposm really angry at how the Government has invoked fear in its population to control people - I think that is the wrong way to manage a population and to govern.A recent modelling study from the Universities of Cambridge and Greenwich found that the widespread use of face masks keeps the coronavirus reproduction number below ..Researchers found that even homemade masks with limited effectiveness can dramatically reduce transmission ratesworn by enough people, regardless of whether they show symptoms.  Yet Alistair Haimes, owner of a private investment company who joined the Tories a few months ago, said he is now leaving the party. They think that people will be more confident to go back to shops and officesthey wear them thanthey donapost, he said. I think people should be free to wear them. I just object to being told what to do. He added: People are trying to see the iding lines where they arenapost. People are seeing it as Brexiteer Tories who are against masks.I voted for Tony Blair.

I glanced at it and saw it was an image, and when I clicked on to it, I saw it was a selfie of him naked, embracing another nude man, who I didn’t recognise. I was incredibly shocked, but I haven’t found the courage to ask him about it. I wasn’t snooping – the image just popped up when I happened to be there, but I’m worried about what he’ll tell me and what it will mean for us. We’re both in our s and have been married for three years. What do I do Coleen saysI think you know what you have to do, you must say something. You can’t un-see this photo, so all you can do now is confront it head on.

June Harvey was sorting through clothes in her terrace house in Bow, London, when the crane collapsed on Wednesday afternoon and sounded “like a bomb going off”. She had been standing just metres away from her niece Jacqueline Atkinson, , who miraculously escaped with cuts and bruises. It took a team of specialist firefighters hours to try and recover Juneaposs body. At least four other people were injured in the disaster, including a construction worker who remained fighting for le in hospital on Friday. Juneaposs grief-stricken family has now released pictures of the retired dressmaker and bingo caller and paid a heartrending tribute as they try to come to terms with the tragedy. Niece Jacqueline said: “June was my Aunt and she lived with me and my son Sam at the house. She was loyal and caring a true EastEnder. She was born in Poplar and had lived there all her le, working as a sewing machinist but had moved in with me and Sam last year, so we could help look after her. She was a wonderful woman, and a talented seamstress who was totally dedicated to her family. We are beyond devastated by what has happened.” She continued: “June loved gardening and spent much of her younger le outdoors in the garden and had a huge knowledge of plants and flowers. She also loved bingo and used to go almost every night. She was a bingo caller for many years at a local hall. Recalling the moment the crane came crashing down, Jacqueline said: “I was upstairs in the same room as June when the crane hit.  My son managed to help me escape by pushing a ladder up to the bedroom window and helping me climb down. I couldn’t believe it when I saw the crane had smashed into the house leaving it like a pile of rubble. There was dust everyone and Sam and I were both taken to hospital but sadly June didn’t make it. “I’m still in shock. The whole incident was absolutely terrying, and I can’t believe Sam and I made it out alive and June tragically didn’t. We are still numb and just ask for some peace now to grieve.”  Sam managed to get their dog, Teddy, out of the family home and then helped neighbours heroically rescue his mum from a first-floor window. But they were unable to find June, who had moved to the house in Compton Close just over a year ago so her niece and great nephew could help look after her. Sam, a chef in Canary Wharf, said: We are still very much in shock and mum still can’t talk about what has happened. It’s a miracle she survived but it is going to take a long time for us all to get over this.  We need answers about how this happened. We have lost everything and now we have a funeral to arrange and respectfully ask that we are given space to grieve.” The family have launched a GoFundMe page to cover expenses for June’s funeral where people can donate or leave messages of condolences for the family.

Oldest son Stanley, , has Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome– a condition which leads to an abnormal increase in his heart rate - and has a heart monitor in his chest.  And his younger brother Nathan, , has Neuro Development Delay and autism.Jenner, who relies on Universal Credit, says sheaposs been unable to afford basics - and itaposs taken a horrying toll on her sons.She told : I cry in the shower through guilt, because thereaposs only so much I can do. Itaposs really hard. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror  Describing the impact the crisis has had on her sons, she said: Itaposs hit them really hard. My oldest son said: aposI just want to jump out of the windowapos. Itaposs put me on edge, just the thought he would actually do it. Skyrocketing cost of living Jenner said the cost of living through lockdown has skyrocketed since March, and she fears le will be even tougher as the economy struggles to pick up again. Before the lockdown I had to live off food banks, she said. Itaposs a lot of pressure on parents, and I know Iaposm no worse off than a lot of people.  Unable to leave her home for three months because Nathan was shielding, Jenner has been receiving free meals from his school, and support from charity Action for Children. She said that by the time her Universal Credit allowance is paid, she is left with just over £ a month to spend on food and clothes for herself and her two sons. The cost of living since lockdown has been disgusting, she said. My youngest son wanted a bubble machine, it would normally be £ in the supermarket, but it was £ online. She has been reliant on Universal Credit since November, when she quit her job because Stanley needed her to be around more.Jenner is one of hundreds of parents across the UK who has applied for support from Action for Childrenaposs Emergency Coronavirus Appeal Fund.I donapost know what Iaposd have done without it, she said. Find out how bad child poverty is in your community by entering your postcode here: Parents skipping meals to feed kids Imran Hussain, the charityaposs director of policy and campaigns, toldthat there has been an unprecedented demand for help since the start of the crisis. The fund was launched to support families who were on the brink. He said: On one of the forms that Iaposve seen, the mum said aposmy child is always asking me why canapost mummy eat with me apos  Parents are doing everything they can to shield their children, and skipping meals is a pretty common coping mechanism. He said that with the governmentaposs furlough scheme set to be wound up, the effect on children will be devastating. This generation of children have grown up in the shadow of austerity, and now theyaposre having their childhoods and le chances uprooted by coronavirus. The governmentaposs response has got to match the challenge. Prior to the coronavirus crisis, the Daily Mirror was calling on Boris Johnson to hike child benefit by £ a week to end the scourge of child poverty. Without action the number of kids in poverty in the UK was set to rise from .million to .million in the next two years. Our Give Me Five campaign wanted an immediate increase in child benefit - a move that would lt , children out of destitution. Our campaign was backed by charities, politicians and union leaders. However, as the global pandemic sparks a fresh recession - which the International Monetary Fund warns could be the worst since the Great Depression in the  - charities say more needs to be done. Action for Children is now calling on the Government to increase child benefit further, by £, to recognise the ever-worsening situation plunging children in poverty. Meanwhile the Joseph Rowntree Foundation is calling for a just emergency intervention, targeted to mitigate the immediate strain on low-income families. The charity says an increase of at least £ per child per week to the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credits would go a long way to covering the increased costs posed by the current and potential subsequent lockdowns. Crisis follows decade of deep cuts New research by the Institute of Fiscal Studieshas found that the pandemic happened at a time when families were already more than £, worse off than they would have been without Tory benefit cuts. A report found that average income before housing costs has grown at a lower rate than at any time since the s. Changes to the benefits system under the Tories have seen families suffer, with entitlements falling by at least %.  The report said: Average benefit entitlement among workless households is % lower in − than it would have been without any policy changes since , and among workless households with children it is % lower. This means that out-of-work households are entitled to £, less than they would have been without cuts made since . Helen Barnard, Acting Director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: Coronavirus has delivered a major shock for the UK economy but it has also exposed problems which families in poverty have been grappling with for much longer. Finding a lasting solution has taken on a new urgency as the crisis has shown how close many of us are to being swept into poverty when circumstances change. As the economy recovers from the initial effects of the pandemic, we must make sure that what follows offers everyone the opportunity to get a good job which allows them to improve their living standards. More than  million children in poverty A study released last month reveals that parts of the north and the Midlands have endured the steepest rises in the number of children living below the breadline in the past five years. Research by Loughborough University sheds light on the shameful crisis, with . million children estimated to be in poverty across the UK. The horrying data found the poverty rate has risen fastest in the North East, and where it now affects nearly a quarter of children.  Glasgow, Newcastle, Oldham, Bolton, Birmingham and Leeds are among the towns and cities that have seen the steepest rises. Since  the number of children living in poverty in Britain has risen by , before housing costs are taken into account - meaning one in six children, or %, live in affected homes. Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions reveal that . million children were living in poverty in Great Britain in March last year.And the picture is even more bleak after housing costs are taken into account, with the figure rising to . million in the UK under the Tories - , more than a decade ago.North East - up to .% from .% - a .% rise  West Midlands - up to .% from .% - a .% rise  North West - up to % from .% - a .% rise  Yorkshire and Humberside - up to .% from .% - a .% rise  Scotland - up to .% from .% - a .% increase  London - up to .% from .% - a .% increase  South East - up to .% from .% - a .% increase  East of England - up to .% from .% - a .% increase  East Midlands - stayed the same, at .%  Wales - down to .% from .% - a .% decrease  South West - down to .% from % - a .% decrease"},{"url":null,"title":"inside radfords 10 bedroom home","story":"NewsInside the Radfords -bedroom home following a major lockdown transformationSue and Noel Radford have managed to squeeze  kids into a -bed former care home in Morecambe, Lancashire, which has its own bar, play area and outdoor cinemaShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsThe Radfords have been spending a lot of time together during lockdown \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The latest figures for Leicester show a seven-day rate of  cases per , people, compared to . for Leicestershire as a whole, . in Derby and . in Nottingham. Jonathan Van-Tam, The Deputy Chief Medical Office for England, said a lockdown exit plan for Leicester depends on when public health professionals decide that the infection rates are consistently and obviously falling. Mr Van-Tam told the BBC that the latest data released on Saturday showed the city is really quite an outlier compared with anywhere  in the country. He said: The situation has improved but it needs to go further. With any of these things, usually the way that one approaches them from a public health perspective is to take a phased approach. Normally you donapost just go from having the brakes on heavily to just taking the brakes off completely. He added that while it would not be his decision to end the lockdown it canapost be rushed.  Leicester became the first city in the country to have full restrictions reintroduced on June  following a spike in coronavirus infections. Since the shocking reports exposing sweat shops churning out cheap clothes for popular brands like Boohoo in Leicester claim it has contributed to the coronavirus spike.

Darren Palmer-George said heaposs noticed changes in his three daughters since the start of lockdown, and is terried about the devastating long-term impact it could have. Wheelchair user Darren said he and we Kelly, who has multiple sclerosis, were cut off from vital services in the darkest days of the pandemic - and were unable to properly grieve the death of Kellyaposs dad in March. Darren, , toldheaposs noticed drastic changes in daughters Keira, , Connie, nine, and seven-year-old Pippa - saying that at times it has been toxic. It comes as devastating research found a third of parents believe their children are now isolated and lonely - with some youngsters developing eating disorders during the uncertainty. Darren, who has battled depression since a  accident left him with irreparable damage to his back, told : I hate to think of the damage this is doing. There definitely has to be counselling for children when they go back to school. At the start of this year they were happy-go-lucky, then all of a sudden this happens and bang, the whole world has changed for them. The dad, from Dereham in Norfolk, said Kiera has been getting permanently upset and angry, locking herself in her room.  And he said youngest daughter Pippa now hates being on her own. Itaposs been horric, he said. Weaposve had absolutely no help at all, weaposve been trying to run a family and itaposs been so hard. He said Kelly has struggled following her dadaposs death from a heart attack, and lockdown restrictions meant the family were not able to grieve together. I had to wait in the car while my we was at the crematorium because it was immediate family only, he said. It was horrendous.  His three daughters were only able to say goodbye to their grandfather watching video of the service, unable to hug members of their extended family. Darren said both he and Kelly have used mental health services before the pandemic - but said they were left with no support at the height of the crisis. Darren said: My we has been suffering badly, weaposve had nothing. There isnapost anyone you can talk to straight away. Even before the lockdown, Darren said there were huge shortcomings with mental health support, which he fears will be made worse by the pandemic. He used to attend a dadaposs group at his local Action for Children centre - but that closed last year because of government cuts. As a result, he lost a vital leline. The charity said % of parents theyaposve spoken to worry about their children socialising, with many becoming clingy and unsure and not wanting to go outside.It says demand for parenting advice has risen four-fold in the past three months - prompting it to launch Parent Talk  – a new national online service which connects mums, dads and carers, with trained parenting coaches."},{"url":null,"title":"pretty little thing shopper left","story":"NewsPretty Little Thing shopper left with burns on her boobs after wearing £ top onceWARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES - Adara Graham, of Cleethorpes, Lincs, claims the Zebra-print top had rusty metal loops that burned through her skin causing painful blistersShareCommentsByCrystal Jones:,  JUL NewsAdara Graham was left with painful blisters \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Diane McCracken was advised to follow a regime of basic physiotherapy at home in Pontypridd, Wales when she began suffering from minor disc troubles.As she was stretching her neck one evening her vertebrae buckled, Wales Online reported.The -year-old was left in immediate and terrible pain. Two months later doctors discovered that some of the fluid surrounding Dianeaposs spinal cord and brain had leaked into other parts of her body. Since May she has been confined to her bedroom and is now barely able to move. If I stand or sit up, it feels like an elephant is standing on my brain, admitted Diane.The headaches are unlike anything Iaposve ever experienced before. When I lie down they mostly go away, but thereaposs still a terric sense of pressure and tugging.My nose always feels like itaposs congested, my eyes are often burning and my teeth are aching. My mind is never clear. I always feel like Iaposm very much in a fog, and I donapost sleep well at all which is probably down to the condition too. The qualied accountant was physically fit before the injury and would go running with her husband four days a week at least. Her physical condition has changed dramatically since the freak incident in March. When I did it I immediately had pain going up the middle of my head and had a severe screeching sound, she recalled. I felt a strange tingling all over my body. At the time it did worry me but I thought Iaposd probably done something structural. It took me two months to get the diagnosis from a neurologist to realise that it wasnapost structural and there was no damage to any bones or tissue.  A cerebrospinal fluid leak, known as CSF for short, was caused by a tear in her dura mater - a thick membrane that covers and protects the brain and spine. It can cause the brain to sink to the bottom of the skull and lead to severe headaches, nausea, and cognitive issues. The most physically exerting thing Diane can do now is walk four steps to the bathroom and back. From March to May, I was up and still doing things. But over time I found myself, as the days wore on, needing to lie down more and more often, she said. By May, I just felt I couldnapost get up anymore, and now I literally cannot move my head off the pillow. I can go to the toilet but I have to limit the amount of times I do that each day.

The British summer holidays are back after a dreary few weeks, with highs of between C to C forecast for parts of England on Saturday.The southern and south-east are the places to be this weekend for sunbathing this weekend, as the rest of the UK will likely get a dose of cloudy heat, according to the Met Office.The forecast suggests Kent and Suffolk could be in for the winning combination of the highest temperatures and clearest skies this weekend, a meteorologist for the service predicts. While cloud is set to linger in most parts, the forecaster says early predictions suggest the clearest skies and highest temperatures are to be found on Englandaposs eastern coastline. The hottest areas cover counties home to popular beaches Margate, Broadstairs, Whitstable and Dover in Kent. Suffolk county is home to sands covering Southwold and Lowestoft. Some Met Office weather heat maps are predicting highs of C, and a meteorologist says -C is very likely for Englandaposs south and south-east.Another weather map show the hottest temperatures will stretch to the coastline at Southampton to inland spots including London.The summer began with drab and grey skies and followed a wet June. But the sun is due to make an appearance again in days by Thursday as temperatures warm in most parts.  Elsewhere, temperatures should lt into the s by Thursday, except for Scotland and Northern Ireland which should remain cooler. Met Office meteorologist Bonnie Diamond said southern Wales and south and south-eastern England should see the highest temperatures. By Saturday, they should lt to C to C across much of southern and southeastern England, she said.  However cloud could linger in the hottest areas, leaving the coastlines of Kent and Suffolk most likely to be clear and sunny and enjoying the high temperatures too. However Ms Diamond stressed that the forecast is subject to change as the week goes on, and any holiday-makers should keep an eye as cloudy conditions could yet persist into the weekend.  Ms Diamond said:Generally this week is going to be pretty on the cloudy side for most, particularly in the north and west parts of the UK, and Northern Ireland and Scotland. That should change as the week goes on, she said. Today, temperatures for southern England are  to C, whereas Friday tmperatures in the south should be in the low to mid-twenties. By Saturday thereaposs a warmer spell and temperatures should be around C-C in south and south east England.  However much of the areas expecting warmer temperature will likely to remain cloudy on Saturday, eastern areas like Kent and Suffolk looked both hot and clear, Ms Diamond added. However that could changethe cloud lingers, she warned anyone planning staycations this weekend. The coming scorcher is one of the first since the heatwaves of the May bank holiday and late June. Temperatures in the final weeks of June were so high, British beaches were overcrowded - triggering major incidents to be declared in some, including Bournemouth and Dover.

Winter may feel a long way off but preparing now for millions of doses is vital as a bombshell report warns of up to , coronavirus deaths – double the current toll. Vaccinating against the flu protects us from that illness, meaning fewer end up in hospital beds, and enables us to be fitter and stronger to fight off the virus. Extending vaccinations to everyone over , as proposed by Labour leader Keir Starmer, is a precaution the Government should embrace. Nothing must be left to chance. The pandemic is a pivotal moment in history and how we respond, inidually and collectively, is crucial. The Government must urge, cajole and persuade specied age groups to go for a jab and it is our duty to turn up. It could be a matter of le or death. Heroes halted Blocking care workers from coming to Britain would be a self-defeating disaster – effectively banning lesaving heroes. Home Secretary Priti Patel’s immigration rules are reckless political posturing which shamefully ignore the country’s best interests.  When the goal is surely to construct a system that works effectively, locking workers out of vital jobs in a sector with thousands of existing unfilled vacancies makes no sense. We know this isn’t about raising wages or the Tories would abandon their obsession with pay-cutting deregulation and drop ingrained hostility towards trade unions.

Stephen Holgate, a professor and co-lead author of a report by Britainaposs Academy of Medical Sciences , said a second outbreak could be more serious than the one weaposve just been through. This is not a prediction, but it is a possibility, Holgate told an online briefing on Tuesday. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. Deaths could be higher with a new wave of Covid- this winter, but the risk of this happening could be reducedwe take action immediately. The UKaposs current death toll from confirmed cases of Covid- is around ,, the highest in Europe. Including suspected cases, more than , people have died, according to a tally of official data sources. The AMS said there is a high degree of uncertainty about how the UKaposs epidemic will evolve, but outlined a reasonable worst-case scenario where the reproduction number- or R value - rises to . from September  onwards. The R value - the average number of people an infected person will pass a disease on to - is currently between . and . in the UK and daily case and death numbers are falling. An R value above  can lead to exponential growth. The modelling estimates , hospital deaths between September  and June , the AMS report said, more than double the number that occurred during the first wave."},{"url":null,"title":"youtube star nicole thea not","story":"NewsYouTube star Nicole Thea did not die in childbirth, says devastated friendYouTube star Nicole Thea, from London, was just weeks away from her due date when she died, and a friend has toldthat claims she died in labour are \"incorrect\"ShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video youtube-star-nicole-thea--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news youtube-star-nicole-thea-not-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

But it wasnapost the bathersapos close brush with the harmless rays that really captured the internetaposs attention. The drone video went viral after capturing a swimmer sunburnt such a deep, angry red, he has been nicknamed aposHellboy.apos The internet reckoned creatures lurking in the deep were the least of the batheraposs worries as his epic sunburn stole the limelight. Viewers couldnapost help but notice he was spotted in the video glowing so red he could give the ruddy demon from the super-hero film franchise a run for his money.The video was shared by ABC News US on Twitter and Facebook over the weekend, but has gathered steam online since.People commenting on the clip posted by ABC News US over the weekend singled out the swimmer, labelling him “Hellboy”. Buddy burnt to a crisp,” one man wrote under the post. This is the reddest man Iaposve ever seen, Twitter user Wil Hunter wrote. SOMEONE GET THAT MAN SOME ALOE, Twitter user Emmy Hartman added.  NFL writer Warren Sharp tweeted: Drone footage of Hellboy and you wanna talk about huge stingrays  That is THE most sunburned human I have ever seen, wrote Twitter user Trey. And for those online insisting a video filter must have boosted the tomato-red suburn, a fuller clip of the same footage online shows the rays passing by more swimmers sporting much healthier skin-tones.

Edinburgh Live readers have also been sharing photos of their own weird and wonderful face coverings online.In a series of  photos, people showed how they had bought or made coverings that allowed them to show off their personalities - while keeping themselves and others safe. Some had ones with nods to their favourite film franchises such as Star Wars and Harry Potter, while others opted for bedazzled face coverings so they could still look glam.

To do so, Denise Mejia from Arkansas compared the face covering to a bra, showing how ineffective it is to wear the garment incorrectly.She began by demonstrating how wearing a bra underneath the breasts is like putting a face covering under your chin. Next she shows how letting the face covering hang off of one ear is as useless as wearing a bra only on one breast. Denise also compared wearing a mask on your forehead to wearing a bra on your chest above your boobs - totally pointless!  Finally she highlighted how wearing the covering over the mouth but under the nose was also incorrect, before placing it in the right position and adjusting the bra to match.

The Chinese government has been accused of trying to silence anyone who had earlier tried to raise the alarm before the killer bug became a pandemic earlier this year which has killed , people globally as of Monday. Dr Yan wants to expose the Chinese government saying they knew about the novel coronavirus before publicly acknowledging the outbreak. Speaking to journalist Bill Hemmer, Dr Yan said “we don’t have much time”. This is a huge pandemic we have seen in the world, she said. ”Itaposs more than anything weaposve known in human history. So, the timing is very, very important. If we can stop it early, we can save lives. She said she feared for her leshe spoke out while she was in China so fled to the US where she is currently hiding at secret location. She told Fox News: “The reason I came to the US is because I deliver the message of the truth of Covid.  If I tell it in Hong Kong, the moment I start to tell it I will be disappeared and killed. Dr Yan said she was among the first scientists asked to investigate a small number of cases of a new SARS-like virus in Wuhan on December  of last year. She claimed the Chinese Communist Party and senior university staff censored evidence that Covid- could be transmitted between humans as early as last December. “The China government refused to get overseas experts, even including ones in Hong Kong, to do research in China, she said.  So I turned to my friends to get more information. She said she spoke to a number of contacts, including one who worked at Chinaaposs Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and told them about the unknown virus. She also told them she had identied members of the same family had caught the virus which indicated there was a human-to-human transmission. Dr Yan also told that the number of cases was thought to be rising exponentially but when she took her findings to her bosses she was told to keep silent and be careful.  He warned me..., aposDonapost touch the red lineapos, she said. aposWe will get in trouble and weaposll be disappearedapos. Dr Yan said she believes that crucial information could have said lives while the Chinese government refused to let overseas experts, including those from Hong Kong, conduct research in Wuhan. “I have to hide because I know how they treat whistleblowers, and as a whistleblower here I want to tell the truth of Covid- and the origin of the SARS- Covid virus, she warned.  She added that she has records of communications with others in China, and she does fear for her le. There have been claims that doctors in China have been detained by the government for speaking out about what they have witnessed on social media. Journalists have allegedly been harassed and had their equipment seized after trying to report on the issue. Dr Li Wenliang tried to warn the world about the killer virus but was sent a chilling letter from police before he died.  The whistleblower was warned thathe refused to repent he would be punished not long before he was killed by coronavirus. Dr Yan said: She said: “I know how they treat whistleblowers.” [They want] To keep people silentthey want to reveal the truth, not only about COVID-, but also for the other things happening in China.” I am waiting to tell all the things I know, provide all the evidence to the US Government.” She added: “And I want them to understand, and I also want the US people to understand how terrible this is.

Romy, six, and Norah, , were discovered on Saturday following a three-day search after they were last seen shopping with their dad Martin Carpentier at .pm on Wednesday. His car was later found abandoned after being involved in a crash in Saint-Apollinaire in Quebec City, Canada and police continue to hunt for him and say he is now wanted in connection with their deaths. The girlsapos mum Amélie Lemieux visited the site in Lévis and saw the dozens of colourful flowers, teddies, heartfelt messages and candles left for her daughters. She then spoke to her beloved princesses and told them: From the first breath, I loved you both unconditionally. You are my whole le, my reason for being.When I look up into the night sky, you will be the stars that will guide me through my immeasurable pain. I love you madly. I love you forever. Police hope to find Carpentier, who is separated from the girlsapos mother, alive, as he is the only one who can clearly explain the events leading up to their deaths. Sergeant Ann Mathieu said officers are now focusing on the heavily wooded area after officers found objects there Sunday, leading them to believe Carpentier is nearby.  Itaposs not impossible that heaposs still alive, but we have to consider that, with the time passing by, maybe heaposs not, Sgt Mathieu said. Weaposre still searching. We never saw Martin Carpentier. We never had any contact with him. The information that we possess is related to the citizens that report having seen him.Mr Carpentieraposs girlfriend, Cathy Gingras, recorded a desperate plea to him on Friday morning, on Twitter.Martin, weaposre worried. We havenapost heard anything from you since the accident. We want to knowyouaposre okay, and the girls, Romy, Norah, she said.We want to knowtheyaposre okay...youaposre okay. Give us some news, let us know, call your parents, whatever it is. The important thing is that youaposre all all right. We just want to know youaposre all right. Premier of Quebec François Legault has described the two girlsapos deaths as a national tragedy.

The mystery sign is supposedly the horoscope of those born between November  and December . Andit was used as an official star sign today it would sht horoscopes for the rest of the year, meaning the one you have been following may actually be wrong. For example Pisces is February  to March  but could potentially actually be March  to April . NASA published the findings in a blog post in January  based on claims from the Babylonians who looked into the zodiac in a bid to try to understand the planet. However news of Ophiuchus has since re-emerged and got a lot of people talking. The space agency wrote that the Babylonians knew the signs didn’t fit perfectly with the earth’s rotation. The Babylonians lived over , years ago, the blog post reads. They ided the zodiac into  equal parts - like cutting a pizza into  equal slices. They picked  constellations in the zodiac, one for each of the  aposslices.apos But even according to the Babyloniansapos own ancient stories, there were  constellations in the zodiac. . “So the Babylonians picked one, Ophiuchus, to leave out. “Even then, some of the chosen  didnapost fit neatly into their assigned slice of the pie and slopped over into the next one.However, the matter is a complicated one. As the earth’s axis wobbles and constellations y in size, it’s impossible for the sun to spend the same amount of time in each star sign. In short, estimations aren’t perfect and there is always some room for error. At the time the findings were published, there was uproar on social media sites, with some astrology fans claiming their lives had been ruined as a result of the supposed potential changes. Phil Plait, writing for New Scientist, poured cold water on the claims by exposing exactly how the star sign system worked, and what had been left out by experts. He said: The thing is, there are more than  constellations the Sun can pass through. Some are smaller, or have fainter stars, so they get ignored. The biggest is Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer, which is a huge constellation taking up quite a bit of celestial real estate, and in fact the sun spends more time in Ophiuchus than Scorpius. Scorpius has brighter stars and an obvious scorpion-like shape, so it gets better press. He explained at the time in , that NASA didnapost add Ophiuchus or change the zodiac system, but it had been ignored by astrologers, who he said should take the blame for all this, not actual scientists.

The incident took place on July th in the Shoplian Khag area of Budgam district in central Kashmir, India. The man has been identied as Ghulam Qadir Sheikh, son of Sattar Ahmed Sheikh, a resident of Shoplian Khag in Kashmir. According to local reports, Ghulam had left his home and was on his way to work when he was attacked by a sloth bear, leaving him with serious injuries. Officials said the man was rescued by onlookers who attempted to fight off the grizzly animal. Footage shows Ghulam attempting to break free from the bear who can be seen clasping hold of the man, grabbing him and trying to maul him as he struggled to escape. Another man intervenes and hits the predator with a long stick until Ghulam breaks free from its clutches.  Ghulam was rushed to a nearby hospital and later referred to a hospital in Srinagar for further treatment.Last month, a brown bear has been sentenced to death after attacking two hikers in Italy.But animal rights groups have called for the mammal to receive a stay of execution following the attack.

A super effort so far!The postponement of the Ryder Cup until next year is just adding insult to injury now for this sports writer’s summer plans.First the Euros are pushed back until  and now this  I might have to actually get a le.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It’s been a great shame they haven’t been able to celebrate that.“The club will find some way of they get their day with that.“In terms of recruitment and brining players in, I’ll give the players here the opportunity.“I’ll take my time with that. Assurances is a strong word but certainly Dundee United as a club would have the ability to go out and do that,I can bring players that would make Dundee United a better team.“They’d have the ability to go into the market and bring players in that could make the team better.“If the need is there for me to go and do that, and the opportunity to bring players in from other places I believe is a good fit for the culture of the club and making the team better, then absolutely we would have the ability to do that.“The owner has told me he’d back me as has Tony Asghar and I’m happy with that.”As for how United’s embroilment in Hearts and Partick Thistle’s legal case against the SPFL affects his ability to spend, Mellon says that is for those higher up at Tannadice to say.An SFA arbitration  will hear the Jags and Jambos’ petition this week with league champions United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers mounting their own defences in the wake of the initial SPFL resolution and Court of Session action.“I think that’s a question for other people,” he said of the impact United’s legal costs on his playing budget.“I’ve, obviously, been brought here to try to improve a football team.“I’m here try to build relationships with fans and connect everybody, to make players understand the sacrices you need to make to improve and the other stuff will be taken care of by specialists.“They’ll get on with that, that’s what they’re here to do and paid to do, that’s not my remit.“I’ll do what I’m here to do which is digest training, see what I think our players need to do I order to keep moving them forward and then get out on the grass to put on sessions that will challenge them.“Once I see the improvements that need to be made, I’ll be strong with them and keep the standards really high.“I need to keep them fit and motivated and away we go. I’ll do that every day.“That’s just the way I work and operate as a manager. It’s stood me in good stead and I won’t change that.”Mellon’s track record in developing players is impressive with Leicester star Jamie Vardy one of his students at Fleetwood Town and Manchester City ace John Stones another at Barnsley.However, the Paisley-born coach was keen to point out another in Rangers defender Connor Goldson, whom Mellon had at Shrewsbury.He hopes to repeat those kind of successes at United.He added: “I had Connor Goldson. We developed him into a fantastic centre-back and sold him to Brighton for millions.“You take your time with them and see what they need to get better at. It was the same with Vardy, Stones and these kind of guys.“You look at it and know the qualities that’s needed for them to be a top player.“You recognise it and because I’ve been through it before and been successful with it before because the proof is there with the boys playing at unbelievable levels, I’m able to bring that to this group of players.“I know the techniques that are needed to show them. The training sessions or talking to them about things in a way they can grasp and understand to make them top players as well.“I really enjoy doing that and I’m so proud of all the boys who have turned out top players.”CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises\" title\"#CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-new-dundee-united-micky-mellon-making-right-noises embed # secretZZoTJol\" data-secret\"ZZoTJol\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Bringing back business safely remains a key priority.“The uncertainty for the airlines and passengers introduced by quarantine has unfortunately contributed to the decision by TUI not to re-commence flights for summer  from Aberdeen International Airport.#However, it is pleasing that we can continue to offer passengers flights to Alicante, Malaga and Faro this year with Ryanair.“We remain committed to working closely with our airline partners on the introduction of sustainable summer sun routes for summer  and beyond.”TUI was contacted for comment.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"wealth of shinty pictures uncovered in furnace","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsA treasure trove of old shinty photos has been unearthed in Furnace after lying in a suitcase for decades.The photograph collection belonged to former Furnace and Lochfyneside player, the late Niven #Bunty# Crawford, and turned up earlier this month when his daughter Christine Crawford was having a lockdown clearout.Christine#s nephew and Bunty Crawford#s grandson Scott Robertson told the Advertiser his grandfather#s story.Bunty Crawford was born and raised in Minard.Just before the Second World War he was taking a course at Glasgow University School of Art # and was in demand as a shinty player.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary.

Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

July , those going shopping need to have their nose and mouth covered or risk a pound fine.This comes after rules requiring people to wear face coverings on public transport became mandatory last month.Initially many experts and authorities, including the World Health Organisation , suggested face coverings were not effective in preventing the spread of coronavirus but are now recommending wearing them in indoor spaces.ndash So, has the science evolved on face coverings vw,vw,px, px\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been spotted wearing a face covering A report recently published by the Royal Society suggests that even basic homemade face coverings can reduce transmissionenough people wear them when in public.The study, based on mathematical modelling, showed thatan entire population wore face coverings that were only % effective, it would bring the R value, which is the number of people an infected inidual passes the virus on to, from . to under ., without the need for lockdowns.Meanwhile, another study which looked at coronavirus deaths across  countries found that nations which had policies favouring mask-wearing had lower death rates.In another piece of scientic research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last month, scientists calculated that wearing face coverings prevented more than , infections in Italy between April  and May , and more than , infections in New York City between April  and May .Dr Julian Tang, who is an associate professor of respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, said wearing face coverings in public places could keep the R value below  by creating an ldquoarticial herd immunity.vw,vw,px, px\"He said: ldquoIf you look at other countries outside of the UK ndash such as Japan or Hong Kong ndash they have much higher masking percentages and are way below the epidemic curves of the West.But Dr Simon Clarke, an associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said that while face coverings may reduce the spread of cough droplets, robust epidemiological evidence on their benefits is still lacking.He told the PA news agency: ldquoYou can see that theyare mechanistically obvious but that is not borne out by what actually happens.ldquoWhat is really important is that you have the right mask, fitted properly and changed regularly.ndash Are there any benefits to wearing them vw,vw,px, px\"A recent report suggests homemade face coverings can reduce transmissionenough people wear them when in public Experts say the risk of coronavirus transmission appears to be higher in poorly ventilated indoor spaces and wearing face coverings in small shops or enclosed shopping centres could help reduce the spread.Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said: ldquoLack of strong evidence of their effectiveness should not be considered a problem but the evidence is accumulating that they have a part to play in reducing transmission and also in protecting the wearer.In addition, there is also increased evidence which suggests that many people with the virus who do not have symptoms can still be contagious.Prof Neal told PA that while the evidence of the upsides of wearing face coverings is ldquosupportive rather than definitive, he adds that ldquoit is the asymptomatic or the pre-symptomatic people where the mask has most benefit at the public health level.Meanwhile a report, published last month by the University of Oxfordrsquos Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, noted: ldquoNext to hand washing and social distancing, face masks and coverings are one of the most widely adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions for reducing the transmission of respiratory infections.ndash What does this mean for those looking to go back to the office vw,vw,px, px\"Social distancing may not be possible in the office Experts say wearing face coverings could provide an added line of defence amid growing evidence of airborne transmission of coronavirus.Airborne transmission involves tiny virus-containing droplets, less than five microns in diameter, suspended in the airthat linger for some time.Dr Tang said: ldquoIn the office, it may not be possible to maintain social distancing, you canrsquot always open the windows and ventilation is probably very nominal. So wearing a mask gives an extra layer of protection.ldquoIf half the people in the office wear a mask, it would increase articial herd immunity to around %, which can reduce transmission overall within the office, just by reducing the number of people who are susceptible.ndash Are there downsides to face coverings vw,vw,px, px\"Face coverings being handed out to passengers at Vauxhall Underground station in London There are many indoor spaces, such as pubs and restaurants, where the use of face coverings may not be possible.Dr David Strain, clinical senior lecturer at the University of Exeter, said: ldquoIn these locations, strict physical distancing of more than two metres and or physical barriers should be used in order to protect the staff and other customers from the risk of asymptomatic carriers.He added that for those who will be disadvantaged by a mandate to wear face coverings, such as those who rely on lip-reading, alternatives include ldquomoving to the safer distance of two metres and removing the mask in order to facilitate communication, or the use of masks with a clear .Some experts have also shared concerns that wearing face coverings may give the wearer a  sense of security, although Prof Neal said there is ldquono evidence to suggest that is the case.ndash Are some face coverings better than others A recent study from @OxfordDemScifound

of OxfordJuly , The WHO advises a three-layer face covering in the community ndash the outer layer should be water resistant, the inner should be water absorbent and the mid-layer acts as a filter.It emphasises that a face covering alone cannot protect people from Covid-, and must be combined with social distancing of at least a metre and regular hand washing.The Government has said coverings can be made from scarves, bandanas or other fabric items, as long as they cover the mouth and nose.But scientists at the Leverhulme Centre, who studied dferent types of face coverings used by members of the public, say some coverings are not as effective as others, with loosely woven fabrics, such as scarves, shown to be the least effective.Professor Melinda Mills, director of the Leverhulme Centre, said: ldquoAttention must also be placed on how well it fits on the face it should loop around the ears or around the back of the neck for better coverage.She added: ldquoWe find that masks made from high-quality material such as high-grade cotton, multiple layers and particularly hybrid constructions are effective.ldquoFor instance, combining cotton and silk or flannel provide over % filtration,

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

Itd have to be spaghetti Bolognese. I grew up making it, and its the first exotic food I ever had - when I was  or  - and I thought, This is just the most amazing thing Ive ever had in my le. I tell the kids now and theyre like, What are you like The thing you still cant make is... Ive never cooked alligator, and Ive cooked a lot of dferent things. I presume its the same as cooking meat, but Im very adventurous when it comes to eating and cooking, I always like experimenting. Cooking is a scaffold for me, its a way to make things more digestible. I think when you can cook a iety of things, its just transplanting those ideas onto something . I had seal once, and I imagine thatd be very dficult. I had it in Newfoundland and it was a big flipper in a pizza oven. I presume you just cook it low and slow, but I wouldnt even know where to begin butchering a seal.Your favourite store-cupboard essential has to be... Salt, I love salt - and dferent ieties. Weve got a producer near us, Achill Island Sea Salt, for me I think its as good as Maldon. I love what salt does to food, and I think its sometimes underappreciated, because people are afraid of it now they think its unhealthy. Of course, salt and sugar can contribute to bad health, but anything can, it depends how you use it. When you have really good salt, it just changes the meal. Its like the petrol you put in a car, it gets it going.The kitchen utensil you couldnt live without is... Id be lost without my Thermomix in the kitchen - a food processor that can heat. Itd be between that and the blow torch. I cook so much fish, and I do so much with a blow torch. I always love showing people how to cook with a blow torch, because its just the most interesting thing, and its cool - you can do it at parties.Your late-night snack of choice has to be... Pizza or ice cream - Im very partial to pizza. Theres actually a place that does pizza Bolognese, and I love that! Its just so nice. And Im a fiend for ice cream. I try and stay away from it, because you start eating it and you cant stop. Sometimes, after work, I might go for a slice of pizza you always want this comfort. I think chefs always want comfort food, especially when youre cooking all day, you just want simplicity.Your signature dish is... Oysters and seaweed. We have a little dish with oysters, seaweed and trout roe, and we dress it with extra virgin rapeseed oil, seaweed vinegar and some sea salt, but its one we do a lot. If I have to be remembered for anything, that would be enough for me. If someone said, Oh he did a nice seaweed and oysters dish, Id be like, Thats grand.You like your eggs... Scrambled, but softly scrambled, not overdone.Your childhood dinners were... We had a specic day for everything. I remember we had shepherds pie a lot, and then fish, I never really liked the fish, I have memories of bony whiting. But it was the Eighties, so we had Crispy Findus Pancakes - they still do them! I think now theyre a trendy thing to eat, which is so funny. There was six of us at home and my mum cooked dinners for everyone. Lamb stew with barley, a lot of that, and then when the Italian revolution came in the late Eighties, my father started making lasagne and spaghetti Bolognese.Last night you ate... My brother has an Italian restaurant, so I had gnocchi. I have a Spanish restaurant and he has an Italian restaurant. I just love tapas and that sharing culture. Im always torn between our Michelin starred restaurant, and the tapas bar which serves about  times as many people.If youre ordering takeout, it has to be... Indian, I really like lamb korma with rice and peas and garlic naan.Your ultimate hangover cure is... Other than drinking more wine, Id say it depends how hungover Id be. Id either go for a run or eat a massive breakfast, the big full Irish. It really depends what spectrum Im on. I always think the best hangover cure is to actually stay in bed, get up about  oclock when its gone, but that doesnt happen too often, because Ive got two kids. Kids are good for not getting hungover too often, because they keep you on your toes.You really cannot stomach... Mechanically reclaimed meat, that annoys me a lot, and its in nearly everything now, like a chicken fillet roll, which isnt actually a chicken fillet at all, its a homogenised mess, and the pork which is on most of the pizzas. Fast food becomes junk food - its not the food itself thats bad, its what weve done to it. Fast food can be the best in the world, chicken and chips can be the most amazing meal you can have, you just have to make them nicely. Its what we do to these things, and because we try to make them as cheap as possible, it gives nose to tail a really bad name, because I love nose to tail and I love trying to use every part of it, but when you try to hoover a carcass [and make] the third breast from the bits of it, most of the time when you get chicken in a petrol station in a breaded form, its that reclaimed meat.The Irish Cookbook by JP McMahon, available now."},{"url":null,"title":"almost-100-years-family-find-grandfathers-fascinating-account-1920s-journey-across-syrian-desert","story":"When my mother-in-law Margaret McManus was clearing out a cupboard at home, she found seven pages of yellowing typewritten quarto-sized paper capturing Jamesrsquos recollections of that trip. He was a keen amateur photographer and tucked inside the pages were six of his photographs of Palmyra, all carefully captioned on the back.Family treasures uncovered during lockdown donrsquot come much better than this. Jamesrsquos words, written in the present tense, are marvellously evocative, capturing the excitement of the journeyrsquos end and the jaw-dropping sight of the ruins dating back to the st and nd centuries. Reading it now, we feel wersquore right there, standing beside him.Palmyra was devastated in  and  when Isis took control of the area, their systematic attempt to destroy the ancient site was described by the UN as a war crime. Now the Syrian government is working to restore the Unesco World Heritage Site.These are Jamesrsquos reflections on the city when he visited nearly  years ago.ldquoHalte, stop. Nouvelle Palmyre. To the weary and dust-stained traveller approaching Palmyra from the desert, these signs are welcome. Palmyra at last.Only  hours before, the lights of Baghdad,  miles away across the Syrian desert, had winked farewell. Powerful touring cars with running boards laden with baggage almost to the height of the hood, travelling all through the night and a great part of the next day, had spanned the barren expanse of desert.An uneventful journey, it is only when watches indicate that Palmyra should be somewhere on the horizon there is any interest. Every distant mound is the subject of speculation until, at last, the sun on its western course throws into relief a dark irregular shape, which very slowly resolves into patches of light, shade and straight lines recognisable as buildings.ldquoPalmyra, says the Syrian driver, ldquohalf hour.Then on through New Palmyra, a French-Arab town. Turns and twists through the narrow side streets allow occasional glimpses of the ancient city beyond and prepare for what is to come. A sharp turn to the right past a police post and there it lies ndash Queen Zenobiarsquos famous city, lonely yet magnicent even in the chaos of its ruins.The Palmyra of old may have been named the City of Palms but there are few palm trees to be seen nowadays. One sees it only as a veritable city of columns. They cover the area in reckless confusion. Some rear proud heads  or  feet in the air, as erect as the day they were set up  centuries ago. Those upstanding bear marvellously, but precariously, enormous stone blocks, which span from column to column.Hundreds, alas, lie prone, the weathered yellow stone giving some semblance to huge cornstalks, asa giant reaper had been at work. Short columns, long columns, columns in their several parts are strewn over the area in rank profusion.In this barren desert there is no lichen, moss or clinging ivy to cloak or protect the nakedness of the ruins and time has dealt out very uneven treatment. Generally the yellow stones are pitted and scarred by the violent blasts of prevailing sandstorms. In many places, the delicate carvings on the columns are almost as sharp and clear as the day they were cut. While in others, the carvings are completely eroded.Built into each column is a bracket which originally carried a statue. These were erected to honour those who, braving the perils of the desert, led the wealth-laden caravans safely from India and Persia. Every such successful venture brought wealth and renown to Palmyra and its commemoration in stone also, materially, helped to build the city.The total number of columns has never been computed, but some indication of Palmyrarsquos success in trading may be gained from the statement of a French surveyor working on the site that there were  columns in the mile-long Great Colonnade alone.All over the area stand out isolated groups which possibly, originally, were attached to some public building or perhaps lined some of the minor streets.Out of all the chaos, stands one orderly array ndash the Grand Colonnade. Viewed from the Arc de Triomphe, the dangerous state of which is now being remedied by the French authorities, the eye travels from column to column - now upright, now fallen ndash with the gaps scarcely noticeable from this viewpoint to where, over a mile away, a French military post crowns the highest of the range of hills under the shelter of which Palmyra nestles snugly.The eye travels back to where, at the foot of the hills and extending into a valley to the left, stand the square-built tomb towers, each of which must have been six or seven storeys high, where the dead of Palmyra were buried. Most of the tiered tombs have collapsed, but above the shroud of mist rising from the sulphurous springs in the valley, some stand out ndash dead reminders of Palmyrarsquos living greatness.Behind and to the left are the ruins of the main public buildings, including the marketplace and the great temple erected to the worship of the Sun God. The same sun which has witnessed all the splendours of the ancient city but now lights only an abandoned stage.To the thoughtful traveller, the journey of  hours across the desert from Baghdad to Palmyra conjures up visions of the old caravan route and brings acute realisation of the reasons for Palmyrarsquos one-time existence.The old-time caravans counted the rising and the setting of the sun  times before nearing Palmyra. One can visualise them plodding on, and ever on, to the west the slow, deliberately stepping camels and the jerky, trotting mules laden with bales of valuable merchandise, gold and precious stones. The great silence of the desert broken only by the soft pad, pad of the hoofs and the tinkle of the bells round the animalsrsquo necks.Day after day, jogging along in the great heat of the desert. Night after night, huddled round the campfire in the shelter of piled-up bales of goods, for the desert nights can be bitterly cold. Day and night, the never-ceasing vigilance to guard against not only the natural dangers of the desert but the possibility of attack by marauding tribes.One can imagine with what joy the first sight of the Palmyra hills would be welcomed. The anxieties and sleepless watchfulness would soon be over. The dawn of another day would see them safe in the desert city. Then the triumphant procession of the caravan down the long colonnade to the acclamation of the citizens, past the statues in honour of those who had previously accomplished a similar task or perhaps died in the attempt.These were the men who built up the splendour of Palmyra and brought untold wealth to Queen Zenobia. Her city became the trading centre of the East her people were the recognised carriers of merchandise between India or Persia and the Mediterranean.But Zenobia was not content. Her lust for gold and power was insatiable. She sought to throw off the shackles of dependency on Rome and found an empire of her own. For a time, indeed, she did reign as undisputed Queen of the East but the might of the Roman Emperor, Aurelian, ultimately shattered her dreams.The desert queen was taken captive to Rome where, decked out in wonderful jewels and almost fainting under the weight of the gold chains of captivity, she was led in processions through the streets. Her greed for gold led to her undoing.So long as Palmyra was in the throes of war, the trade caravans avoided it, seeking and establishing safer routes to the south. This led to the cityrsquos commercial decay and now it stands a lonely, pitul ruin on a deserted trade route.The strong light of the sun on the yellow columns turns the whole scene to gold, asin mockery of the ruins, as the car proceeds towards the gap in the hills which leads to Damascus. Then on through the valley where the silent tomb towers, like ghostly sentinels, watch the traveller depart this city of the dead, while overhead the same sun they worshipped vaunts its eternal existence, emphasising the futility of man and the mercilessness of time."},{"url":null,"title":"cant-wait-revisit-five-great-scottish-cycle-routes","story":"Put your cycling skills to the test by having a go at one of the many routes Scotland has to offer.

His approach to the art of teaching created generations for whom music became the centre of their lives, as practitioners ndash amateur and professional ndash or as appreciative listeners.Many of us referred to him as our mentor, rather than our teacher, as he seldom instructed: he showed you how to be a musician through his personal example of creativity, insight and commitment to hard work. In our innocence, we thought that it was normal for a music teacher to orchestrate the school shows, adjusting musical lines to meet the skills available ndash not only the usual Gilbert and Sullivan, but Carousel, Oklahoma and even West Side Story, guiding school age performers through its notorious rhythmic intricacies.Highers and O-Grades were the by-products of these activities rather than tick-box objectives ndash we would be pressed into service as music copyists, learning the importance of layout, legibility and accuracy as well as acquiring the dark secrets of instrumental transposition. The fact that one then had to sit in the orchestra beside colleagues coping with the results was itself a telling lesson. Many of us who went on into higher education in music were astonished to find that these skills were not always the norm in Scottish schools.As I prepare to retire as a Professor of Music from the University of Glasgow at the end of this month, I reflect that these  years as player, composer, instrumental instructor and teacher would never have been possible for a boy from the ldquoschemes but for the luck of being in the right place at the right time. However the gulf between Brianrsquos school experiences and mine still exist ndash there is inspirational work going on in many schools, but all too often there are places where youngsters are being asked to tick the right boxes, but not being stretched to their full potential. This has been the evidence of my own eyes and ears visiting dozens of schools over the years as a practitioner and more recently in observing the enormous disparity between prospective students applying for GU music degree courses ndash not in their abilities or potential, but in the quality of their musical experiences and opportunities.This is not an attack on the teaching profession: the situation reflects the constant relegation of music and the arts to the fringes of education. Whenever financial crises, or politically-motivated ldquore-organisations of local government occur, they seem to allow the parochial philistines to descend, often dismantling instrumental services, or access routes to the visual arts and drama built up over decades.We already see that some in the establishment have a vision of a post-Covid education focusing on ldquoliteracy and numeracy ndash the ldquoThree Rrsquos in trendier jargon.

Why have so many native Gaelic speakers chosen not to pass on their first language to their children  One answer is they decided the language was a hindrance, rather than a asset for their childrens future employment prospects, as they perceived it had been for them. Until this mindset is changed, the decline in numbers speaking the language will continue.The solution is increased use of the Gaelic, as a transactional language, spoken in shops, churches, public service buildings and the Scottish Parliament. This is the only way the value of Gaelic will be increased amongst its native speakers. This process could be started immediately by the SNP Government and its Gaelic speaking MSPs Kate Forbes and Alisdair Allan using the language in their workplace of Holyrood, frequently. The remaining native Gaelic speakers need to urgently validate Gaelic by using it in their workplaces. I believe this is the only way to save Gaelic as a living language.Iain Campbell, Dollar.I READ Alistair Grants article in support of retaining the use of the Gaelic language hoping to understand the need for its retention and was left feeling that he simply shot himself in the foot.He mentions the research which prophesies the danger of the day-to-day use of Gaelic dying out by the end of the decade and the fact that English is more usually spoken in families where both parents are Gaelic speakers.Now retired, I can count on one hand the Gaelic speakers I have met in my letime and like many others was rather surprised when our place names and department buildings were given Gaelic sub-titles. I know that many share the worry that tourists might be a bit baffled and misled at the same treatment of Scottish road signs.My immigrant fathers second language was English but his own language was seldom used in our home out of respect for his family, friends and fellow citizens.I can remember a school friend of mine who came from South Uist who on meeting her father in the street immediately engaged in a conversation in Gaelic in my presence. Even as a child I felt uncomfortable.Technology will ensure that the evidence of the Gaelic language can be retained but as for investing in the retention of its day-to-day use, I feel that it should is rather low down on the majority of most Scottish citizens list of priorities.Tina Oakes, Stonehaven.A MAJOR problem Gaelic faces today is that it is not valued within its home territories.In the cities therersquos enthusiasm for Gaelic medium education and bi-lingual signs are more widely in evidence.

But ministers must do much more to prevent people becoming unemployed in the first place, such as a flexible Job Retention Scheme for badly-hit sectors and areas affected by additional lockdowns.ldquoAbove all, the government must focus on getting the Test, Track and Isolate system working properly, which is vital to help build consumer confidence."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-criticises-potentially-devastating-uk-immigration-plans","story":"The First Minister said the moverisks sending the message \"that were not grateful for the contribution that they have made\" during the coronavirus crisis and beyond.Some NHS health professionals, including social workers, will be able to apply for a specic health and care visa but this route will not be open to care workers, Downing Street has confirmed.It forms part of UK immigration reforms designed to cut the number of low-skilled migrants entering the country from the beginning of next year.The post-Brexit plans also aim to make it easier for higher-skilled workers to obtain UK visas.Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, has already branded the move a \"slap in the face\" for the sector.With between six and eight per cent of social care workers in Scotland coming from other parts of the EU, Ms Sturgeon spoke about staff who \"do us the honour of coming to Scotland from overseas to work\".Speaking during her daily coronavirus briefing, she said: \"The immigration approach that they [the UK Government] are taking, particularly around social care, risks doing huge practical damage to our economy and huge practical damage to sections of our society, like social care.\"But they also risk sending a message that I never want to be sent from Scotland, that we somehow dont want other people to come, once we are out of this pandemic, from other countries to live and settle here and make a contribution or that somehow we dont value the contribution that they make.\"Because nothing could be further from the truth. Were all living under restrictions none of us relish at the moment, but that doesnt change the fact that Scotland is an open, welcoming country and I think the vast majority of people would want us always to be so and never want to see a message sent from the UK Government that contradicts that in any way.\"Ms Sturgeon added: \"In my view, it is essential that care home workers are included in any scheme for post-Brexit work visas.\"The Scottish Government will continue to make strong representations on that point to the UK Government.\"Ms Sturgeon argued \"excluding social care workers from the ability to apply for a health and care visa to come and work here is sending the wrong message and is sending message that we dont hugely appreciate the work of those staff\".The First Minister added: \"Donald Macaskill did say it was a slap in the face, that was his terminology, but I dont think he is wrong that that is the message it risks sending.\"And I would hope the UK Government, who I am sure would not want to send that message, I hope they will reflect on the risk they are running there.\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amPolice are appealing for information after a car was damaged in Kirkwall yesterday.

In order to allay concerns regarding public safety, VisitScotland, alongside the national tourism bodies of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, announced a new UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark to provide confidence for visitors, communities and tourism businesses alike, as the sector works towards reopening.Since its launch, last month, over , businesses have signed up to the ‘We’re Good to Go’ scheme. A new visitor charter was also created by the national tourism organisation aimed at encouraging safe and responsible travel around the country. Businesses are currently updating their listings on visitscotland with opening information to make it easier for visitors to plan ahead.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive said: “Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover.#The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen. It’s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.“July  marks a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this ‘new normal’, so it’s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.“We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone — visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.“For more information on travelling in Scotland visit visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After monitoring for some time to assess the condition of the animal, and to ascertain whether it was entangled or not, medics were happy that the animal was free-swimming and not caught on anything, however it is in poor condition, for which the prognosis is not good. Unfortunately, as the tide as dropped the animal stranded in shallow water. Medics say that they have remained on scene throughout the day, to monitor its breathing rate from the safety of the shore, and to ensure it is not disturbed “whilst nature takes its course.”They added that unfortunately, with a whale of this size, humane euthanasia to prevent further suffering is not an option, and with it being in very poor health and malnourished it would be highly unlikely to survive at sea. Whilst this whale is not fully grown, it is likely to weigh in excess of  tonnes, which means whilst it is stranded out of the water it is crushing itself under its own bodyweight which will cause internal damage too. Unfortunately refloating a whale of this size once it has stranded is also impossible due to its size and weight. Adult fin whales can reach in excess of  metres inand weigh up to  tonnes.The medics added: “Whilst medics are on the scene monitoring the whale, the landowner has requested that no one  attends and we would ask that everyone please respects his wishes. The local Coastguard team have also been in attendance too.”An update will follow.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It will see the installation of a new  kilovoltcable which follows the existing route from Murkle Bay, near Thurso, to Rackwick Bay in Hoy. The cable is expected to arrive by Wednesday next week, July .SSEN has said the installation of the new cable will allow for the removal of some sections of existing overhead line on Hoy, to be replaced with underground cable. Work is expected to be completed by November, following an extension of the programme to avoid construction during bird breeding season on the island.Mark Rough, director of customer operations, with SSEN, said: “We’re committed to ensuring a safe, secure and reliable supply of electricity to our customers and this critical investment project is an essential part of that commitment.“We’d like to thank all stakeholders for their feedback on our proposals during our open-door events last year. Following consultation, we’ve scheduled installation to minimise disruption on local marine le, with the works also planned to avoid the main breeding seasons for key bird populations.“I’d like to reassure our customers that our teams and contracting partners continue to adhere to social distancing measures and Government guidance to protect the safety of the local community as we carry out this signicant programme of works.”The Pentland Firth East cable was identied for replacement after routine inspections found it was coming to the end of its operational le. In July , SSEN successfully completed repairs to the cable in Rackwick Bay following a cable fault. While customer power supplies were not impacted by this fault, a long-term solution was required to maintain a safe, secure and reliable power supply to homes and businesses in Orkney.For more information on the Pentland Firth East cable replacement project, click here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

So wearing a mask gives an extra layer of protection.ldquoIf half the people in the office wear a mask, it would increase articial herd immunity to around %, which can reduce transmission overall within the office, just by reducing the number of people who are susceptible.ndash Are there downsides to face coverings  vw,vw,px, px\"Face coverings being handed out to passengers at Vauxhall Underground station in London There are many indoor spaces, such as pubs and restaurants, where the use of face coverings may not be possible.Dr David Strain, clinical senior lecturer at the University of Exeter, said: ldquoIn these locations, strict physical distancing of more than two metres and or physical barriers should be used in order to protect the staff and other customers from the risk of asymptomatic carriers.He added that for those who will be disadvantaged by a mandate to wear face coverings, such as those who rely on lip-reading, alternatives include ldquomoving to the safer distance of two metres and removing the mask in order to facilitate communication, or the use of masks with a clear .Some experts have also shared concerns that wearing face coverings may give the wearer a  sense of security, although Prof Neal said there is ldquono evidence to suggest that is the case.ndash Are some face coverings better than others A recent study from @OxfordDemSci found cloth face coverings, even homemade masks made of the correct material, are effective in reducing the spread of Covid- ndash for the wearer and those around them:https:t.co OByHnEWfBTmdash University of OxfordJuly , The WHO advises a three-layer face covering in the community ndash the outer layer should be water resistant, the inner should be water absorbent and the mid-layer acts as a filter.It emphasises that a face covering alone cannot protect people from Covid-, and must be combined with social distancing of at least a metre and regular hand washing.The Government has said coverings can be made from scarves, bandanas or other fabric items, as long as they cover the mouth and nose.But scientists at the Leverhulme Centre, who studied dferent types of face coverings used by members of the public, say some coverings are not as effective as others, with loosely woven fabrics, such as scarves, shown to be the least effective.Professor Melinda Mills, director of the Leverhulme Centre, said: ldquoAttention must also be placed on how well it fits on the face it should loop around the ears or around the back of the neck for better coverage.She added: ldquoWe find that masks made from high-quality material such as high-grade cotton, multiple layers and particularly hybrid constructions are effective.ldquoFor instance, combining cotton and silk or flannel provide over % filtration, so wearing a mask can protect others.copy -.

But he soldiered on to complete his first nine holes in an estimable  shots.Goodness only knows what happened at half time but he required only  shots for the second nine, a gross score of  and a nett  which was to be the joint lowest nett score recorded during the whole weekend.Great stuff there and with a higher handicap than all those around him and very much in contention he has nothing to lose in the second and final round.Best wishes Ross-great play!Of course that#s only one round gone but with one still to play the likeliest contenders to depose those already occupying the qualying positions could be Chris Mackinnon, Murdo Gordon, John Finlayson, Robert Macaskill or even Dan Macdonald.Chris was  , Murdo#s halves were  , John#s loops were  , Robert was   and finally young Dan was  .All these guys have a chance depending on how the leaders perform next time out but an honourable mention for John Finlayson who, like Ally Young in the RNLI Shield last time out compiled a fine score in the worst of the conditions.Sunday dawned cold, wet and very windy and both he and his companion for the day wondered at the outset whether they would be able to complete their round as the greens were already holding water.Two birdies in the final three holes of the first nine must have inspired John to dig in and that is exactly what he did to retain his chance of qualication.Although the competition is played off scratch the four players with the best two-round handicap scores will compete for the consolation #handicap# championship.A meritorious performance here to consider for inclusion might well come from Hamish Philp whose nett  off a  handicap was a terric performance in his renaissance as a golfer.Obviously off that highish handicap his numbers won#t compare too favourably with the #lower# men but two loops of  and  in the steady Saturday morning rain should give him a tremendous boost of confidence for both round two and the rest of this fledgling season Sunday morning#s weather conditions meant the scheduled ladies’ competition was abandoned without a ball being hit.However, a couple of days later a lovely sunny and warm Tuesday welcomed a small group for another round in the Glamaig Stableford competition and yet again Sandi Beatson was declared to be the clear winner.That#s four successive victories and this time the margin was six points over her nearest pursuants Sandra Dew and Shona Jackson.With respect the scoring wasn#t great but was readily acceptable within the confines of the competitors and that#s plenty good enough.The first midweek competition of this much-delayed men#s season was played for the Strath Cup.This trophy is usually decided on a season-long, best three from four scores basis but the club mandarins have to cut and paste a structure in this necessarily compressed playing season to keep the members and competitors happy so it was all or nothing in one single day.And what a day it turned out to be with warm sunshine and just a whisper of a breeze for the thirteen hours of competition.The fly in the ointment though was John-the-Greens# concept of what constitutes a #challenging# hole position on his well-nourished, nicely manicured putting surfaces.Rumour has it that he#s #a bit of a player# but as he#s yet to strike a single ball in anger the jury remains quite positively indecisive on that one.However, on the assumption that he does actually play the #great game# his mischievous positioning of pins-when he doesn#t have to try to access them-is causing some consternation and rabble#s babble.Irrespective of the pin positions however, Batman and Robin were at it again as playing companions for yet another highly successful day.Archie Macaskill and John Maclean reprised their excellent performances from round one of the Club Championship last weekend to finish first and second respectively.Off the tee in the second group of the day and having overtaken the trio of old boys in front they were the first players to log their scores and their totals were to remain nonpareil all day long despite a mighty challenge from the large group of competitors.Archie won the trophy and took the honours with  points, his two nines being  and .Going out-of-bounds with his tee shot on the fourth hole was to cost him an  but he immediately secured a birdie  on the very next hole to get him up and running again.Celebrating his th birthday on the course that very day the youngster went on to finish strongly with two more birdies in the final three holes of his round-great stuff and very well done.John Maclean is playing more golf than for many a year as the pandemic has meant that his tourism-related business is closed and is likely to remain so for the time being.But that has allowed him to play more golf, work on his game and slowly but surely his handicap is coming down. shots were required for the first half and  for the second was good enough for  points and also included three birdies so the dynamic duo obviously gel very well on the golf course.Eased out of second place by virtue of the better inward half Lou Gordon nevertheless ed a highly creditable score of pts.Lou navigated the outward half of his round in a miserly  shots and like Archie and John also had three birdies-in the space of five holes. But two lost balls off the th tee unfortunately put paid to his chances of victory.Graham Smith and Ryan Macaskill were the #best of the rest# as they both signed for respectable pts totals # the former easing the latter by….you know the story by now Graham required  blows for his first lap but a sparkling  shots for the second lap with five straight pars to finish showed guts, determination and the promise of things to come Ryan is fairly steady off his  handicap and   was pretty well run of the mill scoring for him. An incident-free round.Honourable mention in this competition for Andrew Long who after a faltering start turned-to in good order slotting four birdies in the run-in, including three birdies in the first four holes of lap two.This weekend the ladies will be competing for the #First Minister#s Quaich# while the gentlemen will play for the #Iain Campbell Memorial Trophy# # in scramble format # on Saturday with a pop-up Bogey competition scheduled for Sunday.On reflection then the golf season on the Isle of Skye is successfully up and running, the course is in excellent trim but still the times are strange.Quite correctly denied the use of the clubhouse to date and sadly for the foreseeable future the club lacks a focal point and with competitors playing with their pals social integration and interaction is exiguous to say the very least.It#s important that we appreciate and enjoy what we#ve got, reflect on what was missing from our lives for the three months of lockdown and just play golf and look forward to a brighter future.:  S Beatson pts .S Dew pts bih  S Jackson pts.: Leading Scores. .

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin .

Outgoing President Robin Cherry MBE stated that ‘these are exceptional times and as a committee we have decided to place Eugene and Leigh in post and our decision can be ratied at an AGM when it is safe to organise such an event’. Robin added: “It has been an absolute privilege to act as President of the Chamber for the past two years. “Prior to the current crisis Ballymena showed that it had a strong erse economy and as a Chamber we worked closely with all our partners to ensure the Ballymena area was seen as a great place to do business.” Robin acknowledged that the area would face many challenges in the coming months but stressed his confidence in the two new faces at the helm of Chamber.CAPABLE“I know that in Eugene and Leigh we have two very capable and committed people who will work hard for businesses and our local community. “I look forward to the time when this crisis has passed and we can once again get together again both as families and as a business community’.Councillor Reid said: “It is an honour and a privilege not only to take on the role as President of such an important organisation but also a privilege to be able to continue working for all of our businesses to ensure that Ballymena is at the forefront of the recovery process and that our economy gets back on track as one of the most vibrant in Northern Ireland.” Eugene has a strong background in business having been a manager in a large multi-national pharmaceutical company for many years.

As a Resort we realise that it is important that we have a vibrant local economy on all levels where we can offer businesses, members of the community and visitors a place where they can grow their business, live safely and socialise. “The next period will be a challenge but as a Chamber we are looking forward to taking on those challenges and I know that our local business community is filled with hard working and innovative entrepreneurs who will be up for the challenges ahead.” Tom Wiggins, Chamber’s Business Development Officer paid tribute to outgoing President, Robin Cherry. He said: “Robin is a remarkable man who runs a successful business as well as sitting on Council and taking an active role in several organisations across the Province. EXPERTISE“Robin has given up his time willingly to do whatever he could to ensure Chamber supported our local businesses.“ I am glad to say that Robin will remain as a Management Committee member and that Eugene, Leigh and the rest of the Management Committee will continue to have the benefit of Robin’s knowledge and expertise and of course his array of jokes which always help cheer up the most dficult of meetings.” Tom noted that both Eugene and Leigh have been members of the Management Committee for some time and have already shown that they are eager to do whatever they can to sustain and promote business in the local area. “I am looking forward to working with our new officials and cannot wait for normality towhen we can hold our AGM in safety and be able to meet our members in person.“ In the meantime I hope everyone stays safe and wish all our businesses good fortune as they begin to re-open and get back to some type of normality.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221104.jpg--.jpg?1594216609000\n","title":"swings and roundabouts playparks to open up","story":"From this Friday,  July, play parks and outdoor gyms across Mid and East Antrim will open again for public use, and we’re reminding people of all ages to play safe and stay safe by following the rules around health protection and social distancing.In line with the latest guidance from the Northern Ireland Executive, Council is working hard to ensure all our play parks will be open from  July, although a few play parks may not open until next week due to some essential works still needing completed.Mayor, Cllr Peter Johnston, encouraged families to enjoy the borough’s play facilities safely.“Prior to reopening, Council have undertaken maintenance checks and risk assessments to ensure that the play equipment is safe to use and that all sites are ready for use.“Following three months of closure due to Covid  we are expecting our play parks to be in high demand and widely used over the summer holiday period.“We would like to remind families that other open spaces such as beaches, woodlands and open green spaces are also great places to play, and residents could consider visiting such sites, as well as our play parks.“Andyou’re a whizz on wheels, don’t forget that Carrickfergus Skate Park will also be open to the public from Friday,  July!”Alan Herron, PlayBoard Director of Service Delivery and Development, said:“Play is a fundamental part of children lives, providing opportunities to develop physical, emotional and mental health and wellbeing, establish new friendships and develop new skills.“Research currently being undertaken by PlayBoard has shown that the period of lockdown has had a signicant impact in restricting children’s play and we welcome the reopening of play parks as a further step back towards normality.“Emerging scientic evidence suggests that the level of Covid- risk to children, particularly in outdoor locations such as play parks, is low in comparison to other groups in society. Providing play parks do not get excessively busy and that the guidance is adhered to the level of risk should be low.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council Officers have been working with PlayBoard NI to develop guidance for parents to enable facilities to reopen.Risk assessments have been carried out in accordance with Health  Safety Executive recommendations and research conducted by the UK Play Policy Forum into the impact of Covid- and children’s play.A range of measures aimed at minimising the risk of infection have been agreed and parents and children visiting play parks are asked to adhere to the following guidance:Closed Play ParksIf the play park you wish to use has not yet been officially reopened, please do no attempt to use or access the equipment, and we will get the play park opened as soon as possible.Secured equipmentIn some cases, damaged or broken pieces of play equipment may have been secured to prevent use. If an item has been secured in this manner, do not attempt to remove the temporary barriers or use the equipment.Social DistancingWhen visiting a play park make sure you follow current government guidance on social distancing, encourage and support your children to do the same and keep a safe distance from others not in your household social bubble.Busy Play ParksPlay parks may be busier than usual. If the park you visit is busy, consider coming back at a later time and let your child know in advance that this may be a possibility to avoid disappointment.Hand WashingWash your hands and your children’s hands before and after visiting the play park. Take hand sanitiser with you and ensure you and your child use it frequently whilst in the play park.Waste ManagementMake sure any disposable tissues, PPE equipment etc. are disposed of in the bins provided orone is not available take it home for disposal.Be SensibleIf you or anyone in your household are showing any Coronavirus symptoms, stay home and do not visit the play park.PlayBoard is inviting children aged between  and  to share their views about how Covid- has impacted on their play by taking part in a survey at https:www.surveymonkey r PBYourVoice "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221834.jpg--.jpg?1594293881000\n","title":"patricia ready to steer inner wheel","story":"BALLYMENA’S Patricia Perry, has been appointed as all Ireland Chairman of the Inner Wheel Organisation.

This, along with other key public health measures, such as social distancing and ensuring good hand and respiratory hygiene, will help us to reduce community transmission of Covid-.“For Test, Trace and Protect to work, everyone in Northern Ireland must prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and be tested to help protect ourselves, our families and our communities.”The Minister added: “This is likely to become part of everyday le for the foreseeable future until an effective vaccine for Covid- is developed and a vaccination programme delivered.”Olive MacLeod, Interim Chief Executive of the Public Health Agency, said: “The initial pilot phase of Covid- contact tracing began in Northern Ireland on  April and as of  May we have been tracing all positive cases. Northern Ireland was the first part of the UK to have this service established and operational. “Our contact tracing team is made up of trained staff who contact the person who has tested positive identy those people with whom they have had close contact and could be at risk of developing Covid- and in turn contact them to advise them on the appropriate next steps.”Mrs MacLeod concluded: “By this stage most people will be aware of Covid- symptoms which are a high temperature a new, continuous cough or a new loss of or change in sense of smell or taste.

It#s possible to put it in with the laundry but the key is to use some kind of detergent to destroy the lipid layer around the virus.Read More PM prepares public for announcement on face coverings in shops in coming daysCan I use a scarf as a mask Experts say using a scarf is better than wearing nothing but it may not provide much protection, particularlyit is a thin neck scarf.If the fabric is too thick, it is dficult to make several comfortable layers that would be bearable on a long journey.What about layering a mask If people make their own mask the advice is to have a minimum of three layers of fabric.Aim for two layers of a cloth such as cotton with a filter between them made of dferent material. This can include a piece of paper towel or silk.If you make a pocket in the middle of the mask the paper towel slip can be changed every time it is washed.How do I fit my mask properly Have it tightly fitting in order to block droplets coming from the mouth.It also needs to fit around the chin and cheeks. Shop-bought masks have a mouldable nose-piece which can be squeezed around the nose to anchor it.For home-made versions the recommendation is to use a paper clip or pipe cleaner.Do I need to clean my hands before donning the mask This is important andyou are at a bus stop or railway  there is unlikely to be access to a sink. Hand sanitiser should be used instead.The advice is try not to touch the mask area and only touch the straps around the ears. Wearing the same mask all day: Once it becomes damp it is less effective and can also cause skin irritation.What are the most effective masks Medical masks are regarded as best in not just reducing respiratory droplets from the wearer to others but also in preventing transmission of the virus from others to the wearer.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dee-dda--a-dcecfc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dee-dda--a-dcecfc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dee-dda--a-dcecfc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dee-dda--a-dcecfc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dee-dda--a-dcecfc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dee-dda--a-dcecfc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dee-dda--a-dcecfc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dee-dda--a-dcecfc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dee-dda--a-dcecfc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dee-dda--a-dcecfc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"People wear face masks as they shop inside Primark on Oxford Street  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPeople wear face masks as they shop inside Primark on Oxford Street Also known as surgical masks, they are made from a minimum of three layers of synthetic non-woven materials.They are available in dferent thicknesses.

But this spending only applies to Britain.Mr Gove said the investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities when the transition period ends in December. The £m package includes £m for staffing and IT systems, and £m for port and inland infrastructure. New border infrastructure will be built inland where there is no space at ports, while ports will get one-off financial support to ensure the right infrastructure is in place. The funding relates only to the implementation of the GB-EU border, and the Government will publish specic guidance and measures for Northern Ireland in the coming weeks. Mr Gove said: We are taking back control of our borders, and leaving the single market and the customs union at the end of this year bringing both changes and signicant opportunities for which we all need to prepare. That is why we are announcing this major package of investment today.Unlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland will continue to abide by EU rules on agricultural and manufactured goods. Ports here are ready to build border control points, but are still waiting for the green light from Stormont. Meanwhile, new Taoiseach Micheal Martin also said more detail is needed on arrangements following Brexit, and expressed concern about the signicant ergences remaining between the EU and the UK on a post-Brexit trade agreement. I think there has been some progress in terms of a paper that the UK Government published, but we do need more detail, we need more precision. I think we need an injection of momentum into the overall talks between the European Union and the United Kingdom in relation to Brexit, he said. I had a very fruitful discussion with the Prime Minister Boris Johnson after I took office. I think we both agreed that it#s in everybody#s interest, particularly in terms of businesses and giving them certainty, that we get a good comprehensive trade deal between the UK and European Union.Belfast Most ReadTwelfth : Thousands turn out for almost  parades across NI PSNI investigates Belfast band’s parade restrictions breachCoronavirus: Two further Covid- deaths and  new cases in NITwelfth : Hundreds ignored social distancing, but Orange Order insists #vast majority# complied Jack Charlton#s reaction to Loughinisland massacre showed just what a leader he was,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But the record books don#t tell the story of the man behind those feats, from World Cup winner, Leeds United stalwart, club manager and ultimately Republic legend.I thank this job for the privilege of watching him work, up close and personal, on the rollercoaster ride of his Ireland career, and especially the wonderful adventures of Italia  and USA .Those two World Cups were stinkers from a football point of view. But from putting a smile on the face of a nation with Ireland#s heroics at the  Euros, Jack lit up the world with his unorthodox leadership style.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJack Charlton celebrates with his assistant Maurice Setters FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJack Charlton celebrates with his assistant Maurice SettersHis tell it like it is, no nonsense approach meant his press conferences were packed .

He was welcoming, cheery and helpful when he got used to you being around, evenhe never remembered your name.And in any case he had more problems with his own Dublin media pack. They wouldn#t admit it a few years later but the reception they afforded him initially bordered on open hostility.Read More Build statue to remember Jack Charlton, say Ireland fans in BelfastHe wasn#t the one they wanted to replace their favourite son, Eoin Hand. They doubted his tactics and methods and when he forsook the genius of Liam Brady for a less subtle and more basic approach - he called it inflicting ourselves on them - all hell broke loose.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseTalks to Belfastsports editor Jim Gracey at a  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappTalks to Belfastsports editor Jim Gracey at a I remember coming away from a particularly bruising post match press conference, thinking this man isn#t going to last.But Jack stuck to his guns and his principles. His style wasn#t pretty but he got results. His philosophy was simple as he explained one late night, holding court as he did, in a hotel bar when his players had been dispatched to their beds. You play a long ball over the heads of their defenders and make them turn becausethey are facing their own goal, they can#t play.His passing reminded me there is nothing new in football. Jurgen Klopp has been rightly lauded for his Liverpool pressing game. Jack had the Republic doing that  years ago.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCharlton waves to fans after his final match in  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCharlton waves to fans after his final match in When Roy Keane was hailed as edgy in his TV analysis a few weeks back when he declared he#d be swinging punches at David De Gea and Harry Maguirehe was their manager, I rewound again to  years ago and Jack in the TV studio after the Republic had departed Italia . What would you have done, Jack  he was asked of the infamous incident when Holland#s Frank Rijkaard spat on Germany#s Rudi Voeller. While his fellow guests tut-tutted, Jack pulled no punches. I#d have chinned him!The same temptation must have occurred in those early sparring matches with the Dublin press pack.Fast forward to their first major tournament, the  Euros, followed by two World Cups in succession and they were eating out of his hand, even lighting the cigarettes he cadged from them. I remember one particular day him leading us down a long hotel corridor to the room where he would host his press conference.Every time he stopped, we stopped. When he walked, we walked.He was by then the Pied Piper of Ireland. Practically deied, he was even given his own stretches of water to indulge his fishing passion. And he was canny. Rumour had it he always paid for his meals and drinks by cheque, knowing they would be framed and hung behind the bar, uncashed … until they started putting up photocopies.There was but one voice in the wilderness, Eamon Dunphy, still lamenting on RTE the industrial, as opposed to technical, style of play being employed at Italia .It all came to a head in the press centre in Sardinia where they clashed live on TV. The entire Irish press pack sided with Jack while back home Dunphy faced the wrath of the nation. He may have been making a purist#s point but they didn#t want to know.By then, Jack could have stood for President and won by a landslide.He and his team were even granted an audience with The Pope at The Vatican ahead of their quarter-final meeting with hosts and favourites Italy.Most of the attention, however, centred on Packie Bonner and the fact the then Pope, John Paul II, had been a keeper back in his native Poland.Two days later, poor Packie spilled the shot that led to Schillaci#s winner for Italy that sent Ireland home. Packie was crestfallen, but Jack lted his mood as only he could, telling the dressing room: The Pope would have saved that.Jack himself didn#t stay annoyed for long. Prior to the USA  World Cup, we had been there for  days with Northern Ireland, playing Colombia in Boston and then Mexico in Miami. The Mexicans were due to play the Republic in the group stages and wanted to experience an Irish style. Jack wanted to see the Mexicans and travelled down from his Orlando base.And it was there he noted the problems with players wanting to take on water in the heat and being denied by the referee, something he feared would happen in the Republic game and in the event, he was controversially proved right.It was the only story in town and quickly became known as Watergate, so much so that after two days of grilling, he started his press conference on the third day by warning: If anyone asks me about water, I#ll drown them in it.Enter an unwitting Jackie Fullerton who had just travelled up from Miami with his wing man, the then BBC NI Sports Editor Terry Smyth. Jack, can I ask you about the water situation, pipes up Jackie whereupon his namesake blew a gasket.But it was quickly forgotten as the two Jacks repaired to the manager#s suite at the Orlando Hilton where an interview was recorded over pints of draught stout from the keg kindly installed by Guinness in his room. Nothing fazed Jack. Not even the weekend a Star Wars convention descended on the hotel. He travelled in the lt and shared the breakfast room with Obi Wan Kenobi, Chewbacca, an assortment of Stormtroopers and the rest like he did it every day. His World Cup hotels were always open house like you#d never see now in these security dominated days. Wives, girlfriends, families, punters... all were welcome, though he drew the line with the receptionist in our Parsippany, New Jersey hotel who kept putting supporters# calls through to his room at all times of the day and night, not realising he was no ordinary guest. I remember our last night in New Jersey when he even had the NYPD pipe band in to entertain us.And, at least, he always remembered Our Jackie#s name. He had trouble with Tony Cascarino who he called The Italian Ice Cream Man, Liam Brady was Ian Brady, the Moors murderer and he called the Taoiseach, the Teashop.At his first game, as the anthems struck up, he turned to an FAI official on the sideline and said: Blimey, I hope ours is better than that!Er, Jack that is ours, came the polite reply.Flags and anthems were never Jack#s thing and he was decidedly uncomfortable with events before during and after the infamous Night In November  when the Republic came to Windsor for a World Cup qualier amid the most febrile atmosphere ever at a football match here in the immediate aftermath of the Shankill and Greysteel atrocities and a daily litany of killing on the streets.In the heat of the moment when Northern Ireland scored, manager Billy Bingham#s No. as he still is to the present day, Jimmy Nicholl reacted as he has never done in his football le, before or since, by shouting #Up yours#in the face of Charlton#s No., Maurice Setters.On the final whistle and with their qualication still not confirmed, Charlton made a beeline for Bingham.I spotted Billy talking among his players and moved in his direction to congratulate him on his retirement and compliment him on a good game, he said in his autobiography. At least that was my intention. Instead, in a moment I still find dficult to understand, I pointed a finger at him and blurted #Up yours too, Billy#.Charlton later said he regretted the words instantly and apologised shortly after. A surreal night ended with Charlton presenting Bingham with an award to mark his retirement. Some of the people who#d been abusing me all evening are stood there cheering. I think that said it all about a crazy, noisy night, he recalled.What is less well known and what made the episode more surprising is that Charlton had travelled with Bingham and his team to an earlier group game in Albania where they roughed it together and got on famously.The madness of Northern Ireland in the darkest hours that were to precede our new dawn followed the Republic to the USA the following summer as their famous opening win over Italy was tragically overshadowed by the Loughinisland massacre of villagers gathered in their local bar to watch the game on TV.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFloral tributes outside the Heights Bar after the UVF massacre in  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFloral tributes outside the Heights Bar after the UVF massacre in The laughter out there in New Jersey died, too, as Charlton and his players treated the news sensitively and respectfully.Crates of beer had been ordered for the post match flight back through the night to Orlando but after an impromptu team meeting at Newark airport, Charlton declared it a dry plane, devoid of celebration.I awoke the next morning to see him being interviewed on the lawn below my room window at the Orlando Hilton, the Tricolour fluttering at half mast behind him as he spoke to Mark Robson, then of UTV, his cameraman Eddie Roberts and sound engineer Maurice Blair. When they all would have expected to be talking about one of the World Cup#s great results, the topic was instead a sombre one for the Sunday evening news bulletin.We all knew he was a great football manager and a giant of a character but that was when we realised the true extent of his leadership qualities. He struck exactly the right note. And it is why I will remember him with fondness and respect, in equal measure. God rest Big Jack.

But you also need to really concentrate and focus and Jules did that too.The Matterhorn Museum in Zermatt told Chris that Jules is the youngest person ever to climb the mountain, but it#s not something that the youngster is hugely bothered about.Jules is just happy to have successfully climbed a mountain that has claimed the lives of adults and professional climbers, the Skettrick Island man said. Just to have done it is incredible. It#s a nice thing that he#s the youngest but he#s not fixated on that.The Matterhorn, shaped like a pyramid, is the sixth highest mountain in Europe. It#s also the equivalent height of five #Munros# .Over  people have died while attempting to climb the peak. Tragically, a -year-old man lost his le during the Molyneauxs# climb.The Matterhorn is one of the deadliest peaks in the world, the father-of-two said.On the day of the climb it was dangerous. There was more snow than our guide has seen in  years, and there were lots of falling rocks.There was always a question mark as to whether it would be possible to reach the summit, because it#s not easy. A lot of people try and fail, and a lot of people obviously die on the mountain.One of the  climbers who left the hut with us was coming behind us on the way down and he slipped and fell m.He died and had be collected by helicopter. It#s so treacherous.For two years Jules had been dreaming of tackling the Matterhorn, ever since he competed a school project on the famous mountain.Ardvreck School in Perth and Kinross, which Jules attends, is outdoor-focused and it has been so supportive, said Chris.The former professional snowboarder, who has an older son Louis , said he still spends a lot of time in Northern Ireland when he#s not at his Scottish distillery base, where Daffy#s Gin is made.I was born and lived most of my le on Skettrick Island and we were always outdoors in the countryside, he said.Growing up, I spent a lot of time in the Mournes. I loved climbing trees and I also used to climb Skettrick Castle.The Campbell College past pupil said his love for climbing was nurtured the whole way through school as a member of the mountaineering club, meaning he#s well-placed for his son#s next goal.Jules is talking about tackling the north face of the Eiger, which is one of the most extreme climbs in the world, he said.When askedJules is a bit of a daredevil, Chris replied: I wouldn#t say that. He loves climbing. But for now we#ll just chill out, enjoy the summer and see what happens.

Males accounted for the higher proportion of absenteeism, with  men taking sick leave for stress, anxiety or depression in the three years period compared to  females.Read MoreEditor#s Viewpoint:Opinion NI ambulance staff deserve protection, as  staff took time off in three years due to work-related stressOf these  were paramedics who were recorded on the Health and Social Care Trust#s Human Resources, Payroll, Travel and Subsistence systemas having been absent from work due to stress, anxiety or depression. Meanwhile, six female officers staff members required sick leave for post-natal health concerns in the past three years.Commenting to the figures, a spokesperson for NIAS said the service recognised that signicant psychological and emotional stress is being experienced by staff in their frontline, control and support duties.We are committed to supporting all staff to the maximum extent, the spokesperson said.Some stresses are naturally associated with a first responder service like NIAS. However, these stresses can be intensied by factors such as assaults on staff, resource shortages, dficulties with sht patterns or meal breaks, the pressure of generational health crises like Covid-, and also, personal issues.Recognising such factors, NIAS began a Wellbeing Partnership with trade unions in November . This work has sought to normalise and address psychological and emotional health issues, and to encourage openness among all staff about these realities.NIAS said that since then, a range of support measures has been developed, including: training and guidance around wellbeing and resilience ious health and wellbeing events and initiatives across the Trust commencement of a Health and Wellbeing Project Manager in April  establishment of a staff-led Peer Support project, to which two staff have been seconded since August  and participation in the regional psychological support services framework launched by the Minister for Health in April .The NIAS spokesperson added: In particular, Peer Support has provided a signicant psychological first-aid and signposting service to staff following the most traumatic incidents of the past  months.This project has developed links with partners across the UK and Ireland, working closely with PSNI and HSC colleagues, as well as international experts.During the most serious weeks of Covid-, over  Covid-related staff contacts were proactively initiated by Peer Support to help staff. A review of Occupational Health provision is currently ongoing. The need for additional resources and expert psychological support has already been identied.Recently, an increase in attacks against staff has caused even greater trauma and added stress to our teams. These attacks need to stop.Last month the NIAS revealed that assaults on ambulance staff soared to  incidents in May after dropping signicantly during the March and April lockdown.Some of the incidents involved patients spitting at NIAS crews, urinating over equipment and telling staff that they had coronavirus and intended to pass it on to them.As a result of the Covid- restrictions on movement, ambulance crews had been at a lesser risk of assault in public places -but since the easing of the regulations, physical and verbal attacks have surged.A spokesman for the Unison union, which represents the overwhelming majority of Ambulance Service staff, added: Unison has been working constructively with the NIAS in an innovative partnership project to protect and improve the health and wellbeing of all staff, given the particular levels of stress faced by these key workers.

Pic Pacemaker FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Orange Order parade through Kilcoole Park and Kilcoole Gardens in . Pic PacemakerGareth CrossTwitterEmailJuly   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailPolice have confirmed they are investigating a band parade in north Belfast on Saturday evening that defied a Parades Commission ruling.The Parades Commission had ruled that the Kilcoole Community Band could not enter Kilcoole Park and Kilcoole Gardens as part of their Eleventh Night parade.However the band defied the ruling and marched through the area as planned.Belfast DUP councillor Dale Pankhurst criticised the limitations imposed by the Parades Commission and told the Belfastthat everything passed off peacefully on Saturday evening.In previous years Orange Order parades have been allowed to pass through the area. A PSNI spokesperson told the Belfastthat police are aware of a potentially unnotied parade in the Kilcoole Park area on Saturday.A number of those participating have been identied and we will seek to identy others, the spokesperson said. Enquiries are ongoing and any potential offences will be reported to the PPS for their consideration.A spokesperson for the Parades Commission said that it had received information that the parade took place on Saturday evening and that it was now a matter for the PSNI. The commission spokesperson explained that they had determined on July  that the parade could go ahead with a route restriction prohibiting the parade from entering any part of Kilcoole Park and Kilcoole Gardens. The commission determined that the parade may instead process a section of the Ballysillan Road, the spokesperson said.  “This decision reflected the community relations impacts of this parade in this area.The spokesperson said that the commission informed the PSNI in writing on Friday evening that it could not accept a sensitive parade notication at close of business.The parade was therefore un-notied to the commission. Un-notied parades are a matter for the PSNI, the spokesperson said.“Given the unique circumstances of this year’s Twelfth due to Covid-, the commission acknowledges the high level of responsibility demonstrated by the overwhelming number of parade organisers.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDUP councillor Dale Pankhurst  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDUP councillor Dale Pankhurst Councillor Pankhurst said that he did not believe the parade broke any rules.He said that he understood a new application had been submitted after the commission waived the  day noticaiton ruling given the Covid- pandemic and the large number of late submissions due to the changing situation around the coronavirus regulations.The law allows for this as I understand it. Notication was given to both the PSNI and the Parades Commission. As this was a revised application and no determination issued on it, no law was broken and everyone had an enjoyable evening, the DUP councillor said. Councillor Pankhurst said despite the concerns of the Parades Commission the event passed off without incident. Their initial decision had the prospect to undo the many years of good work community workers have put in to building up relations in this part of north Belfast, he added.Despite their claims that community relations would be #damaged#, the exact opposite occurred. Everything passed off peacefully, just like I and parade organisers said it would.

Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Molly Elliott died on June . Molly, who lived in the Top of the Hill area of the city, was -years-old. Her sudden death has left her family and many friends heartbroken. Mollys family say they do not want her death to have been in vain, and have urged her friends and other young people to speak to others about problems they are experiencing. Addressing the congregation at Mollys funeral last week, her aunt, Lynn, asked for prayers for all those without hope. googletag.cmd.push “Help all the young people here today, help them Father to talk, to listen, to hear and to seek the help they need. “This is not the answer,you could all just look to your left, to your right, front and back, you will see mums and dads praying this is not coming to their door. “Please, please let our beautul Molly be the last,” she said. Also speaking at Mollys funeral service, Father Michael Canny said she was a person who had time for others and would chat with themthey were feeling down. “Of course, immediate and extended family were important to her,” said Father Canny. googletag.cmd.push “She also was a volunteer at Hillcrest House and involved down through the years in their summer schemes and other things. “The days ahead will be challenging, most of us will go from here but the immediate family will be left on their own to try to pick up the pieces of le again. “It won’t be easy, le will go on, le goes on, but for you le will be much, much dferent. “But at the same time I think you will be able to reflect on Molly and on the dferent rays of sunshine she brought into your lives.” Mollys uncle, Denny Elliott, said she loved giving and receiving hugs. “She was bursting with affection and would give you hugs that you felt the love flowing from her into you. They’ll now stay with us forever,” he said. “She never shut up - ‘wait til you hear’ she’d say and then you’d just listen and not get a word in edgeways. “Those one way conversations will now stay with us forever.” Mr Elliott said his niece was someone who was there for everybody. “Only last week, Mollys best friend felt a wee bit down and did the right thing, reaching out to his best friend Molly, not knowing for the last time. “Come down for a wee chat and a hug, she said. That chat will stay with him forever.” Mr Elliott said Molly loved her family deeply but they were struggling to come to terms with her sudden death. In a direct message to Mollys friends and other young people, he quoted renowned poet Walt Whitman who wrote ‘the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. “What will your verse be ” Mr Elliott asked of young people. “Let Mollys verse be this: No other young person who knew her or reads about her will ever feel the need to end their le but instead reach out all around them and share their fears, doubts and insecurities to their mothers, fathers, siblings, carers and friends and relations.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I have had several queries from dferent sources about why we can’t just go back to normal appointments. I have prepared a short pieceyou wished to publish in your respective papers. Due to COVID- GP practices have had to adapt like everyone . Despite the wishes of staff and patients that we go back to normal services which includes letting people book their own appointments, it just isn’t possible. googletag.cmd.push We have a duty to all patients as well as our staff. Before any attendance at the practice you will be contacted to make sure you do not have COVID- symptoms. This will be similar for any appointments. We must also remind people not to attend any public placeyou are ill as you should be isolating and getting tested. All services like immunisations, and advice regarding any condition can still be accessed. Practices have become very efficient and even our practice staff are triaging calls to help the smooth and speedy delivery of services. We also have new team members, like physios, social workers, pharmacists and mental health workers. It is vital that you are connected to the correct team member to sort out your problem. googletag.cmd.push The reception staff may ask details regarding the problem to help this process. Practices are still asking people to attend the surgery for tests or examination and to avoid unnecessary trips or exposure we are also using things like video consults. Despite the talk about the ending of lockdown, COVID- is not ending. It is still there and will spread unless we continue to take precautions. This means we cannot have waiting rooms full of patients and allow someone to land in with symptoms and possibly infect a whole waiting room. If you attend the surgery you will be asked to wear a mask. It remains good practice to wash your hands regularly and wear a maskout. Despite the end of lock down, high risk patients remain high risk, and while the government restrictions do not apply, personallyI had been shielding I would continue to limit my contact with crowds during to the risk of infection. We do not have a vaccine yet, and according to figures we are nowhere near herd immunity levels, so any thoughts that COVID- is over are premature. This explains why GPs cannot go back to how things were pre-COVID and may not be able to for some time.We thank the public for their support in this.“ Dr Paul Molloy Western LMC Secretary.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In April of this year Debenhams announced that administrators had been appointed to protect the business. It aimed to open as many stores as possible once Coronavirus restrictions were lted. However, the company said that it would liquidate all  stores in the Republic of Ireland and they were not expected to reopen. More than , Debenhams workers in Ireland were notied that they’d lost their jobs. The Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said the company has treated its Irish workers in a very shabby way in depriving them of redundancy entitlements and he believes the law must be re-examined. googletag.cmd.push The Foyleside store reopened once permitted to do so by the government. Today, the Derry News asked Debenhams the long-term future of the store in Derry has been secured at this stage and whether it expects any jobs to be lost due to the COVID- crisis. In response a spokesperson simply said there have been no updates since the store reopened. At the weekend, Debenhams workers from as far afield as Cork protested outside the Debenhams store on Foyle Street in Derry to make consumers aware of what they described as their employer’s despicable actions. However, Mandate Trade Union says the company didn’t set aside finances to pay the workers their agreed redundancy package, having transferred valuable assets to the UK parent company. googletag.cmd.push Valerie Conlon who worked in the Debenhams store on Patrick Street in Cork for  years said: “We are not going to let this company just walk away and not pay. We’ve given decades of service and helped make huge profits for Debenhams so for them to just abandon their responsibilities is a disgrace.” She added: “We will be making everyone aware of how Debenhams treats its workers, andthat means traveling six hours to Derry, so be it. If they can do this to us and get away with it, how do we know it won’t be the workers in Derry next ” John Douglas, Mandate General Secretary said: “I have to commend these workers for standing up and fighting back against their despicable treatment. They’ve travelled to Belfast, they’ve protested outside the Dail, they’ve stood on picket lines all across the country and they’re not going to back down. “These workers have a combined service of over , years. They deserve a satisfactory resolution to this dispute and the company knows what it needs to do. Pay the workers the redundancy they are owed. If they don’t, Mandate Trade Union will continue to support the workers as they campaign for justice.” Niall McCarroll of Derry Trades Union Councilrecalled Clery’s Department store in Dublin closing in  leaving nearly  workers out in the cold, with no redundancy package. Fast forward to  and another  workers face the same situation as Debenhams retail Ireland closing  stores. Retail workers will face growing uncertainty over jobs as we attempt to come out the other end of COVID-. DTUC encourages all retail workers in the city to get organised, join a trade union and begin to strengthen the resistance against the self interests of big business. The demand to strengthen workers rights through more effect legal frameworks must also be met. In the meantime it is imperative everyone stands with the Debenhams workers, in their fight for a decent redundancy package and to be treated with respect and dignity.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Now, at the age of , the well-known Derry man has finally done it. Over the last couple of years, Paddy has been writing his memoirs and, from next week, the Derry News will be publishing extracts of his ,-word story. It is a fascinating story which takes in many aspects of his le, from growing up during World War  to running a business in Derrys city centre throughout the Troubles for  years. However, his working le is only part of Paddys story. After retiring, he embraced a love of learning and graduated with a degree in Irish History and Politics from the University of Ulster at the age of . googletag.cmd.push He admits that he was like a grandfather figure to his young fellow students. He continues to enjoy reading and learning about a host of subjects, particularly history. He is a man who likes to keep busy. “I did not want to retire and spend all day sitting in a chair zapping at the TV,” he said. As a result, the last couple of years have been spent working on his memoirs. Paddy was born in  at  Lone Moor Road, the fourth of eight children born to James and Mary McCaul. Paddy admitted that it had been emotional in writing about his parents. googletag.cmd.push “It was only when I was older that I appreciated how good and hardworking people they were,” he said. “My father would have worked all he could to provide for his family and my mother did everything to make sure that her children were fed and looked after. “I have such admiration for my parents but they were people of their time and thats how things were then.” After leaving school, Paddy worked as a clerk in the Great Northern Railway and the City Surveyors Department in Derry. He started employement as a salesman with electrical appliance company Electrolux in . Through relationships built up in this job, he opened his own shop, McCaul Appliances at John Street in . Within a few years, John Street and the rest of the city centre was targeted regularly as part of the IRA bombing campaign. Paddys shop did not escape. In his memoirs, he recalls on one occasion being held at gunpoint as a bomb was planted in the store. He recalls: “My main focus was not on what was obviously some sort of device but on the shaking hand which held the rather ancient-looking hand gun.” McCauls Appliances relocated for a time to the Waterside, before finding a new base at Quayside Shopping Centre where the store remained until Paddy retired in . However, as already stated, Paddy was not keen on taking things easy during retirement. “I always like to keep active and did not want to end up doing nothing when I retired,” he said. He signed up for a Diploma in Foundation Studies for mature students at the University of Ulsters Magee campus in . He is in no doubt about the impact this had. “That course changed my le,” said Paddy. “I had always been interested in reading since I was a young boy and had enjoyed my time at school. “However, coming from a working class family, the focus was always on getting out of school and finding work so you could start contributing to the family. “So it was great to get the chance to indulge my interest in learning at that later stage of my le.” Paddy said he gained a new lease of le mixing with his young student colleagues and is a big advocate of the importance of education. Despite being in his th year, the Derry man keeps himself active with daily walks along the citys quayside. In his long and eventful le, he has seen many changes, some good, some not so good, in his home town. It is a place he is very proud of and very proud to come from. Whilst acknowledging that he would have been well known in Derry, especially through his involvement in business for many years, Paddy describes himself as just an ordinary Derry man. He says he hopes people enjoy reading the story of his le. He insists it is just the story of an ordinary man. Often, those are the best type of stories.

This sweet and gentle dog was stray for quite some time and covered over  miles on his travels, carrying on even after he was hit by a car. Thankfully, he was brought to Friends of Rescue who gave him a full MOT before nursing him back to health in foster care. Now Miles is looking for a home to call his own, with a very secure garden. We were tracking Miles for over a week and there were sightings of him all over the place, said Friends of Rescue founder, Suzanna Flemming. googletag.cmd.push He was on the run and losing weight quite rapidly. He was hit by a car and still kept running. Thankfully he had no broken bones and was just a little stf and sore, but he had a lot of scarring on his body new and old. After a well deserved bubble bath he was wormed and flead and we got him into foster care and got him fattened up a little bit and neutered, chipped and vaccinated. Miles is a special dog and will need a special home. He is doing his very best in foster but he is still a very nervous man and he will need time, reassurance and most of all patience, said Ms Flemming. googletag.cmd.push Miles would benefit from another dog or dogs in the household but no young children, and this is purely down to his nervousness. And hell obviously need an extra secure garden so that he doesn’t ‘try a Miles’ again He will make an amazing family member. He is sweet, gentle and forgiving. Friends of Rescue had to close its doors due to lockdown but since lockdown has eased it has  dogs and  cats in its care. We have been very busy since the travel restrictions eased, whether this is down to people going back to work, we dont know, said Ms Flemming. The charity started as a rehoming blog around two and half years ago but one dog turned into five and it became a rehoming charity. Friends of Rescue now has six or seven foster families who look after rescued animals while they are treated at the vets and assessed for what type of family would suit them. If you would like to offer Miles a loving home or find out more about the charity you can visit the Friends of Rescue Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Speaking to the County Derry Post, as part of the in-depth look at Ulster hurling, both referred to the competition being at its peak during the nineties when Down and Derry were challenging for titles. McCann, who expressed that Antrim would not have any aspirations of being part of the talked about Team Ulster concept, said the Saffrons would be mad keen for aof the Ulster senior hurling championship. The Creggan man is one of two or three to have ever played in the Ulster championship, but feels there would need to be a reward and spoke of how the automatic entry to the All-Ireland semi-finals now being a thing of the past. googletag.cmd.push “Id say we would be mad keen to get it back,” McCann said. “If there was some sort of reward for winning the Ulster championship, you would get a better buy-in from all the teams and when they removed that, it was a road to nowhere.” Down manager Sheehan had a dferent opinion on the need for qualication into the Liam McCarthy Cup to make the Ulster championshipviable. It would be a massive incentive, but felt that Derry and Down would not be at the level of Leinster or Munster and the Joe McDonagh Cup would be their level. googletag.cmd.push McCann felt that the new tiered championship has been really good for Antrim. Last years Joe McDonagh Cup threw up competitive games and their clash with Offaly was among the best games he has seen, but not enough were able to witness it.  Antrim senior hurling captain Conor McCann “It is a shame they are never on TV, the GAA never listen and never do anything about it. They show the odd game and I have no doubt the Christy Ring is the exact same. If the promotion was better, it would definitely help,” McCann stated. Sheehan said he would love to see aof the Ulster championship and its absence reflected poorly on the province. While he accepts Antrim would general win it, he points to Derry winning the last U final and beating Down in the final. “The reality is, an Ulster championship medal means something to people andAntrim felt they didnt want to partake in it, Derry, Down Armagh and the other teams would have an interest in playing in it...but clearly you want Antrim in it,” Sheehan said. The Newry Shamrocks man looked towards Derry or Down being in Division A next season and Antrims chance to be in Division , should they beat Kerry. “That a good for Ulster hurling. It is indicative of the fact there are good hurlers in the province and there are guys in the province who are passionate about it,” he added. Sheehan also mentioned the topic of dual counties trying to attract players to the hurling . “It is very hard to do that, when those lads can get provincial recognition playing in a provincial championship and get on the TV. Their chances of getting some kind of coverage is increased, yet we dont even have our own championship at any level – senior, minor or U. “I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” Sheehan adds. He also indicated how Derry and Down would love to get a crack at an Ulster title. References were made to the crowds at Slaughtneils recent games with Dunloy and Ballyhale. “We are being denied the opportunity to have a show-piece for Ulster hurling and I just think that is wrong. It is the very minimum the Ulster Council should be doing,” the Down boss pleaded. So when do you play it  “Fixtures is something you can always work your way around,” said Sheehan, who was the GPAs representative on the National Fixtures Committee setup by President John Horan last year. “Ideally, you would like to see it played in the summer. I dont know why, with the right kind of work, at the very least the first step could be taken where they could look to morph the McGurk Cup into the Ulster championship. “If we are playing in a pre-season competition, there is no reason why that cant be built up on. Either make it an Ulster championship or mirror it and give people summer hurling.” He doesnt buy into the scenario of clubs clashing with county in the summer. Sheehans solution is train with the county once a week. Give them back to their clubs but still play in the Ulster championship. “Nobody pays the players wages so no manager, club or county, should have exclusive rights to players,” Sheehan stressed. “Players want to be playing matches and managers shouldnt be stopping them from doing that.” Conor McCann agreed on a summer slot for the Ulster hurling championship, but it demanded more respect. “It should be having more of a stature, other things should be moving out of the way for it,” he stated. “We shouldnt be talking about squeezing the Ulster hurling championship in.

The Laois man and former Dublin U boss said it would be elitist and wouldnt do anything to improve hurling in the Ulster counties. “To be quite frank, no I am not in favour of it,” McEvoy told the County Derry Post, pointing to the rising tide in Ulster hurling. “Donegal are on top of Division A with Armagh. Derry and Down are on top of Division B. Antrim are on top of A.” McEvoy did admit that it was a Dublin Colleges amalgamation hurling team that started the ball rolling in Dublin. googletag.cmd.push “Youve got to start at the grass-roots,” McEvoy stated. “There is a massive amount of grass-roots work happening in Ulster.” He mentions the Celtic Challenge success for Derry, Antrim and Down. More can be done to promote hurling in Ulster, he feels, in terms of promoting national leagues from Division A down. McEvoy wants all league finals to be played in Croke Park and given the same recognition as football. “Theminor finals are in Croke Park, from the same traditional counties . “I am of the view that there should be a festival of hurling on All-Ireland weekend. The Joe McDonagh, Christy Ring, Nicky Rackard are played on a Saturday and on the Sunday, there is the All-Ireland . googletag.cmd.push “I personally think wedevelop the game we have, we have a good product and it will only benefit from what we are trying to do in the likes of Ulster.” A combined team may work at  or  years of age, but an Ulster senior team isnt a solution, the Derry manager added. “Where would it fit in the calendar  I think it is elitist. Is that going to improve hurling in Derry, or Donegal or Down  I dont think so.” McEvoy is in his second season as Derry boss and hasnt played in the Conor McGurk Cup or the Ulster championship in that time. He feels the players would want the championship back. “I can see the benefit of having an Ulster championship, as opposed to having a consolidated team from all the dferent counties, which is not going to benefit hurling in the dferent counties,” he said. “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” he added. Despite the poor weather in January and the players tied up in the Club All-Ireland, McEvoy also would see a benefit to it being played in pre-season. “I think that has merit, because it would give you more competitive games. In pre-season, you are looking for challenge matches and surely by having a provincial championship would give you that.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bernadette Radclfe, from the Brandywell, bought a ticket for a competition to win a black Lamborghini Gallardo on a whim when she saw it advertised on social media. Mrs Radclfe had just a one in , chance of winning the prize from Derry company Vogue Competitions She couldnt believe her luck when she got a call from Derry singer and entertainer Micky Doherty who had picked her name out using a computerised random number generator. Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March. The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will be no official Orange Order parades after the organisation announced their cancellation earlier this year. Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Based at the former St Josephs Parish Centre in Galliagh, the new St Pio Centre will be a place were the Friars can carry out their work. The Franciscan Friars first came to Derry in  at the invitation of Bishop Seamus Hegarty. They lived on Abercorn Road for five years before relocating to the Parochial House at St Josephs parochial house in Galliagh, which is now St Columbas Friary. The Friars have since become a familiar sight in the local community and have built up strong relationships with the people who live there. googletag.cmd.push After their arrival in the city  years ago, they became chaplains at St Brigids College and also work closely with Heal the Hurt counselling and addiction service, as well as preaching and teaching. The Friars also celebrate mass at the White Chapel in Galliagh on Tuesdays and Fridays and one weekend a month. It has been great to meet people, said Fr Isaac, one of the Friars. We are not parish priests so its not something we usually have. We feel very much part of the Derry community now, especially in Galliagh. In Spring of , the parish riest of the parish of the Three Patrons, Fr Michael McCaughey, approached the Friars about taking over the former parish centre. googletag.cmd.push After a long series of meetings we decided to lease the centre from the parish and the construction process began, said Fr Isaac. The Friars have knocked down almost half of the old parish centre to create the new Apostolic Centre, which will hopefully be completed by the end of next month. The funding for the new centre was raised by the Friars and the local parish with the help of a number of benefactors. Its our place, explained Father Isaac. Its our first place in the city to do that work that God is calling us to do. The St Pio Centre will have a coffee bar. It will have beautul furniture, and be really well lit with music playing and it will be a place for the Friars to connect with their neighbours, said Fr Isaac. It is our desire that our neighbours in Galliagh will come, but it is open to anyone. Fr Issac says the work of the new Apolistic Centre will be guided by the needs of the local community. We are really excited, said Fr Isaac. In the  years that we have been here we have able to plug into the already existing groups and we have been so blessed to be a part of them. People have asked what sort of services will be available but we will see what needs present themselves,” said Fr Isaac. And we will continue to work with the organisations that we are already closely working with.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara McNicholl, from Moneyneena, wowed the judges with a stirring rendition of Whitney Houston’s ‘I Have Nothing’. The Moneyneena native made his singing bow in a school play, but his modesty meant his teacher had to ring and let his parents know. “I’ve only really been singing properly for about three years,” he told viewers in the run-up to his performance. ”I just used to hum, but secretly I’d go out into the car and sing along to the radio. Getting on the stage and looking at the amount of people staring at you is much dferent to being in the car. googletag.cmd.push ”Hopefully I have what it takes to make one of the coaches turn around.”  Dara’s parents, Donna and Chris watch on proudly from the wings. In the end, proud parents Donna and Chris watched from the wings with host Emma Willis as all four judges stood up and took notice. Will. I. Am and Danny Jones spun in their seats immediately and it didn’t take long for Paloma Faith and Pixie Lott to follow suit. “You didn’t miss a note, it was crystal-clear. I was blown away by your voice and it gave me goosebumps,” said Paloma Faith afterwards. “I’m actually lost for words, because I feel like I’m in the presence of something really special. I don’t think you realise how good you are,” added Danny Jones. googletag.cmd.push Producer Will.I.Am told Dara he hoped to bring out the best in his abilities, while Pixie Lott said she like the idea of instilling confidence in him as the show progressed. In the end, the St Colm’s Ballinascreen U hurler opted for Team Paloma to take him forward in the competition.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Magnicent Seven Crew is a project made up of singers and musicians from Derry, Dungiven and Sligo. They recently joined forces to help Foyle Foodbank with their role of providing food for those who are experiencing food poverty. The entertainment industry has been hit hard as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. With pubs closed, many singers and musicians lost their main source of income overnight. However, many local entertainment figures have been involved in fundraising initiatives during the lockdown. The Magnicent Seven Crew project was coordinated by local musician Leo Fitzpatrick who through his vision, enthusiasm, talent and commitment managed to achieve their target of pound, for the local foodbank. googletag.cmd.push The project saw up to  entertainers perform from home and encourage donations from those who tuned in nightly to see them. The Magnicent Seven Crew project went live on Facebook on Friday, May , and within eight weeks had achieved its target. Speaking on behalf of the Board Of Directors and volunteers at the Foyle Foodbank, Damien McAdams praised everyone involved in the recent fundraiser. “Night after night the entertainers give freely of their time and talent to produce a series of excellent performances,” he said. “Some of the performers it should be noted have lost their main source of income as a result of this pandemic and some are dealing with their own dficult health issues yet they have been determined in their willingness to help those most in need. googletag.cmd.push “The generosity of the Derry public and further afield has been amazing. “Its important to point out that all of the performers performed free of charge and all donations went to the Foyle Foodbank.” Mr McAdams added: “We would like to take this opportunity to thank all those singers, musicians and Leo Fitzpatrick for their magnicent achievement. “We also wish to acknowledge the great generosity of all those who donated in any way to the Foyle Foodbank.” The Foyle Foodbank says it has seen a sharp increase in demand for help during the lockdown period.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As of July, they are full-time employees of the Club and they’ll be getting paid to play the sport they love, commentedAcademy Manager, Ricky Martin. “This will also provide them with an opportunity where they can spend more contact time with the Academy, as they will now be undertaking daily training and educational programmes. googletag.cmd.push “I would like to take this opportunity to thank the players’ parents for their dedicated support in their sons development at the Academy, which has meant several trips every week for them to training and matches.

Forbes, from Ardboe, is one of eight new additions to the clubs Academy on a a full-time scholarship deal. “This group of players are at a pivotal moment in their footballing development as they transfer from being schoolboy players into a full-time football programme. As of July, they are full-time employees of the Club and they’ll be getting paid to play the sport they love, commentedAcademy Manager, Ricky Martin. “This will also provide them with an opportunity where they can spend more contact time with the Academy, as they will now be undertaking daily training and educational programmes. googletag.cmd.push “I would like to take this opportunity to thank the players’ parents for their dedicated support in their sons development at the Academy, which has meant several trips every week for them to training and matches. Now, they are able to see their sons become more independent and have more responsibility for their development, as they become full-time players.” Forbes was refereed to as a tough-tackling centre-half on the Hammers website after his recent arrival at the club. He came in on trial and got on really well with the lads. I think he could have a big future at the club hopefully he can attack pre-season training and show everyone what he’s all about. googletag.cmd.push Michael follows in the footsteps of fellow St Pius pupil Aaron Donnelly who signed for Nottingham Forest. They played on the same school GAA team and Forbes was on the side that qualied for this seasons MacLarnon Cup final. RELATED- St Pius and St Patricks may get to play in showpiece finals.

That acted as the trigger.ldquoWhen my mother died a few years later, I brought my father over to live with us and he has since settled in well.ldquoWe are surrounded by horses, hens, dogs, cats, lizards and a few snakes. Maybe not you average farm animals, but we do have stunning views of rolling drumlins, forests and two beautul lakes.ldquoI feel there is an inspirational current with the weather in this part of Co Down.

I felt I was just limbering up to a career in writing, cutting my teeth and learning with each page.ldquoWith the books that followed, I grew in confidence and delivery until I felt I could begin to publish them.Kerryrsquos first stories were historical fantasy which she enjoyed working on tremendously, so much so that as more fiction followed, so did the acclaim.She said: ldquoIrsquove been lucky enough to win an ACNI SIAP award in  and then a second ACNI award earlier this year. A short story I wrote called The Armada Tree,won Kraxon Magazinersquos Story of the Year Award.ldquoI am lucky enough to belong to some brilliant writing groups, not least the Hexmen, the Yellow Door Group, and the Belfast Writers Group.

which inform drivers about their speed are to be erected in Downpatrick, Newcastle, Killyleagh and Castlewellan by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.The signs are to be erected at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick, Newcastlersquos South Promenade, Castlewellanrsquos Dublin Road and the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh.A total of seven signs will be erected shortly across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area as part of the major clampdown on speeders.The move has been welcomed by a number of local councillors including Dermot Curran, Willie Clarke, Billy Walker, Gareth Sharvin and John Trainor who say that the new signs have the potential to save lives by encouraging drivers to slow down in what are heavily populated areas.Cllr Curran said that drivers regularly ignored the mph zone along a large stretch of the Strangford Road.ldquoThis area is densely populated and there are always people walking at this part of the town. A number of accidents at this location have been blamed on speeding, with residents highlighting their concerns about the issue for some considerable time, he continued.ldquoThere is a clear and obvious need for the authorities to get to grips with the speeding problem and the PCSP deserves praise for this initiative. Unfortunately, many drivers think a large part of the Strangford Road is governed by a mph limit which is not case. Residents I have spoken to about the problem say the speed of some vehicles is frightening to say the least.Cllr Curran said that were many housing developments accessed via the Strangford Road which carries a high volume of pedestrian traffic.He added: ldquoWhile welcoming the speed indicator sign, I believe there is a need to move the mph limit back beyond the former Down Council headquarters. Speeders need to slow down before someone is killed.Cllr Sharvin believes one of the real benefits of the announcement is that it has ldquokick-started and energised a conversation among the public about other hot spots for speeding.He added: ldquoI recognise that these signs are an expensive investment but, ultimately, the success of them will be measured in how the public respond to them. If we can begin to see speeds lowered across the district and lives potentially saved, the scheme will have been a success.Cllr Trainor said he hopes the new signs will raise further awareness in driversrsquo minds on the need to reduce their speed along these stretches of road.He added: ldquoWe know that the Strangford Road is a hotspot for speeding traffic and the dangers associated with this. If the new signs reduce speed and help save lives they will be worthwhile, but but road safety is everyonersquos concern.Cllr Clarke said he is ldquodelighted that one of the new signs will be placed at Newcastlersquos South Promenade which carries a huge volume of traffic.He said news of the speed indicator sign will be welcomed be residents who live at this part of the resort and the many pedestrians who walk in the area will be encouraged by the initiative.ldquoI hope that the sign will go some way towards tackling the issue of speeding at this busy part of Newcastle, he said.ldquoThis is a welcome move and something that Sinn Feacutein has been lobbying for over many years to protect residents who live at this part of the resort. The speed sign will also hopefully make South Promenade safer for pedestrians.Cllr Clarke said the PCSP is committed to improving road safety across the district and will continue to work with local communities and local police to make this happen.The Mournes councillor also welcomed the provision of a speed sign at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan which is a main link to a number of towns and villages and carries a high volume of traffic.Welcoming the presence of a new speed sign at the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh, Cllr Walker said that he hopes drivers get the message and slow down.ldquoMany people walk along this particular road and it is vital that everything is done to keep them safe. I hope that thew new sign will act as a deterrent and drivers will ease off the accelerator, he continued.He added: ldquoThe PCSP deserves credit for listening to the concerns of elected representatives and the wider public on the speeding issue. The message must go out that speeders are placing their lives and those of other road users in danger. My appeal to all drivers is to obey the restrictions in place and drive below the permitted level in built-up areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Customers and owners delighted pubs re open  ","story":"PUBLICANS across the district have reported a positiveto opening their doors for the first time since the Covid- lockdown.Bars and restaurants were permitted to open for business last Friday by the Stormont Executive under strict conditions.Customers were only allowed indoors provided they were dining and and non-diners who permitted to drink outside, both socially distanced to m between people.After nearly four months of closure, the reopening was welcomed by publicans and customers alike.Despite being hampered by heavy rain throughout the weekend, publicans reported a generally positive reception by customers experiencing the lsquonew normalrsquo way of socialising.However, several publicans claimed that full compliance to all the drinking regulations was patchy in some towns throughout the district.Stephen Magorrian, owner of Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn in Downpatrick, said while numbers of drinkers and diners were less than normal over the weekend, his customers appreciated the social distancing precautions and measures his team had put in place.ldquoWhile it was probably quieter than I would have liked inside for dining, it was very well received by all our customers who were appreciative of how we had trained our staff and the measures we had in place, said Mr Magorrian.ldquoWe had a lot of very positive comments from customers as they left which we are taking as a good sign.ldquoLast weekend was really about making people feel safe in the hope that they will feel safe for customers and staff and be happy toand word will spread that we are taking their safety seriously.He added that while his team had planned how to cope with larger than expected turnout of customers by hiring a door supervisor, ldquosome other bars really went for it, like it was St Patrickrsquos Day.ldquoWe had no issues with any of our customers who were drinking outside and we were happy to welcome them back.Jack OrsquoHare, owner of OrsquoHarersquos in Newcastle, said he had enjoyed a ldquobusy weekend.ldquoCustomers were delighted to be back and so were our staff.

He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work and needs financial help.Mr Gardiner also said the railway is likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid- and the specic challenges the organisation faces with its trains, infrastructure and operations.ldquoWith no income for the rest of the year, we will face major challenges keeping the railway maintained and ensuring our vital work on our carriages, locomotives, track and stations can continue, he explained.ldquoOur final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont have failed, so now we reluctantly must turn to our members and supporters to ask for help. We need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.Mr Gardiner said he could not see now to resume train operations this year in a way that will be safe and, at the same time, not compound the organisationrsquos financial situation by operating trains at a loss.Mr Gardiner said the railway supported the governmentrsquos call for a total lockdown of activities in the fight against Covid-.Even so, he said the lockdown had a ldquomassive hit hit on the railwayrsquos finances, leaving it struggling to keep ready to reopen when it is safe to do so.ldquoWe have just under pound, of bills to pay this year in essential, unavoidable costs alone, to keep the business in mothballs, Mr Gardiner revealed.ldquoWe have been paying these through our savings which were built up over the past few years but were meant for long-awaited essential maintenance, critical repair and restoration work to safeguard the railwayrsquos long term future.ldquoWe have watched as heritage railways across the UK and Ireland launched fundraising campaigns but, at a time when people were worried about basics such as paying their bills, buying groceries and had worries about their jobs and the health of their families, we felt that it just wasnrsquot right to ask for money for a steam railway, so we tried many other avenues of funding.ldquoOur final hope for funding from Stormont was an application for pound, to the Covid- Charities Fund to cover the day-to-day essential costs we have already accrued to date, but we learnt within days of the application being made that it had been rejected.ldquoThis was our last chance with the government schemes as we did not qualy for funding under either the pound, or pound, business support schemes, designed specically for the tourism and hospitality industry as our rateable value was pound, over the pound, threshold. We were also not eligible for the Micro Business Hardship Fund, the Sports and Clubs or voluntary and community sector hardship funds.The chairman continued: ldquoIn short, we have been rejected for support every time because we were too small, too large, or missing a financial threshold by only a few pounds.ldquoSometimes we miss out because we have a small cash reserve for those vital projects, a reserve which is also made up of legacy donations from benefactors who have passed away and wished their donations to go to landmark projects rather than pay day-to-day bills.Mr Gardiner said the heritage railwayrsquos only public funding was what he described as a ldquomodest grant from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and that a question mark hung over this yearrsquos funding.He added: ldquoWe must thank those MLAs, councillors and public representatives who have lobbied and argued our case, even mentioning us in correspondence with NI Executive ministers as an example of an organisation that appears to have fallen through the cracks.ldquoMany of us within the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway feel deep disappointment and frustration, as it feels like every door we try to open is either locked or closed on us. It also feels like, as a business, we are being penalised for good financial governance.Anyone interested in making a financial donation is asked to visit the heritage railwayrsquos website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Hopes for restoration of Shrigley clock for its 150th anniversary  ","story":"DETAILS of fresh efforts to restore a historic clock which was once the centrepiece of village le in Shrigley have been unveiled.The iconic Martin Memorial clock, which had its bell and interior mechanism removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, celebrates its th anniversary next year.To mark the occasion, Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews is hoping that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Housing Executive will join forces to help put the tick back in the famous clock.He says it is sad to see the historic landmark falling into disrepair and hopes efforts to restore it will be successful to preserve it for generations to come.Designed in  by Timothy Hevey, the clock is constructed of brown stone in three layers, with the base surrounded by iron railings. Originally, there was an elaborate lamp at each corner and also a drinking fountain.While there have been ious meetings over many years to discuss the restoration of the clock, nothing ever happened, something Cllr Andrews hopes that he can help put right.He says while money is tight for many organisations which had to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, he hopes the local council and housing officials will commit to helping restore the famous clock to provide a reminder to current generations of Shrigleyrsquos industrial past.The village was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.It was powered by water from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill has long gone mdash it is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Cllr Andrews believes that residents in Shrigley, Killyleagh and further afield would like to see the clock restored to its former glory and hopes he can secure agreement in principle for this to happen.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the clock to deteriorate further, he declared. ldquoIt is an integral part of Shrigleyrsquos history and it must be preserved.ldquoIn the past it was suggested that a community garden could be developed alongside the clock and perhaps that is something worth pursuing.ldquoI think it is incumbent upon those who can help restore the clock to step forward and perhaps the restoration project is something that the Department for Communities could also lend its support to, given the clockrsquos historic link with the former mill located nearby.Cllr Andrews said that identying funds to finance any restoration work was vital in moving forward, also highlighting the need for an agreed plan to maintain the clock.ldquoThe Martin Memorial clock is at the heart of Shrigleyrsquos history and culture and it must not be lost. It must be preserved and those who can help achieve this must come forward, he continued.ldquoGiven its history, a restored clock could become an attraction for visitors and people researching the arearsquos past.ldquoI hope that I can help harness interest and willingness in number of agencies to weigh in behind a successful regeneration project in the heart of Shrigley.

It turned out it was a good deion!Our motto for the walk, lsquoBe Amazed!rsquo, was inspired by Patrickrsquos Confession in which he recounts his journey to Ireland as a fth century slave before being freed spiritually and physically by God. To be honest I was amazed all seven wanted to do the whole Downpatrick Camino in one day as, for many people, I would recommend two half days. It is not for the faint-hearted!Welcoming everyone, I pointed out the finish time was between pm and pm and the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, kindly turned up to bless us on our way, leading us in the pilgrim prayer, which is found in the new pilgrim passport.ldquoI arise today through Godrsquos strength to pilot me, Godrsquos might to uphold mehellipThe newly produced Pilgrim Passport was to stamped at each point along the way: Saint Patrick Centre, Inch Abbey, Saul Church, Slieve Patrick, Struell Wells, St Patrickrsquos Memorial Church, Downpatrick and St Patrickrsquos Grave.ldquoA wing and a prayer, was how one pilgrim put it.Our journey would usually begin at the Saint Patrick Centrersquos IMAX film which explores the story of Patrick but due to lockdown restrictions we skipped this part and, instead, there was a quick photo-call with the new high viz jackets, sponsored by Phoenix Gas.It was an eclectic group: the aptly-named Hillary who had climbed Tanzaniarsquos Kilimanjaro and another, a journalist, who planned to write about the Way a mother and son with strong links to Downpatrick a married couple, Jim and Marion, from Belfast, who were around retirement age and had walked the Camino de Santiago in Spain and finally their friend, Colette, a casual walker blessed with great faith, a sharp wit and, I recall, a fancy gadget that calculated distance.We set out, climbing St Patrickrsquos Staircase and were headed towards Down Museum when a pilgrim asked me about the building behind us.That panicky feeling from school days when my teacher asked an unexpected question began to rise. My credibility as a guide was at stake. Thankfully I had looked up the school out of curiosity the night before. ldquoOh yes, that school was built about  years ago by the Southwell familyhellipIt seemed to get easier after that as we walked towards the Mound of Down to hear about John de Courcy before marching through the fields towards Inch. We would have to take the Belfast Road, as my dream of having a bridge, or a boat, to cross the Quoile was still a dream.At least the grass was freshly cut and the weather was dry. The Lord was good to us.During the tour at Inch Abbey we met a local man, Roger, who kindly pointed out some little known facts and features including the early ldquospa hot-tub where the monkrsquos infirmary had once stood on the banks of the Quoile.After a break, we set off for the banks of the Quoile River and Saul Hill, the group happily chatting to one another after a lockdown of three and a half months. The Quoile is a gentle part of the walk and as the river flowed, ducklings were paddling behind their mother, like pilgrims on the Way.The Mearne Road was a bit more challenging as the way got steeper but we knew Patrick himself had made this climb on his route to founding the first church on the island. Before long we could see the round tower and had made it in good time, around :pm. A trinity was there to greet us mdash the Centre Director Dr Tim Campbell, pilgrim guide Elaine Kelly and the Dean of Down, who recounted the history of Saul Church.When we arrived at The Barn at Saul, just yards away, we were all ready for the pilgrim welcome, the pilgrim washroom and the pilgrim lunch mdash soup and sandwiches, tea and coffee with carefully observed social distancing.They were a happy bunch as I bade them farewell and offered a lt back to anyone who wanted it. But all agreed they wanted to continue with Elaine to Slieve Patrick and then on to Struell Wells via the Lecale path, what I had dubbed the Way of Tranquility until I fell flat on my face in the mud, going over a stile the week before.Hours later, back at the centre, we waited for the pilgrims to . Around pm a message came through that the mother and son had to leave for an appointment and one of the walkers had hit her wall just before the ancient ones at Struell Wells. I put the kettle on and was relieved to see Colette, the walker from Ballymurphy, coming towards the centre, half an hour later.She was exhausted but in good humour as she regaled us with her observations, including the need for a toilet at Struell Wells. ldquoPilgrimrsquos Pain, she declared, and jokedthat she had less suffering during the Troubles in Ballymurphy.Slumped in her chair with her tea at the St Patrickrsquos Centre, having completed % of the walk, she insisted that the Way was way more than  miles . She referred to a fancy gadget ndash which actually turned out to be accurate. Our five-mile estimate for the morning was closer to six miles and the afternoon closer to ten. So a sweet  miles altogether. What would the other pilgrims say when they got back Like an expectant mother and father, Dr Tim Campbell and I waited. I was looking at my watch and nervously flicking at the kettle switch until we caught the reflection of the high-vis jackets in one of the shop windows. Teas were hurried made as the pilgrims, led by Elaine, looking like Rocky Balboa, triumphantly made their way towards the centre.ldquoIt was an amazing experience, declared the journalist who later said he had the energy to walk his love and woke up feeling refreshed. He loved it! Hillaryrsquos boots which had mounted Kilimanjaro started to fall apart on Slieve Patrick but she was rejoicing.The husband and we team from Belfast  ldquoAstounding, exclaimed Marion, joyfully, exhausted but glad to have made it. ldquoYou just need to tell people itrsquos longer, said her husband, Jim.The next dayrsquos pilgrimage, with a few adjustments, had everyone back at .pm.And Elaine and I received some lovely messages including one from Colette, graciously thanking us. ldquoWalking with you on St Patrickrsquos Way.

But outbreaks around the world, particularly in America, show that it could easily , and wreak havoc.While it was deplorable that  people were seen at one Belfast location, clearly ignoring social distancing, in the same way that some of the bonfire breaches on Saturday night were deplorable, it is important to emphasise the scale of what was achieved.Normally a July  brings hundreds of thousands of people out to take part or to watch. The disgraceful calculated social distancing breach at the Bobby Storey funeral, with Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister not only at the helm of it, but truculent and unapologetic since, despite having drawn up strict guidelines that stopped other people mourning, could have caused people to rebel in large numbers on the Twelfth. That would have been understandable, but quite wrong.And it didn’t happen. Instead, across Northern Ireland, people watched from their gardens or footpaths, as the loyal orders and politicians had urged them to, in an inventive and safe response to this year’s unique festivities.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

risk to their staff and to the customers who visit their stores.ldquoOur focus continues to be on the health risks of the outbreak, but we can now begin to cautiously focus much more squarely on the wider economic and societal impact the virus is having.ldquoWe have provided a huge amount of support to businesses and jobs as they hibernated during the pandemic ndash now we start to take these

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityStarting on July , those going shopping need to have their nose and mouth covered or risk a pound fine.This comes after rules requiring people to wear face coverings on public transport became mandatory last month.Initially many experts and authorities, including the World Health Organisation , suggested face coverings were not effective in preventing the spread of coronavirus but are now recommending wearing them in indoor spaces.ndash So, has the science evolved on face coverings A report recently published by the Royal Society suggests that even basic homemade face coverings can reduce transmissionenough people wear them when in public.The study, based on mathematical modelling, showed thatan entire population wore face coverings that were only % effective, it would bring the R value, which is the number of people an infected inidual passes the virus on to, from . to under ., without the need for lockdowns.Meanwhile, another study which looked at coronavirus deaths across  countries found that nations which had policies favouring mask-wearing had lower death rates.In another piece of scientic research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last month, scientists calculated that wearing face coverings prevented more than , infections in Italy between April  and May , and more than , infections in New York City between April  and May .Dr Julian Tang, who is an associate professor of respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, said wearing face coverings in public places could keep the R value below  by creating an ldquoarticial herd immunity. vw,vw,px, px\"He said: ldquoIf you look at other countries outside of the UK ndash such as Japan or Hong Kong ndash they have much higher masking percentages and are way below the epidemic curves of the West.But Dr Simon Clarke, an associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said that while face coverings may reduce the spread of cough droplets, robust epidemiological evidence on their benefits is still lacking.He told the PA news agency: ldquoYou can see that theyare mechanistically obvious but that is not borne out by what actually happens.ldquoWhat is really important is that you have the right mask, fitted properly and changed regularly.ndash Are there any benefits to wearing them Experts say the risk of coronavirus transmission appears to be higher in poorly ventilated indoor spaces and wearing face coverings in small shops or enclosed shopping centres could help reduce the spread.Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said: ldquoLack of strong evidence of their effectiveness should not be considered a problem but the evidence is accumulating that they have a part to play in reducing transmission and also in protecting the wearer.In addition, there is also increased evidence which suggests that many people with the virus who do not have symptoms can still be contagious.Prof Neal told PA that while the evidence of the upsides of wearing face coverings is ldquosupportive rather than definitive, he adds that ldquoit is the asymptomatic or the pre-symptomatic people where the mask has most benefit at the public health level.Meanwhile a report, published last month by the University of Oxfordrsquos Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, noted: ldquoNext to hand washing and social distancing, face masks and coverings are one of the most widely adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions for reducing the transmission of respiratory infections.ndash What does this mean for those looking to go back to the office Experts say wearing face coverings could provide an added line of defence amid growing evidence of airborne transmission of coronavirus.Airborne transmission involves tiny virus-containing droplets, less than five microns in diameter, suspended in the airthat linger for some time.Dr Tang said: ldquoIn the office, it may not be possible to maintain social distancing, you canrsquot always open the windows and ventilation is probably very nominal. So wearing a mask gives an extra layer of protection.ldquoIf half the people in the office wear a mask, it would increase articial herd immunity to around %, which can reduce transmission overall within the office, just by reducing the number of people who are susceptible.ndash Are there downsides to face coverings There are many indoor spaces, such as pubs and restaurants, where the use of face coverings may not be possible.Dr David Strain, clinical senior lecturer at the University of Exeter, said: ldquoIn these locations, strict physical distancing of more than two metres and or physical barriers should be used in order to protect the staff and other customers from the risk of asymptomatic carriers.He added that for those who will be disadvantaged by a mandate to wear face coverings, such as those who rely on lip-reading, alternatives include ldquomoving to the safer distance of two metres and removing the mask in order to facilitate communication, or the use of masks with a clear .Some experts have also shared concerns that wearing face coverings may give the wearer a  sense of security, although Prof Neal said there is ldquono evidence to suggest that is the case.ndash Are some face coverings better than others mdash University of OxfordJuly , The WHO advises a three-layer face covering in the community ndash the outer layer should be water resistant, the inner should be water absorbent and the mid-layer acts as a filter.It emphasises that a face covering alone cannot protect people from Covid-, and must be combined with social distancing of at least a metre and regular hand washing.The Government has said coverings can be made from scarves, bandanas or other fabric items, as long as they cover the mouth and nose.But scientists at the Leverhulme Centre, who studied dferent types of face coverings used by members of the public, say some coverings are not as effective as others, with loosely woven fabrics, such as scarves, shown to be the least effective.Professor Melinda Mills, director of the Leverhulme Centre, said: ldquoAttention must also be placed on how well it fits on the face it should loop around the ears or around the back of the neck for better coverage.She added: ldquoWe find that masks made from high-quality material such as high-grade cotton, multiple layers and particularly hybrid constructions are effective.ldquoFor instance, combining cotton and silk or flannel provide over % filtration, so wearing a mask can protect others..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Do face coverings help reduce coronavirus transmission  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acefefcfaebae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cafdacefbdceeef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_3132859.jpg--.jpg?1589969356000\\","title":"castlederg security alert ends ","story":"A security alert at Millbrook Gardens in Castlederg has ended, and a suspicious object which was examined at the scene, declared a hoax.
