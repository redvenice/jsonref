File photograph: Nick BradshawThe Wars have been a catastrophe for every generation and the “rise of the bellicose language of militarism must end”, President Michael D Higgins has said. Speaking on Saturday at East Mountain in Howth, Co Dublin, where he formally unveiled the restored “Eire 6” sign, which he said proclaimed Irish neutrality in the second World War, Mr Higgins said: “I think there is a special role for people and countries who embrace neutrality to be active in making the case for diplomacy to the very end.”Referring to the war in Ukraine, Mr Higgins paid tribute to “the brave Ukrainian people who are struggling to defend their homes and their people”. He said it had been “unthinkable” to many “that Europe could find itself once again embroiled in war again in the 21st century”.The President said that “we must always exert all of our efforts to avoid war and armed conflict and we must relentlessly pursue a diplomatic approach and particularly involving the multilateral institutions, if we are to avoid bloodshed”. He told a crowd of several hundred, including Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien, TDs Richard Bruton and Seán Haughey, and actor Brendan Gleeson: “We must seize every glimmer of hope for diplomacy to demand and seek access to civilians in need.” Mr Higgins said that “these times are a time when diplomacy is tested”. Thanking the local Howth Eire 6 Restoration Group for restoring the Eire 6 sign carefully and in line with rules surrounding Howth Head’s “important” ecological protections , Mr Higgins said the sign would serve as a reminder to all of the wars in Europe. Noting the sign would be visible to aircraft landing in Dublin, he said it was “an act of positive neutrality” and served “as a reminder of the horrors of war, the unnecessary destruction and waste of human potential”. “So let us exert all our collective efforts to bring an end to war in the Ukraine so that we can return to living in a Europe and in a world that is free from war,” he said.Mr Higgins said Irish citizens valued peace and understood the “misery of war”. Navigational aidThe Eire 6 sign was one of 83 such signs, made up of stone, that were put in place around the State’s coast during the second World War to alert aircraft crews to the fact that they were in Irish airspace, the airspace of a neutral country. Also speaking at the ceremony on Saturday, historian Dr Michael Kennedy said the signs, being numbered, were of significant navigational aid to US planes coming across the Atlantic and of use to British planes heading for Northern Ireland. The Eire 6 sign had been located a few hundred yards from the Howth Look Out Post that was occupied during the second World War by members of the Defence Forces’ Coast Watching Service. However, the sign became overrun by vegetation following the second World War and was not rediscovered until a gorse fire in the early 1980s. Similar signs, including Eire 7 at Dalkey on the other side of the bay, have been uncovered and restored in recent years. After Mr Higgins’s address, the air force staged a flypast as a flotilla including the RNLI and Coast Guard tooted their horns.

That is the response by a child from Edinburgh when asked about sharing too much personal information online.Others see content that promotes self-harm and suicidal thoughts without searching for it. Another is sent inappropriate adverts when playing online games.This is the backdrop to the introduction of our Children’s Code, a crucial piece of work to make sure that children can safely use online services.The code came into force in the UK last year and it is already prompting tech companies to make changes to better protect children.But we knew from the moment that we started drafting our code that its value in keeping children safe would depend on how the code was received internationally.The digital world is borderless, and so many of the online services children access are based outside of the UK. That is one of the reasons why I’m heading to Washington this week for the biggest international gathering to help protect people’s personal information.The more other countries require companies to protect children’s data, the more children in the UK are protected.And the UK has an opportunity to influence real change based on the world-leading code that we have developed.We’ve seen rapid changes in how British children are protected online following the expectations set in our code.Targeted and personalised adverts are being blocked for children children’s accounts set to private by default, plus location history turned off by default. Games and video streaming have geolocation unavailable or off by default. Social media platforms have security measures in place to reduce risks to children.These are some of the types of changes we want to see on a global scale.And there’s more to be done to assess the correct ages of children, give them privacy notices they understand, and to stop the creation of profiles using their personal data.In Washington, the Information Commissioner’s Office will be talking to social media companies in scope of the code and building relationships with the regulators, civil society voices and lawmakers that collectively push for them to do better.We’re calling for our code to be used as a worldwide model for regulation – to move beyond protecting children from the digital world, but instead to protect them within it by ensuring that online services are better designed with children in mind.Our Children’s Code can be the best practice, bringing benefits to children and businesses globally.We know that others are already taking notice. Two years ago, the Information Commissioner’s Office went to San Francisco, to speak with lawmakers, in order to encourage them to be inspired by our code.We are pleased to see that California is now looking to introduce a children’s code of its own – the California Age Appropriate Design Code bill has its first reading in the California Assembly on 19 April. There has been progress, too, in the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Canada and Australia.President Joe Biden talked of protecting children in his recent State of the Union address, saying that “while technology platforms have improved our lives in some ways, there is mounting evidence that social media is harmful to many kids’ and teens’ mental health, well-being, and development.”And American Senators are urging the big tech companies to extend the standards and protections in the UK Children’s Code to children in the United States who use their services.We want to continue to support change that protects children in the UK.The Information Commissioner’s Office has always played an influential role in international data protection, both as a regulator of a large economy and as a key voice in international privacy discussions. Data protection works behind the scenes influencing trade deals, civil liberties and confidence in fair elections.Post-Brexit, we can be more fleet of foot, showcasing the UK as a beacon for innovation and business growth alongside a high level of protection for people’s rights.As the Information Commissioner’s Office regulates all companies operating in the UK or targeting UK residents, wherever they are in the world, the Children’s Code demonstrates the opportunities we have to lead changes internationally that bring real benefits for the UK.Our work in Washington and beyond has never been more important.John Edwards is the UK Information Commissioner More from NewsImran Khan removed as Pakistan\u0026#39s prime minister after losing vote of confidenceExclusive: Full-scale Nato military force to defend bordersJens Stoltenberg: We need a beefed-up Nato to face down threats to European securityForeign countries ‘should adopt British rules’ to keep children safe onlineChildren\u0026#39s early development at risk as Covid still hampers vital NHS servicesRishi Sunak urged to disclose private investments, amid warnings over his role as ChancellorMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"call arms gardeners plant roses thorny perceptions leave flower","story":"Despite the spring season being upon us it appears it’s not looking so rosy in Britain’s gardens.Sales of home-grown rose plants are estimated to have declined from 65 million a year in the 1960s to just five million last year as young people consider the bloom to be “old-fashioned and twee”.Now, in a desperate bid to revive the rose, a new campaign has been launched to convince the new generation of lockdown gardeners that the flower does not require months of toil but can actually create “instant gardens”.Experts are also eager to debunk the myth that roses need intensive pruning and constant spraying to keep pests at bay.The campaign, which is being championed by TV\u0027s David Domoney, will use the Royal Horticultural Society Chelsea Flower Show in May for a formal “call to arms” for consumers, growers and breeders to champion the beleaguered rose.The message will be that modern hybrids are easy to grow, resistant to diseases like black spot and mildew, do not require harmful fungicide sprays and can be planted in hedging, borders, beds, on patios, balconies, as climbers or in a vegetable plot.And while bright reds and pinks have been traditional favourite colours, nowadays glorious apricots, yellows and golds are increasingly popular.Mr Domoney, from ITV’s Love Your Weekend, said: “I’m passionate about roses and there has been a massive love of roses in Britain throughout our history, but roses are vanishing from our public parks and gardens and people are taking roses for granted.“Young people see them as old-fashioned and rather twee and what their grandparents grew.“So it’s time we stood up for the rose and appreciate its versatility - its beauty, use in perfumes, health treatments and even in food.”A social media campaign will showcase roses in all forms and spaces with Mr Domoney offering growing tips.Video footage will also show how he transforms a 20mx20m plot at his home to create a traditional Regency style tea garden with a fountain, parterre and pergola.Some 5,000 rose plants have already been sent out to community gardens across the country and images are also to be posted as part of the campaign. The plan is to give away a further 100,000 over the next 10 years.Among the rose varieties being featured in the campaign are the Chandos Beauty, Lady Marmalade, Sweet Syrie, Easy Does It and Raspberry Royale.David White, the managing director of Harkness Roses which is also supporting the campaign, said: “When I was a boy, roses were seen in public parks and gardens everywhere, but over the years their reputation has gone down as people think they are too difficult to grow and you have to go on a three-day pruning course to look after them.“But the new varieties are so easy to grow. Young gardeners don’t want to spend months tending their garden, they just want an instant garden that can be an outdoor room to their home and roses are ideal and great value. A typical plant costs £15 that will give 100 flowers a year for 15 years which works out at 1p a flower.“We want to galvanise all growers and breeders to revive the rose.”Chris Warner, of Warner’s Roses and Rose Society, added: “For too long roses have been perceived as a problem and this campaign is just what we need to inform people that roses have changed.“Old varieties requiring fungicide sprays gave roses a bad name. Now we need to show off our roses in railway stations, airports, everywhere so people can see the beauty, colour, drama and impact of roses.”More from NewsImran Khan removed as Pakistan\u0026#39s prime minister after losing vote of confidenceExclusive: Full-scale Nato military force to defend bordersJens Stoltenberg: We need a beefed-up Nato to face down threats to European securityForeign countries ‘should adopt British rules’ to keep children safe onlineChildren\u0026#39s early development at risk as Covid still hampers vital NHS servicesBritain can inspire the world to make the internet much safer for our childrenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive full scale nato military force defend borders","story":"Nato is drawing up plans to deploy a permanent full-scale military force on its border in an effort to combat future Russian aggression following the invasion of Ukraine, the alliance’s secretary general has revealed.In an interview with The ­, Jens Stoltenberg said Nato was “in the midst of a very fundamental transformation” that will reflect “the long-term consequences” of Vladimir Putin’s actions.As part of a major “reset”, the relatively small “tripwire” presence on the alliance’s eastern flank will be replaced with sufficient forces to repel an attempted invasion of member states such as Estonia and Latvia. Options for the reset are being developed by Nato military commanders.The disclosure came as Boris Johnson made an unexpected visit to Kyiv to hold talks with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president. The Prime Minister used the visit, which was planned in secrecy, to announce that Britain was sending anti-ship missiles and 120 armoured vehicles in the latest batch of military assistance.On Saturday night, Mr Johnson said: “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century.”In a joint television appearance with Mr Zelensky, he added: “I think that the Ukrainians have shown the courage of a lion, and you Volodymyr have given the roar of that lion. “Having been here in Kyiv for just a few hours, I have no doubt at all that an independent sovereign Ukraine will rise again thanks above all to the heroism, the courage of the people of Ukraine.”Only half a dozen Downing Street staff are understood to have known about Mr Johnson’s visit before the Ukrainian embassy tweeted a picture of the Prime Minister holding talks with Mr Zelensky – such was the level of secrecy adopted for security reasons.Mr Stoltenberg urged other countries to emulate Britain’s support for Ukraine, as he signalled agreement with Mr Zelensky’s view that nations such as Germany were making a false distinction between “defensive” weapons they were willing to supply to Kyiv, and “offensive” weapons that they see as a red line.He also revealed that the threat from China would be enshrined into Nato’s “strategic concept”, its formal strategy document, for the first time, as Beijing and Moscow appeared to be “working more and more closely together”.Amid pressure by some Conservative MPs and ministers for increased defence spending in the UK, Mr Stoltenberg said that he would “welcome” more military expenditure from Britain. But his focus was on ensuring other Nato allies met the alliance’s minimum requirement of 2 per cent expenditure as a share of their GDP.Setting out plans for the “reset” of Nato, Mr Stoltenberg pointed out that it now already had 40,000 troops under its direct command in the eastern part of the alliance – nearly 10 times the number it had a few months before the invasion. But he added: “What we see now is a new reality, a new normal for European security. Therefore, we have now asked our military commanders to provide options for what we call a reset, a longer-term adaptation of Nato. I expect that Nato leaders will make decisions on this when they meet in Madrid at the Nato summit in June.”Before Feb 24, Nato’s presence on its eastern border with Russia amounted to a so-called “tripwire” force, which was intended to signal the alliance’s intent to defend itself from an attack.In the event of an attack on countries such as Latvia and Estonia, which border Russia, reinforcements would have been called in from across the alliance. But now Nato is preparing to have a permanent presence on its eastern flank of a scale that could itself defend the alliance against a Russian attack. Last month Britain said it would double its troops in Eastern Europe and send a new deployment to Bulgaria, when Nato leaders agreed to further strengthen the alliance’s eastern flank against Russian aggression. But Mr Stoltenberg’s remarks reveal that the alliance is preparing to go further still.Appearing to reject the claim by some countries that “offensive” weapons should not be provided to Ukraine for fear of provoking Russia, Mr Stoltenberg said: “Everything Ukraine does with different types of weapons is defensive, it is about defending themselves against the atrocities, against the invasion, against a brutal use of military force against their own country.”As well as the additional military ­support for Ukraine, Mr Johnson said the UK would guarantee an additional $500 million (£385 million) in World Bank lending to the country, taking Britain’s total loan guarantee to $1 billion.More from NewsImran Khan removed as Pakistan\u0026#39s prime minister after losing vote of confidenceJens Stoltenberg: We need a beefed-up Nato to face down threats to European securityForeign countries ‘should adopt British rules’ to keep children safe onlineChildren\u0026#39s early development at risk as Covid still hampers vital NHS servicesBritain can inspire the world to make the internet much safer for our childrenRishi Sunak urged to disclose private investments, amid warnings over his role as ChancellorMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"foreign countries should adopt british rules keep children safe","story":"Children will only be safe in a borderless digital world if other countries adopt the UK\u0027s children\u0027s code, the information watchdog has warned.John Edwards, the information commissioner, will use a global summit this week to urge international watchdogs and social media firms to adopt the code as a worldwide model for regulation.Setting out his vision exclusively in The  ahead of the summit, Mr Edwards said it was only through other countries toughening their laws that British children would be protected when they used online services based outside the UK.The code would place a legal duty of care on companies in whatever jurisdiction they operate to protect children online with default settings and safety measures designed to guarantee privacy.Firms failing to comply with the code would face heavy fines and blocks on their services. It would be modelled on internationally agreed data protection laws where financial penalties are generally set at four per cent of global turnover, equivalent to more than £3 billion for a firm such as Facebook.Mr Edwards said California, which hosts the HQs of some of the biggest tech firms in the world, was already introducing a UK-style children’s code, with the bill\u0027s first reading in the state’s assembly on April 19. The Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Canada and Australia are bringing in similar measures.“We’re calling for our code to be used as a worldwide model for regulation,” said Mr Edwards, who will set out his proposals at the International Association of Privacy Professionals summit in Washington.“We knew from the moment we started drafting our code that its value in keeping children safe would depend on how the code was received internationally.“The digital world is borderless, and so many of the online services children access are based outside of the UK.

All political parties now, quite rightly, champion equality. But as far back as 1882 Gladstone’s second administration passed the Married Women’s Property Act, undoing centuries of English common law and a husband controlling the assets of his wife. Now, 140 years later, so-called progressives are attacking the Chancellor for not playing the mid-Victorian paterfamilias, and keeping his wife’s finances under control.The absurdity of attacking Mr Sunak for how his wife, who is not even a British subject, manages her considerable wealth only emphasises the cowardice and stupidity of using her to undermine him: for it should be obvious that he had dug his own political grave quite deeply enough without his enemies weaponising her.Much is awry not just with British economic management, but with the presentation of economic policy, and the buck stops with him. He has helped other parties to challenge the Conservatives’ economic record. More pointedly, he has made it easy for those of his colleagues who wish to stop him from succeeding Boris Johnson to do so. It is seldom wise, if one has prime ministerial ambitions, to be the heir apparent, as any number of beached ex-cabinet ministers will confirm. Mr Sunak, sadly for him, has become the latest.It is not advisable to be Second Lord of the Treasury in an avowedly tax-cutting party at a time when the tax burden is at its highest since the days of Mr Attlee, when we had the Second World War to pay for. It is not good to preside over apparently uncontrollable public spending – pandemic or not – to the point where your colleague, the fraud minister, resigns because you are showing no inclination to tackle £4.3 billion of fraud against the Exchequer caused by Covid loan schemes: never mind £9 billion written off for useless personal protective equipment.But perhaps worst of all – and this seems to have become the main card to be played against the Chancellor – it appears not to be a good idea to be a very rich man with an even richer wife at a time when, it is reported, some people are feeling forced to choose between eating and turning their heating on, and you have just made many of them pay more National Insurance.Being extremely rich should not be a disqualification from holding high political office. However, the Chancellor’s public relations of late have been abominable, especially for one who was formerly so assiduous (perhaps too assiduous) at projecting an attractive public image. If he understands what life is really like for many whom he helps govern then he makes a poor show of communicating that fact. Notably, a photo opportunity he staged when cutting fuel duty last month served to suggest only his inexperience at filling a car up, leaving others to assume that he has a forelock-tugging man who does that for him.Mrs Sunak’s agreement to pay tax on her overseas earnings in Britain has been reported as a ploy to save her husband’s career. It is probably too late. The Prime Minister, having seen the failure of many ministerial colleagues and backbenchers to support Mr Sunak, may conclude that he could reshuffle him without much harm. With all the talk of the Sunaks’ global property portfolio, and of Mrs Sunak being richer than the Queen, Tory MPs are now openly saying he is too rich to be prime minister. Given what Labour calls “the cost of living crisis” and Mr Sunak’s tactlessness in managing his public image and his policies, they may, regrettably, be right.In a meritocratic party a leader should be chosen according to his or her abilities. Unfortunately for Mr Sunak, however, what has really undone him is that his talents are now being seriously called into question. His family’s fortune, compared with that failing, is a secondary matter.More from NewsImran Khan removed as Pakistan\u0026#39s prime minister after losing vote of confidenceExclusive: Full-scale Nato military force to defend bordersJens Stoltenberg: We need a beefed-up Nato to face down threats to European securityForeign countries ‘should adopt British rules’ to keep children safe onlineChildren\u0026#39s early development at risk as Covid still hampers vital NHS servicesBritain can inspire the world to make the internet much safer for our childrenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stuck macron le pen frances political system disintegrating","story":"Whatever the outcome of France’s presidential vote – and President Macron will probably be reelected – I fear it marks another stage in the dissolution of a political system. Of course, this could be beneficial: we are supposed to welcome change and renewal. It will certainly be interesting: France has often been a political laboratory for Europe, and its people are quite proud of this. But life in a laboratory is not comfortable.The familiar political landmarks that democratic systems depend on have gone. It is astonishing that the candidates of what were until recently modern France’s two ruling parties, the Socialists and (under a variety of names) the Gaullists, have been reduced to insignificance, with their presidential candidates polling at under 10 per cent. Yet France’s previous president was a Socialist, François Hollande, and the Gaullist François Fillon would probably have beaten Macron in 2017 had he not been caught up in a corruption scandal. Now these political pillars of the Fifth Republic system, parties that provided essential popular representation, have almost completely disintegrated. This election could be their coup de grace.Now France is faced solely with alternatives that repel or alarm a large part of its people: Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen. Even at the last election, Macron was the first choice of only a quarter of the electorate. Then he seemed an unobjectionable centrist. Now he is regarded with visceral dislike by a remarkable range of people. Le Pen represents a far-Right tradition that until recently most voters considered beyond the pale: reactionary, racist, and undemocratic. But it has increased its appeal, especially among the young.Whoever becomes the next president will face a discontented and alienated country, and it is unclear how effective government can be possible. A President Le Pen would mean violence in the streets and political and economic crisis. Would she be capable of forming a credible government? Many of those voting for her are so discontented that they are willing to risk pulling the house down. But if he is re-elected Macron might also be faced with popular rebellion, and with a slim prospect of a parliamentary majority to support him.France’s predicament is an extreme form of the political malady rife across the democratic world: rejection of conventional politics, reduced party loyalty and membership, low turnout in elections, unpredictable and volatile voting choices. This has given politicians standing in opposition to “mainstream politics” – or claiming that they were – an opportunity in several countries.They are conventionally dismissed as “populists”. Le Pen of course is one of these. So is her far-Left equivalent, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. But Macron himself was the arch-populist, campaigning in 2017 against conventional politics, rejecting existing parties and creating his own movement drawn from civil society bodies and non-politicians. This respectable bourgeois populism has a label: “technopopulism”. It claims legitimacy from a superior ability to manage the system, in Macron’s case as would-be leader of a more powerful technocratic EU. His victory sounded the death knell of the old party system.Does this matter? Yes, if nothing replaces it which can perform the minimum functions of democratic parties: to assemble majorities, or at least large coherent minorities, to bring forward (and get rid of) political leaders, to formulate programmes and try to carry them out if elected, to give people a means of participating and being represented, and to maintain a sense of legitimacy. No system does this perfectly indeed, looking round the world we can see how poorly many democracies are working, including the most established. But in a system stuck between Macron and Le Pen, the problem is acute.Does history explain this? Clearly yes. Political systems are invariably created in times of crisis, and are very difficult to change thereafter. France’s present 1958 constitution, which its drafter aptly called a “republican monarchy”, was adopted to enable Charles de Gaulle to master the incipient civil war over Algeria, and to establish a powerful and even authoritarian government as the Fifth Republic.This was the latest variant of the regular fluctuations between authority and democracy that France has experienced since the 1789 revolution. The most recent had been the ultra-reactionary Vichy regime of Marshal Pétain (1940-44), followed by the ultra-parliamentary system of the Fourth Republic (1946-58), criticised as impotent and chaotic. De Gaulle’s system has been plausibly called Bonapartist, which is an attempt to combine both authority and democracy – “active authority, passive democracy”, as one historian has defined it.The Fifth Republic is paradoxical. It has been the most widely accepted and arguably the most successful of the 15 constitutional systems France has had since 1789. Yet it has always been criticised in principle, and has regularly given rise to problems. A cynic might say that it is principles that are France’s problem. Unlike Britain – which, said Disraeli, was not governed by principles but by parliament – the French have regularly chosen, or been forced, to try to design perfect systems. This, Edmund Burke thought, was the original sin of the Revolution, the “fairy land of philosophy”. De Gaulle’s republic deliberately weakened political parties and parliament by concentrating power in the presidency.After 64 years it has succeeded rather too well. Parties are largely the supporters’ clubs of iniduals, based on patronage and personal ties. Le Pen’s party, now called the Rassemblement National, is a 50-year-old family business. Macron started his own from scratch – La République en Marche (now simply EM! complete with exclamation mark). But then de Gaulle, the godfather of the system, also had his own tame party.The overriding aim of the party is to install a president, who is practically irremovable, and whose powers of government and patronage are immense. As a sceptical commentator, Jean-François Revel, wrote some years ago, this was an instrument so open to abuse that it was “criminal to put it even into the hands of a saint”. It was absolutism”, but “ineffective absolutism”. And indeed Macron’s high-handed plans for sweeping reform had to be watered down or dropped after the gilets jaunes revolted and workers came out on strike. But Macron remained. And is likely to remain for another term. To do what?The last two parties standing will be Macron’s EM! and Le Pen’s RN. Their changing and abbreviated titles show how little they exist apart from their leaders. The great mass parties that once bestrode French political life have almost vanished. Yet they possessed not only vast organisations, but whole cultures: there was a “peuple de gauche” with its own sociability, rituals and even tastes (the Left, one survey showed, preferred Camembert).But it is the far Right that is still alive and kicking. It too has its historic cultural core: a mixture of traditional Catholic patriotism, once royalist of French nationalism, resistant to Macron’s flamboyant Europeanism and of suspicion of immigrants. This attracted many former Communists, and now many young voters, embittered by poor job prospects and a system that seems unheeding.It is precisely this Right-wing tradition – long embodied by Jean-Marie Le Pen and tainted by anti-Semitism, anti-republicanism, Algérie Française nostalgia, and a lingering association with Pétainism – which made Le Pen father and daughter unelectable. Most French citizens, whether Socialist or Gaullist, would under no circumstances vote “lepeniste”.This political conundrum – a hard-core tradition that kept lepenism going despite all the reverses, but which at the same time made it unelectable – may be unravelling as the historical burden of the 1940s and 1950s is shrugged off by new generations. I still think that the weight of history means that Le Pen will be beaten even by Macron. But no longer by a landslide.  Then there is likely to be some sort of political turmoil that may bring new alliances and perhaps more ephemeral parties into existence. But the wish expressed by generations of French politicians since the early 19th century that France might develop a stable system of respectable moderate parties like the American and the British that could offer credible alternatives seems less than ever likely, not least because the Anglo-Saxon model is now uninspiring.So whoever becomes the next President, the likelihood is of a remote and unpopular incumbent, unable to unite the country, unable to carry out a programme, but solidly ensconced in the Elysée Palace. Whether Macron or Le Pen, the dangerous instrument will not be in the hands of a saint.  Robert Tombs is professor emeritus of French history at the University of CambridgeMore from NewsImran Khan removed as Pakistan\u0026#39s prime minister after losing vote of confidenceExclusive: Full-scale Nato military force to defend bordersJens Stoltenberg: We need a beefed-up Nato to face down threats to European securityForeign countries ‘should adopt British rules’ to keep children safe onlineChildren\u0026#39s early development at risk as Covid still hampers vital NHS servicesBritain can inspire the world to make the internet much safer for our childrenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"angela rayner tories blame frightening","story":"Tories are to blame for frightening cost of living crisis, not RussiaAngela Rayner, Labour deputy leader, has criticised the Governments decision to hike National Insurance at a time when families are already under strainRenewable energy sources are more self-reliant - but have been too neglected by the Tories, says Angela Rayner Image: Martin Burton SussexLiveopinionByAngela Rayner:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |commentsThe Government’s introduction of a National Insurance hike at a time when families are already struggling to make ends meet is genuinely frightening. We are facing an extraordinary rise in the cost of food and fuel, which is affecting just about everybody – not just people who are on low incomes. To see this steep surge in prices has been devastating... and it’s only going to get worse. We have said time and time again that it is absolutely not the right time to be increasing National Insurance. And it goes directly against promises the Tories made to voters. They are trying to link the energy crisis to the war in Ukraine. But they knew the supply of oil and gas was a problem before. They have tried to blame the National Insurance hike on Covid. But  years of Tory austerity has made things even worse for the health and social care sector and put huge pressure on hospitals and the NHS.  The Tories have created this crisis and to break their promises when they knew this was coming just shows we cannot trust a word they say. They are so out of touch, they don’t even realise that this is the biggest cost-of-living crisis in generations. All the while, we learn that Rishi Sunak’s we uses a loophole scheme to avoid UK tax. I have had so many people contacting me who are absolutely petried that they are not going to be able to afford to live over the next few months. I grew up in poverty and saw the devastating effects this can have first-hand. The shocking thing now compared to when I was growing up, however, is that these are often people in decent jobs who are being forced to go to food banks in order to support themselves. So many of these people suffering, such as nurses and care workers, were told they were lockdown heroes  months ago. Now they feel like they’re being punished and are completely demoralised.  What’s particularly frustrating for me is that the North and the Midlands were promised so-called “levelling up”. But these are the places that are going to be the hardest hit by the crisis. People in constituencies like mine in Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester were promised their bills would go downwe left the European Union – but the opposite has happened. Labour would impose a windfall tax on gas and energy companies. We have done this in the past and we can do it again. There is no reason why we cannot pass this money on to the people who need it the most to ease the cost of living squeeze. This would reduce the average household energy bill by up to £, and we would target support to low earners, pensioners and squeezed families. We also need to ensure a more secure workforce, with a decent living wage and proper employment rights.  The PO scandal has shown us that anyone is vulnerablewe let this stand – and this Government cannot be trusted to step in and stand up for workers. We would also invest in renewable energy, like wind farms, to make us more self-reliant and more secure as a country. It would also bring in skilled workers to areas such as the North and Scotland, where people can get decent jobs to last them a letime. The Government’s response has been woeful and last week’s tax hike is only going to plunge more people into more devastation and debt.

However, Priti Patel is not issuing them with visas quickly enoughBoris Johnson has shown that Britain supports Ukrainian independence Image: POOL AFP via Getty ImagesopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Apr |comments Although Boris Johnson had one eye on a great photo op on his surprise visit to Kyiv today, there is no doubting the genuine friendship between our PM and Volodymyr Zelensky.The Ukrainian president was certainly also grateful for Mr Johnson’s offer of extra British weaponry while there. On the international stage, Mr Johnson has shown Britain to be Ukraine’s staunchest ally, committed to Ukrainian independence and standing by the Ukrainian people in their hour of need. But that story is disturbingly dferent closer to home. What Ukrainian people fleeing war need most is sanctuary, and , big-hearted British families are ready to open their homes to provide it. Yet only , Ukrainian refugees have arrived here so far under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.  That is because Priti Patel is not issuing them with visas quickly enough. The Home Secretary promised Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko she would ensure visas were processed in three days. That was three weeks ago. Ms Vasylenko is an impressive MP. And she is not impressed by Ms Patel’s dilly-dallying. In Kyiv today, Mr Johnson showed President Zelensky the firm hand of friendship. Now the PM needs to take a firm hand with Ms Patel – and tell her thatshe cannot sort out this mess, he will find someone who can.  Grant us a plan There was something depressingly inevitable about Brits who’d been looking forward to their first proper holiday for years spending much of it stuck in traffic jams and airport lounges. Today, chaos reigned on the ground and in the air as people tried to get away for a much-needed Easter break. The port of Dover blamed its delays on the suspension of PO Ferries. Airports said they were plagued by Covid staff absences. And Transport Secretary Grant Shapps wrung his hands and expressed concern, which was about as much use as a flat tyre on the M. PO bosses are to blame for some of this by their summary sacking of  seafarers. We must spare a thought for them and their families. But Mr Shapps knew PO would present a problem this weekend. And Covid should have come as no surprise to him. Labour says better planning could have alleviated some of these delays. And when it comes to travel, Mr Shapps is planner-in-chief. Tea infusiasts You have to be British to appreciate Sue and Keith Blayze’s passion for collecting teapots because where in the world, they would be dubbed crackpots. The couple have spent £, on their collection, which now attracts thousands of visitors a year and even earned royal approval when Prince Charles and Camilla popped in. Which just goes to show that when it comes to hobbies, Sue and Keith have theirs down to a tea.

And he got the snap he wanted. A handshake and grin before getting back on the plane. Job done. Kind of. After all, that’s the optics sorted, PM, now it’s time for action. During his brief stay Mr Johnson pledged, as is his wont, everything that Ukraine needs to survive as a sovereign nation. And he’s promised missiles, rockets, armoured vehicles and new anti-ship weapons systems. That’s a start – these weapons are much needed. They are up against one of the world’s largest and most ruthless armies.  But the battlefield is not the only place where the PM needs to deliver. He also promised visas. He promised that the UK would make the process as easy as possible for desperate refugees. That’s a promise he’s failed to deliver. More accurately, his Home Secretary has failed. Lesia Vasylenko, a Ukrainian MP who took up arms against the Russians, said she was promised visas in three days by Priti Patel – three weeks ago. We’re used to this Government breaking promises. But to renege on a deal made to such desperate people is unforgivable. The joke in the Ukraine is that the visas will land when the war is over. Dark humour but frighteningly close to the bone. Mr Johnson needs to act with the same urgency on this as he did when he sped off to Kyiv. This is not a photo op, not a headline grabber, not an opportunity to spin. It’s about people’s lives. People we promised to help. Time to deliver.  Prove your honour Speaking of promises - it’s time for Prince Andrew to step up. He’s had plenty of chances to prove he remains capable of doing the right thing. He pledged to help victims of sex trafficking as he paid out to his accuser Virginia Giuffre, saying he would atone for his association with Jeffrey Epstein by supporting the fight. Now, victims want him to act.

Removals vans were seen lining up to take furniture and personal items from the flat shared by Mr Sunak and we Akshata Murthy and move them to their newly-refurbished, luxury West London pad. A red velvet armchair, a shelving unit and several bags and boxes were loaded onto two trucks, which arrived at Downing Street’s back gate early on Saturday morning. But the Sunday Mirror understands the move was planned before Mr Sunak’s popularity noseed this week. The family are making the move because their eldest daughter is about to go into her final term of primary school, the Mirror understands. They want to be nearer to her school for the last few months before she goes to boarding school.  Mr Sunak is expected to split his evenings between the Downing Street flat and their Kensington home, but continue to work from Number .Previously a shoe-in to replace Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister, Mr Sunak’s fortunes have been on the wane since last month’s disastrous Spring Statement failed to provide help for families facing a cost of living crisis. This week it was revealed Mrs Murthy enjoyed non-dom tax status - and Mr Sunak had held on to his Green Card as a ‘resident’ of the United Sates for more than a year after becoming Chancellor. It comes amid calls for partners and spouses of ministers to be banned from being non-doms - and avoiding paying tax on money made outside the UK. Labour said Mr Sunak and his family potentially saved tens of millions of pounds in taxes through his weaposs non-dom status. And Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh blasted the chancellor for not being transparent about his family’s tax status. “He has come out on a number of occasions to try and muddy the waters around this and to obfuscate, she said. Mrs Murty announced on Friday that she would voluntarily pay UK taxes on all her worldwide income as she did not want her financial arrangements to be a distraction for her husband. But she will keep her non-dom status, which allows her to take advantage of India’s zero rate of inheritance tax on her family’s multi-million pound business empire. And the SNP called on Mr Sunak to publish his tax s.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the scandal showed the Chancellor and his we lived in a completely dferent universe in financial terms from ordinary people left struggling by the cost-of-living crisis. The Lib Dems have called on the PM to ban the wives and partners of ministers from using the non-dom “loophole”. Lib Dem Treasury Spokesperson Christine Jardine said: “Government ministers have a duty to do what’s morally right. When they change peoples’ taxes, they and their immediate families should play by the same rules as everybody .” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Rishi SunakBoris JohnsonConservative Party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I tend to agree, having lived a semi-itinerant lestyle in the early part of my career.So, pity poor Rishi Sunak, who is shting furniture this weekend.I’m not entirely sure how useful he’ll be – given that he’s a short bloke . Maybe he’ll help pack a side table or two, chest of drawers maybe. But I can’t see him on the other end of a piano, ­especiallythey’re aiming to sht it upstairs.Stressful as relocation is, though, it will be the least of his worries this weekend. Pals are saying that, ­politically, he’s going through a bad time. The worst time, they say – and it’s going to get worse. Earlier this week, the Chancellor lashed out at the political storm around him. It was a hit-job, he said. No need to bring my we into it, he said, I haven’t done anything wrong, he said. Meh. I kind of agree with the first part. There’s a game going on in Westminster at the moment, trying to work out who has put the hex on Mr Sunak. To recap, he’s in some political ­trouble because it has emerged that his we, Akshata Murty, has, to put it mildly, a convoluted tax set-up. The point being, it’s not a massively good look for the Chancellor’s we to have been a non-dom when she’s quite clearly living here. In Downing Street. With the Chancellor. But, you know, I guess that’s just optics. Who’s behind it, how did this news leak out, everyone wants to know  Some people are pointing the finger of blame at Number . Mr Sunak has been billed as a future Prime Minister, a serious leadership rival, and this could well be “the ­machine” taking him out.  There are still some elements in there who are angry with the Chancellor for not backing the PM over Partygate. But that’s probably not right here. Nor is the rumour that the story was whipped up by Labour, although it has not done them any harm at all. In fact, as it rumbles on, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Mr Sunak is an electoral weak spot and a nice target to apply some pressure on. Open goal, really, a millionaire Chancellor married to a woman who had non-dom status, while the rest of us are skint. Open goal, and gives Labour some purchase in an area where they have been outclassed by the Tories over the past decade. Even at the height of austerity, the Tories still managed to frame Labour as weak on the economy. Not this time, not with an easy narrative, and an easy target like this. Anyway. It was probably neither of them. Just some fine journalism that sparked this whole thing. But it’s been seized on, naturally, and the level of mud-slinging will step up over the coming weeks. Mr Sunak is not happy, neither is his inner circle, andhe thinks Number  is behind the briefings, he’ll continue to lash out. Nothing to lose now, I suppose, as it looks like the Chancellor’s leadership hopes are over for now. Isn’t that the Tories all over  There’s already a war raging , miles away.

That is down by , since the , in the week ending  February . Rail services are battling Covid absences and a funding crisis - as there are still only % as many passengers travelling as pre-pandemic, the data shows. Passenger numbers have risen as fast as a million a week, hitting .million weekly journeys in the most recent figures. But this is down from .million weekly journeys pre-pandemic. And despite fares rising .% last month, services are still being cut to save cash. More cuts are planned in Yorkshire next month - leaving a two-hour, ten-minute gap between the .pm and .pm service from Leeds to Harrogate.  Labour, which obtained the leaked Rail Delivery Group data, blasted the figures just months after Tory ministers vowed to “protect and improve services” in the Integrated Rail Plan.Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said: “The Conservatives should come clean and admit they are taking the axe to vital rail services across the country. “This is the exact opposite of what the Conservatives promised, and will hit communities hard. “To add insult to injury, last month they clobbered passengers with another brutal fare hike.” The Rail Delivery Group said it was “only sensible” that services reflect the “new world” of passenger numbers that have “changed radically with the pandemic”, “so that the railway doesn’t take more than its fair share from the taxpayer”. Askedservices would ever get back to what they were in early , a spokesperson said: “Nothing is set in stone and we will continually monitor how passengersand look to step up services where there is enough demand from passengers.”  It comes days after local leaders said they were “shafted” by Boris Johnson’s bus funding which went to fewer than half of eligible areas. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The railways experienced an unprecedented fall in passenger numbers during the pandemic. “Not adjusting rail services would have been irresponsible and unfair on those taxpayers’ forced to foot the bill – many of whom do not use the railways. “Instead, this Government committed almost £bn to ensure vital services continued to run and key workers were able to keep using them. “Whilst passengers are ing, it is important to ensure service levels reflect demand, which is still % less than in , and we will keep working with operators to do so.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyDepartment for TransportBoris JohnsonRailwaysSave moneyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Coastal areas were already suffering hits as even low paid seasonal work dried up with so many holidaymakers jetting off to foreign hotspots instead. Local economies struggled even more as young people moved away to find jobs where. Now think tank the Centre for Progressive Policy has plotted the areas likely to suffer most from this year’s soaring prices. They pinpointed seaside resorts Thanet, Great Yarmouth, Hastings, Tendring, Essex, Torbay and the Isle of Wight - all held by Tory MPs - at particular risk.  Seaports Portsmouth, where one in three jobs are low paid, and Dover - hit by PO’s sudden sacking of  seafarers - are also on the poverty list.The CPP’s Ben Franklin said: “Our analysis suggests the Chancellor may be forced to reconsider a Universal Credit uplt to really help those hit hardest in places like Hartlepool and Hastings.”And shadow Levelling Up Secretary Lisa Nandy added: “This new research reveals the inadequacy of the Government’s response to the cost-of-living crisis facing families. “We need to get money back into people’s pockets.”The CPP used indicators such as existing fuel and food poverty, benefit claimant count, joblessness and low pay to come up with a cost of living vulnerability index. That showed that Thanet has more than one in five residents struggling with food bills, one in ten with fuel, a child poverty rate of % and % not working. A quarter of those in work in Great Yarmouth are on low pay while one in three children live in poverty. But South Thanet Tory MP Craig Mackinlay, which has Kent seaside resorts Broadstairs and Ramsgate in his constituency, was upbeat on the prospects for his patch.  He said: “Going to Spain is going to be a lot more expensive this year. “So tourism here could actually increase what with fuel costs, flight disruption and people getting more used to staycations during the pandemic.” And at least one seaside town has avoided going into decline as the holiday trade disappeared by ersying into other areas.

But critics fear the posts will be offered to ex-town hall officials in a revolving door of failure. The successful candidates – who will receive almost five times the salary of the average council worker – are expected to “live, breathe and champion” the places they represent.

But John O’Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “These pricey pen-pushers will end up costing the very people they’re trying to help a fortune in taxes. The best way to level up is by allowing families and firms to keep more of their own money and giving them more say over how taxes are spent.” The job news comes after it emerged some , council fatcats pocketed more than £, last year. Lisa Nandy, Shadow Levelling Up Secretary, said: “It is vital these directors provide value for money for the taxpayer and understand the communities they are serving. “Levelling Up can’t be about rearranging the deckchairs or more bureaucracy – it’s about good jobs for everyone, money in people’s pockets, and empowering people to make the decisions that affect communities.”Harry Quilter-Pinner, director of the IPPR think-tank, warned against recruiting from the “old guard” oflocal politics and said the Government must instead “reach out to women, people of colour and people from working-class backgrounds”.A government spokesman said: “Directors will be working collaboratively with local leaders across all sectors to drive innovative proposals.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Sunday MirrorLevelling Up Watch,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I donapost even know how I could describe him. Youaposd never get another one. They broke the mould when they made him. He was the best brother you could wish for, the best uncle I could choose for my kids, and the best dad. He was just an amazing person. Mum Sharon last spoke to Tom the Sunday before he died, the same day he last called his brother Ben, who he told heaposd call again later. The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Ben instantly wanted to throw up when he heard what happened to Tom, saying: I felt like I was going to be sick. Itaposs a disgusting feeling.News spread through the family in the following hours before Ben and Neneh travelled to Cambridgeshire, not sure how serious it was during the very tense and nerve-wracking journey to the hospital where Tom lay, his condition on a kneaposs edge.Neneh cried when she walked into Tomaposs room. Benaposs voice broke as he recalled arriving to see his brotheraposs face all squashed up, with tubes going down his throat.He said: Itaposs not the way you want to see someone for the last time, especially not your brother.For two days, Tom was in hospitals undergoing surgery and having his leg amputated.The wait was really traumatic for Neneh, who was preparing herself for Tom not pulling through. Sharon felt sick, like youaposre going to die, as she heard developments. Ben tried to convince himself Tom would survive, saying: Thataposs what I was telling myself, and I was telling everyone he was going to be okay, you know, aposheaposs going to struggle for a while, but heaposs going to be fineapos.  But it became clear Tom wouldnapost make it. His then-one-year-old son, Thomas, lay on his chest when his le support was turned off in Addenbrookeaposs Hospital, Cambridge. Ben held Tomaposs hand, wishing he could take his brotheraposs place as the -year-oldaposs heart stopped on Thursday, September , . Ben said: If it had been the other way around, heaposd have been with me, and I believe that he knew we were there. Neneh is still kind of in denial and angry at the fact that le his le had been taken away. She moved to Wisbech after Tomaposs death to be closer to his son, describing him as a lovely and good kid who Tom would be proud of.Neneh said: Heaposs just like his dad. Heaposs funny, heaposs got the best personality for a two-year-old, heaposs really clever. Heaposs just like his dad in every way. Despite the trace of Tom left in his son, the family is all too aware of the pain Thomas may feel in later le when he learns what happened to his dad. Ben said: [Thomas] has to grow up without a dad. We have to grow up without a brother and a son. Itaposs not right that I have to tell my nephew what his dad was like. I shouldnapost have to do that. Thataposs not something I should have to do. His dad should be with him.He added: Iaposve just got to try and make people always remember him. I could be gone  years and Iaposd still want him to be remembered, like, aposYou had a great-great-uncle named Tom, thataposs why youaposre named Tomapos. Heaposs the strongest person Iaposve ever known, just the way he was. Iaposll never meet anyone like him ever again.

A full investigation has been carried out by our Major Crime Unit and at present we are not actively investigating any lines of enquiry.

And Brits have been united in their despair, reports NorthWalesLive. National Insurance, council tax, and food and fuel prices have all increased due to the crisis, and experts have warned that the spikes wonapost start slowing anytime soon. Those that use smart meters were all under the impression that this would help keep cost down and also under control, as it helps monitor the bills.

The strawberries will be produced in vertically stacked beds indoors, with plants watered using a hydroponic feed. It means the berries will grow in water, without soil, with plants layered on top of each other in a series of tiers. The system, hailed as more eco-friendly than normal methods, uses  per cent less water and reduces global imports. The strawberry season was only six weeks long  years ago, but industry investment has extended this period to up to nine months. Around  per cent of all strawberries now sold in the UK are homegrown. But lack of natural daylight limits the season beyond November.  Lincolnshire based Jones Food Company, which is set to open the world’s biggest indoor vertical growing farm near Lydney, Glos, later this year, is producing the strawberries with UK fruit grower Berry Gardens. The first crop is likely to be in the shops by winter . Latest figures show Britons are buying more fresh strawberries than ever before. Last year we spent £million on them,  per cent up on . Jones Food Company boss and founder James Lloyd-Jones said: “British agriculture has traditionally been limited by seasonality but this collaboration looks to get us to a point where UK consumers can buy fresh homegrown strawberries throughout the winter and year round. “Vertical farming not only benefits the environment but also the economy. Out food supply chain is under signicant stress, rising costs of energy, fertiliser and food are all regular and consistent concerns, so vertical farming is undoubtedly a vital part of the UK’s farming future.” Nick Allen of Berry Gardens, based in Maidstone, Kent, said: “Like most of the industry we are actively looking for ways we can become more sustainable across our business.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The economySunday Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Good food is even more essential when you are unwell. This is barely a step above cardboard with no nutritional value. Others shared their dismay in response to the tweet. One said:  chips and five, erm, whatever those things are that look asyou could bounce them off the wall. Well done Scottish NHS. One Twitter user said: My gran is in at the moment and the food is horrendous.The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is run by NHS Greater Glasgow  Clyde. A spokesperson said: A two-week rotating menu enables patients to choose from a iety of meals based on their personal preferences and also that of their families and carers, ensuring food served is tailored to their needs. If a patient wishes to provide any feedback or is unhappy with their food, we actively encourage them to raise this with us directly through nursing or catering staff, through our online feedback forms, or, via the ‘Food and Health in Hospital’ form given to them as part of their stay. This ensures that we can act quickly to make appropriate changes when required. Unannounced, regular visits to the wards review the quality of food delivered to the patients, helping ensure patients are happy with their meals.In February The Mirror told how hospitals in England were forcing doctors to become ­“Deliveroo Docs” which was creating an unhealthy workforce.The doctors used fast food delivery apps to help get them through long late shts. Doctors, nurses and support staff working late and at weekends say they have to use Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats as hospital catering is often based around regular office hours.

Steve, from Huddersfield, said he and a group of men battled to save the girl, who had been travelling in the HGV, which had set on fire. Have you been affected by this story  Let us know at webnews@mirror The Good Samaritan described how, despite his best efforts, he was unable to free the lorryaposs -year-old driver. Instead, Steve held his hand and was not willing to leave his side as he succumbed to his injuries. Fighting back tears, he said: I tried my hardest and I feel like Iaposve failed the family because I couldnapost do more. I just really need his family to know that the last words he heard were that we saved his daughter and she was safe. I had hold of his hand and kept telling him I was sorry, right until his final moments.  After seeing the accident ahead, Steve said he ran down the slip road and set out to rescue those involved. He was joined by three other men who were attempting to force open the damaged door of the HGV involved and smashed the passenger window. Steve has decades of experience as a HGV technician, and directed the men to focus on freeing the teenager from the vehicle, while he turned his attention on the man in the driveraposs seat.

Sharlene Bockross, from Leicester, died suddenly just after Christmas, aged , leaving behind her -year-old son Tyler. The mum didnapost have much money or assets, but what little she did was passed down to the family. However, Sharlene has spent more than £ on a Jet summer holiday to the Greek island of Kos.Jet are reportedly demanding the family go through probate - appointing an executor of Sharleneaposs estate at a huge cost -they want the money back, LeicestershireLive reports.  The familyaposs solicitor has advised them that to get the £ back they will have to pay out about £ to go through probate. Thereaposs no set level for when a bereaved family needs to go through probate, but itaposs usually for larger estates involving multiple assets. For Sharleneaposs estate, this would be unnecessary. Sharleneaposs mum, Karen Gaze, said: She died suddenly and unexpectedly on December  from a cardiac arrest. Her brother, Paul, found her and tried to resuscitate her. We are all devastated. We later learned she had a heart condition she wasnapost aware of. She was supposed to be taking Tyler on holiday on June  to celebrate Tyleraposs th birthday. Sharlene was always a forward-thinker and she would pay a bit towards the holiday every month so that she could pay for it all in advance. She had paid about £ of the £, for the two of them. The trip to Kos was for Sharlene, Tyler, Sharleneaposs sister Sammi and Sammiaposs two daughters. Karen said there was nothing in the small print of the payment plan to suggest it would be so hard to get a refund upon Sharleneaposs death. She said: Jet are very sympathetic on the phone and very nice about it, but they are telling me I must have an executor for Shareleneaposs estate, which my solicitor says is just completely unnecessary and will cost about £. The money is for Tyler and we want him to have it but all heaposs going to get is £ once weaposve paid to appoint the executor. Itaposs so annoying because weaposve set up an account for the money Sharlene did have to go into and the banks have let us get the money. But this money is for Sharleneaposs poor son and Jet are digging their heels in. Iaposve sent the death certicate and even her birth certicate to prove that Iaposm her mum. But theyaposll only send the money to the executor of her estate. Itaposs been hard for Tyler - heaposs only  and heaposs got his GCSEs coming up. Heaposs being very strong but itaposs been hard, emotionally, for us all. I just donapost want to be arguing anymore. Explaining that lying would have been easier, she said: Ironically, I could have just phoned pretending to be Sharlene and asked to cancel and they would have given me a full refund. But I decided to be honest instead. Jet confirmed they were not going to make exceptions to the rules for Karen. They said in a statement: “We would like to extend our sincere condolences to Ms Gaze and her family at this dficult time. As the account used to make the original booking has been closed, we cannot refund that account. As such, we have requested for Ms Gaze to provide documentation showing her to be the named executor of her daughter’s estate so that we can refund her directly. As we have not received this proof of authority, we are unfortunately unable to do this. We sincerely hope to be able to complete the refund once this proof of authority is confirmed, and we have been in touch with Ms Gaze to explain this.” The Mirror contacted Jet for a statement.

Martin Lewis and his Money Saving Expertteam asked social media followers for their best tips to help people who are suffering amid the c ost-of-living crisis. The team has compiled the Cost of Living Survival Guide to help Brits weather the price hikes, Hull Live reports.Families are expected to feel the sting this month as energy bills and National Insurance are increased. Council tax, fuel prices and food are also going up, leading to more people feeling the pinch. Introducing his teamaposs tips, Martin Lewis wrote: For some there is sadly no route to cut expenditure below income that fix will need political intervention.  For others, we need a collective endeavour, to work together to take financial pressures off where we can. And that is partly behind this guide. He explained the team had received thousands of replies from people with clever ideas about how to cut household expenditure. Martin described the response - which included more than , replies to his tweet alone - as overwhelming and uplting. One of the tips was to invest in a slow cooker to batch cook meals for all the family. They are available from Asda for as little as £. The Money Saving Expert team said batch cooking creates less food waste and reduces the likelihood of spending extra cash on takeaways.  One follower said they are apossaving a fortuneapos by using theirs more and more. Sharron Quaile wrote: A chef was on TV recently telling us all to get a slow cooker, as it costs p to cook a meal overnight. Made a cracking chilli the other night, gave my neighbour a portionand thereaposs one portion in the freezer. A user under the name of Living in Hope wrote: Iaposm using my slow cooker more and more these days to batch cook delicious soups, curries, stews etc then I freeze it in recycled takeaway containers. Saves a fortune all round. They added it did not cost much to invest in. It’s a standard sized one, only cost me about £ - very simple, no whistles or bells, but does the job, they wrote. The MSE guide also says that using a microwave is generally cheaper than an oven. It states a jacket potato would be more than  per cent cheaper to cook in the microwave rather than the oven.

Mick lost his job and then his home before ending up on the streets of London with his Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Benson, in . He told MyLondon : “Without him, I think I would have gone under.And he wouldn’t be able to survive without me, simply because of our bond. We’re together  . He understands me, I understand him. He’s the only thing I put my trust into and he’s never let me down.” But because of his beloved -year-old pooch, the Londoner has struggled for seven years to get housing. Their bond has only grown stronger over the years since Mick, who asked to only be called his first name, adopted Benson from his previous owner, who couldnapost take care of him anymore, at -months-old.  “How could I say no to him ” said the Londoner lovingly. “When he was three, I lost my job, then couldn’t afford my rent so lost my property, and ended up on the streets. I wrestled with my conscience over whether it was right to keep him - but he’s been through so much upheaval, I couldn’t not.”The duo appeared on the hit ITV show Paul OaposGrady: For the Love of Dogs and are known in their local area, around Liverpool Street and Hackney, with people like the shop owners, taxi drivers and station owners all keeping an eye on Benson.“I’m always conscious of him - that people might try and take him, said the -year-old, Rest and sleep is the hardest thing on the streets - you’re sleeping with one eye open.” He said: “Everything has to be centred around him and I have to worry about what’s going to happen to him. And then you can’t take him to certain services.”This includes many accommodation options for those who are experiencing homelessness. In fact, only around  percent of hostels in the UK are pet friendly, according toStreetVet , a charity working to increase this statistic and delivering free veterinary care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness around the country. According to StreetVet, to apply for housing benefits, some form of address is required. A hostel address is usually used for this, but as Mick said he struggles to get into hostels with Benson, he is unable to even get started with the benefits process. He also noted that many housing associations will not accept dogs. “You get accused of making yourself intentionally homeless so they don’t take any responsibility,” he said. “I’ve been trying to get housed for seven years. You get the choice between your room and your pet - that’s not a choice. They’re not acknowledging the support of Benson as important in my le, despite my health conditions.” Mick suffers with anxiety and depression, which he said contributed to losing his job. He believes he would have turned to drink and drugsit had not been for Benson. He said: “He’s my escape and gives me something to focus on. He’s a mainstay in my le and keeps me grounded. If he’s not around me, I feel lost - I feel secure when I’m with him. He’s not so much for protection as he is for comfort. You look at him and think, ‘It ain’t all bad - Iaposve got him. As long as I’ve got him, I’m okayapos. He added: “When you’re on the street, so many things can happen. If I start getting heated with someone, he can bring me back down. He reminds me that there are more important things. If anything would happen to me, then what would happen to him  If anything happened to him, then that would kill me, andanything happened to me then that would kill him - that’s it.” Mick claims that Bensonaposs role in apossaving his leapos has not been taken into consideration in his attempts to find a home for the both of them. Even during the pandemic, he claims he was not offered a room with his dog. He added: “I’d sooner take the risk on the street with my boy than be separated from him - simple. He also says knows some people have only just had their pets ed to them.He said: “The authorities didn’t grasp the bond between man and dog.” Founder of StreetVet Jade Statt explained that some places in the UK were better than others at housing owners with their pets - but the resounding feedback from her clients was that a poor effort was made in London. “They didn’t realise that people who have pets and are homeless are much less likely to engage in antisocial behaviour because that would end up in them being separated from their dog. You have a reason, a role, a responsibility,” said Jade. She added: “Because that dog was everything to them”. Summing up his dreams for the future, Mick said: “My dream is to have somewhere to call home - a self-contained property where me and Benson can live out our days.

All Saints School in York also warned that sweets packaged to resemble brands like Haribo, Nerds and Millions are “of particular concern.” Officers seized £, of edible cannabis disguised as Dairy Milk and Milky Bars in Wakefield, West Yorks, in March.

The Duke of Edinburgh passed away at Windsor Castle on the morning of April , with his official cause of death recorded as old age. He was  and just months away from celebrating his th birthday. The past  months have been far from easy for the Monarch, and she entered the th year of her reign a mourning widow. And sheaposs also had a huge amount of family to deal with, with more scandal surrounding her favourite son Prince Andrew and legal case after legal case from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. To mark the first anniversary of the tragic day, royal expert Ingrid Seward, author of Prince Philip Revealed: A Man of His Century, has reflected on the Queenaposs first year without the Duke of Edinburgh by her side.  She tells The Mirror: On the morning of th April , Prince Philip was being helped to his bathroom when he complained of feeling unwell. He was ed to his bed where he died shortly afterwards. ‘It was assomeone took him by the hand and off he went.’ Sophie Wessex explained afterwards. ‘It was ‘very peaceful’. After  years of marriage the Queen had lost the man she had fallen in love with at the tender age of  when she watched him jump over the tennis nets at Dartmouth Navel College in . The Queen’s reaction to her ‘beloved’ Philip’s death was typically stoic and set in motion what was called ‘Operation London Forth Bridge’. The pandemic was still gripping the country and his funeral at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor was all the more moving for its pared down form. Grief is a strange thing and for the Queen intensely private.The first time she spoke with emotion was in November in a recorded message from Windsor Castle when she praised her ‘dear late husband’ in a recorded message for the climate conference. She commended his work for encouraging people to protect ‘our fragile planet.’ In her Christmas message eight months later, she revealed real emotion. ‘That mischievous, enquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him.’ She said. ‘His sense of service, intellectual curiosity and capacity to squeeze fun out of any situation were all irrepressible.’ He made her laugh. He made her position tenable. When she worried about the family, he consoled her in his matter-of-fact way. She missed his wise council when Prince Andrew’s dramas reached their peak and he looked determined go into court against Virginia Giuffre. She missed it again when Prince Charles’s main charity fundraiser Michael Fawcett was accused of offering honours for substantial donations. Across the ocean Harry and Meghan have been occupied with litigation against the British establishment including her Majesty’s government. It has been a very tough year without him. In October she cancelled a trip to Ireland. Then it was revealed she had spent the night in hospital. Clearly things were not going her way. Doctors advised rest and later her appearances apart from one at Westminster Abbey when she was seen with a walking stick for the first time, remained virtual audiences and zoom chats from Windsor Castle. Her only time away was a weekend at Wood Farm in July when she visited her stud with her racing manager John Warren. In February this year she made her annual pilgrimage to honour the death of her father seventy years on, before catching covid at the end of the month. On Saturday she will be saying a prayer for her ‘irrepressible’ Philip and then will sit in front of the TV and watch the Grand National from Aintree. Whatever happens in her final years some things will always remain the same.

Sixteen members of the Radford clan reached Florida despite previous worries of getting the brood through the long delays.

But it wasnapost smooth sailing getting there. In a recent vlog, Sue spoke from the families home in Morecambe about the checklist of things needed to be done before getting on the plane. One of those tasks included getting a Covid test for everyone.Speaking to fans in their aposmost tense vlog everapos, Sue explained that the day before they left for the airport they would have to take  Covid tests in appointment slots with an online witness. The four appointments included four family members at a time and just one negative test could write off the highly anticipated holiday for the entire family. Sue said: Iaposm hoping, fingers crossed, that everybody is negative. I canapost even begin to tell you how nervous I am about these tests.

I keep thinking it wonapost be the end of the worldwe do have to rearrange it, I think the situation with Manchester Airport at the minute is an absolute nightmare andIaposm honest, Iaposm not keen on doing that because I think itaposs taking two and a half, three hours, to get through security, checking-in as well is taking about an hour. Obviously when youaposve got sixteen of us, you can well double that, so probably about five hours for us by that time we probably would have missed our flight.  She continued: Iaposm not wanting to go through that, I must admit. So Iaposm thinking, it wonapost be the end of the worldone of us does test positive, we can just rearrange it for later in the year but obviously the kids will be absolutely devastated. But no signs of those fears affecting the trip were shown in the short but sweet video she posted. The only mention of the airport madness was in the comments as one person said: Oh Iaposm over the moon you are there and safe! The news is horrible re Manchester airport.

The strange organism was apossquishy and softapos, and aposburrowed into the sandapos when the walker disturbed it, as the Daily Star reports.They shared a picture of the sea creature, which was found in Naples, Florida, on social media in an attempt to find out what it was.Soon they were inundated with comments from other Reddit users, as one said that the creature is a sea hare, which is a mollusc with a soft internal shell made of protein. What do you think the creature is  Let us know in the comments...Sharing the picture anonymously, the walker said: Anyone know what this is  I found him today on the beach in Naples, FL! He started burrowing into the sand as well. One person responded, saying that the creature is a sea hare, which is a mollusc with a soft internal shell made of protein. Revealing that they touched the animal, the user wrote: It was just a lil squishy and soft! The sea hare is actually a marine snail, found in shallow water and occasionally in rockpools on the low shore. They feed on seaweed and it is thought that this is what gives each sea hare its colour. For example, green sea hares like eating green seaweeds like sea lettuce whilst the reddish-maroon sea hares usually eat red seaweeds. Sea hares have an internal shell, which is around four centimetres long and transparent. Like sea slugs, the sea hare is a hermaphrodite and they sometimes mate in chains, with an inidual acting as both male and female.They lay eggs in long pink threads, which are deposited on seaweed and look a bit like pink spaghetti, according to Wildletrusts.org.

Korynne @korynnecbegan feeling uncomfortable when she woke up from a nap on the beach, only to see a man sunbathing a close distance to her, leading her to worry he was stalking her. Convinced he was up to something sinister, the TikToker decided to get her own back at the man, by running past him and kicking sand in his face as she did so, the Daily Star reports. In a video she posted on TikTok, she said: When an old man parks himself -feet in front of your towel on a completely empty beach while you were napping and you know what needs to be done. Korynne filmed the beach to show the vast space with absolutely no visitors other than the man, before putting her phone down, turning on the selfie camera and running towards the sea. As she runs past the man, who is lying on his beach towel facing downwards, she purposely kicks the sand to the manaposs back.

He quickly turns around and watches her heading to the water and the video cuts to show him packing his belongings and leaving the area. Promise Iaposll make you more uncomfortable than you make me, also my flat feet grip sand as good as a shovel, she added in the caption. After posting the video, the TikToker has been met with mixed responses from viewers. While some praised her braveness, others pointed out that the man didnapost appear to be doing anything other than sunbathing. He was literally minding his own business tanning till she ran right by him and kick sand in his face, one commented, while another added: Didnapost know you own the whole beach  However, others disagreed, with another commenting: He sat right in front of her and you can see him looking at her. She had every right to do what she did! This was so satisfying, thataposs what he deserves.

He has now been placed in pre-trial detention in notorious Lefortovo Prison, suggesting he will face major charges for intelligence failings, it is claimed. The move will be seen as a warning to other senior Putin aides who are expected to take the blame for the huge Russian death toll in Ukraine.  Besedaaposs case is being investigated by the Military Investigative Department of the Investigative Committee, said Russian intelligence expert Andrei Soldatov, who revealed the Lefortovo move. The official who was in charge of FSB intelligence and political subversion in the ex-USSR, had been on a trip to Ukraine shortly before he was detained. Putin is said to fear that moles leaked invasion plans to the West, and Beseda was detained along with his deputy Anatoly Bolyukh, but had been held under house arrest until now. The current status of Bolyukh is unclear.  The Russian leader had been convinced by secret services briefings that his troops would be welcomed by many Ukrainians, and achieve a speedy victory. In reality they have faced implacable opposition. Lefortovo jail notoriously held political prisoners in the Soviet era and is routinely used to incarcerate suspected traitors. Last month Putin also fired the deputy head of the Russian national guard. Beseda had been a longtime trusted Putin secret services official, and was in his role as head of the th service of the FSB since .  Russia has not confirmed his arrest or detention in Lefortovo. Last month The Mirror told how Alexander Bortnikov, director of the Federal Security Serviceand confidant of Putinaposs, could be the favoured replacement for Vladimir Putin.Ukrainian intelligence officials claimed a plot to remove the President from the office had allegedly started after Western sanctions crippled the Russian economy. Sources then claimed Alexander Bortnikov, director of the Federal Security Serviceand confidant of Putinaposs, could be the favoured replacement. He was said to be one of the few figures to belong to Putinaposs powerful inner circle and shares his anti-Western world view, after previously serving alongside the Russian President in the KGB.But he recently fell out of favour with the Kremlin following Russiaaposs sustained military losses in Ukraine and botched invasion.He met Putin while they both served as KGB officers in Leningrad in the s and plays a key role in ensuring the President maintains power. Putin left as a lieutenant colonel in , while Bortnikov rose steadily up the ranks. The pair have been seen hiking previously, and are said to share a love of nature.

Liu, who comes from the district of Xinzhou, in the city of Wuhan, China, married in  and became pregnant each year, but always had miscarriages in the early stages of pregnancy Doctors diagnosed her with an autoimmune disease called systemic lupus erythematosusin . She was told by medics this was probably the reason for her miscarriages as the disease attacks every system in the human body.  SLE is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks its own tissues, causing widespread inflammation and tissue damage in the affected organs.Although the doctors advised her to stop trying to have a child, she chose not to obey and continued her continuous cycle of pregnancy and miscarriage.After  miscarriages in  years, doctors noticed her body had been weakened and she started suffering from hypothyroidism.  This is a condition where the thyroid cannot produce enough of its own hormone and deliver it to the blood system. Her th pregnancy was confirmed in August  and she gave birth on March . In her fth month of pregnancy, Liu went to hospital - worried about suffering another miscarriage - after suffering bleeding, abdominal pain and other discomforts.  The doctors treated her with miscarriage protection and anti-infection procedure and a delicate foetal protection treatment plan was prepared for her. After her determined efforts to give birth Liu was finally blessed with a child gave birth via caesarian section to a premature baby. She was released from hospital three days later on March . According to Dr Guo Juanjuan, one of he experts she dealt with while trying to give birth, SLE is prone to causing miscarriages.  But it is possible for pregnancies to be seen to term safely, but only with the proper medical care.In January, The Mirror told about another woman who had given up on her dreamsgetting pregnant again.Emma White, , had given after her daughter Molly Rose was born  years ago.She had  miscarriages in  years, but shared her joy at giving birth to two miracle babies after a rollercoaster pregnancy. The mum described her pregnancy as amazing and was induced at  weeks to give birth to Aurora Azalea, lbs oz, and Ophelia Lili, lbs oz, on  October last year. Emma then said: I love being a twin mum. It’s not for everyone, but I cherish every single day. It still feels like a miracle even now the girls are three months old.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mozart to jazz trio ecossaise delight ardrishaig","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Arts Associationwas delighted to welcome Trio Ecossaise as guest performers at Ardrishaig Public Hall for the fourth concert of the season.The impact of Covid has meant that many planned concerts had to be cancelled or dates changed so it was wonderful to have Trio Ecossaise perform on March .The concert opened with the Kegelstatt Trio by Mozart. Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

The goal settled the Royal Burgh side, and Lewis Montgomery added a brace on  and  minutes.In Mowi South Division , Kilmory ran out - winners against a young Oban Celtic second team at sun-drenched MacRae Park, Lochgilphead.Goals from Sandy Leiper on  minutes and three by Alex Cunninghamsealed the points for the Kilmory.The home side enjoyed a good first half and would be disappointed with aof just two goals. Play was more scrappy in the second period but Kilmory managed to close out the match.The club thanks Crinan Construction for sponsoring the match and all the supporters who came out to watch.In the same ision, Inveraray and Bute juniors drew - at the Winterton.Bute started the match strongly, using their pace and youth to advantage. It did not take long for Craig Speirs to gave the islanders the lead on six minutes, rling home from the angle.Two minutes later Inveraray were level, Neil Campbell showing scoring from  yards.Bute again took the lead in the th minute when Aray failed to clear and Aiden McGregor took advantage.The home side settled into the game after that setback and started to play some decent shinty, though, despite creating numerous chances, the sides went into half time with the score - to Bute.Inveraray started the second half the better of the two sides, giving the youthful Bute side problems settling.With Inveraray pressing it took until the th minute for the equaliser to arrive Neil Campbell again driving the ball home. Bute pressed to find a winner but the Inveraray backline held firm.In the Women#s Camanachd Association Mowi South Division , Dunadd Camanachd scored three goals in either half to defeat Uddingston - at St Ambrose High School in an excellent advert for women#s shinty # both teams fielding young players with a bright future ahead.Dunadd looked slightly nervy starting their first game of the season but a well-taken goal from Eilidh Cameron settled the team.The next  minutes were end-to-end but the Dunadd defence stayed strong with some excellent saves from stand-in goalie Laurene Cameron.At the other end  Eilidh E Cameronwas tenacious and set up Dunadd#s second as she slotted the ball to Rhian McCuaig, who finished superbly for her first goal for the club.Uddingston, though were not going to give up and, after a spell of pressure, Christie Robertson struck an excellent shot straight in the top corner.Dunadd didn#t let heads go down. After some excellent play on the wing, Alice Adair found striker Eilidh Cameron whose shot was judged to be kicked away by the goalie.Cameron didn#t hesitate from the spot and finished low to the goalie#s left.In the second half Dunadd#s experience started to show as they settled into the game.McCuaig completed her brace, Nicola Smyth finished from close in and Cameron went on to get her hat-trick.That winning feeling # Kilmory#s Sandy Leiper in their match against Oban Celtic juniors.

All her walks can be booked as bespoke guided experiences.*The  bus service is only available on schooldays term time you would need to start and finish at Muasdale. The Scottish Citylink bus times are not suitable.**If you start and finish at Muasdale, carefully check tide tables and aim for an ebb low tide for the whole coastal section from Killean to Muasdale.With sandy beaches, an igneous dyke splitting red sandstone and the impressive waterfalls on Clachaig Water reflecting geological history, man’s time here is reflected in a prehistoric dun, the old settlement of Achaglass and abandoned dwellings that span right through the centuries.Amongst these are the wonderful old ruins of St John’s church at Killean, parts of which date back to the th Century.Although you can no longer go inside it is still possible to walk around the graveyard and view the impressive carved tombstones from a distance.According to Canmore records the burial vault is that of the MacDonalds of Largie it is believed they helped prevent further deterioration of the church in the mid-th Century.The start point is A’Chleit Church, which replaced St John’s in the th Century. Leaving the car park head south via a short path to the beach.Follow the beach south for the next .km. En route a couple of small streams are crossed.It is sometimes easier to go above the beach, especially as you approach the large rocky outcrops near Muasdale.Look out for a path that takes you up to a stile just before you reach Clachaig Water .Cross the stile and main road. Turn right to gain a view from the new bridge to the old bridge over Clachaig Water.The village store is m south of the bridge should you need refreshment. Return north from the bridge and take the first turning right .Follow the track up the hill for m until you reach a field on your right. Cross this diagonally towards the west corner of the forestry plantation.On reaching it turn right into the woods to look at the waterfalls at the bend, which, I gather, are called Peter’s Hole . The drop is sudden and vertical, so take care!From the falls head upriver, descending into the plantation, before re-ascending northeast above the river and trees.Follow the field edge you will go over a small knoll and reach a fence line. Turn left up the side of South Crubasdale farm to rejoin the track you left earlier.Turn right, then after m turn right again. The track will drop you down to a bridge over Clachaig Water before rising to a T-Junction.Turn left. After m look for a gate on your left. To visit the Duncross the field diagonally andthe same way. Please keep dogs on a lead.Continue northeast on the track for m to a Y junction. Bear left past the now empty Low Clachaig farm and bear left again at the next Y junction. Continue to High Clachaig. There is a ruined farm off to your right en route.At High Clachaig it is best to go round the buildings and walls to the right before rejoining the little used track that heads northeast into the forestry.The track is grassy and boggy # especially near the stream crossing # but easy enough walking for the km to Achaglass.Achaglass is an old settlement that appears to have been rented to a shepherdand his family back in . It has now partially disappeared amongst forestry, like so many old sites in Argyll.Continuing northeast up the Clachaig Water from Achaglass there is a fine sheep fank, m beyond this there is a bridge.Cross the bridge and take the forestry track northeast for the next .km until you reach the Kintyre Way.Note there is a cattle grid with no side gate en routeyou have a dog you may need to lt them over the fence.Turn left. You will now follow the Kintyre Way down to the coast for over km.You can take a slight short cut by taking a left at NR and then bearing right at NR down to the ruin of Braids, but it is muddier.Near the bottom, after a small dam, a left turn will drop you down through the eerily empty houses of Killean to the main road.

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Since God is eternal and therefore stands outside of time, it may be that every moment in time is always present with him.And yet, the Bible often speaks of God not remembering something – people’s sins.One example is Jeremiah chapter  verse : ‘For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.’It is not that God forgets in the way that I forget where I have left my wallet or car keys.In the Bible, ‘to remember’ is another way of talking about keeping a promise. We use ‘to remember’ in that way too.‘Don’t forget to phone me when you arrive home,’ shouts Morag, as her daughter heads home after visiting her.‘Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll remember.’Sure enough, Morag’s phone rings later, and the voice at the other ends says: ‘It’s me. I’m home.’God does not forget our sins in the sense of pretending they never happened or ignoring our failure and refusal to do what he wants.Instead, he remembers his promise to forgive the sins of anyone who asks him to do so.He is able to do this because Jesus has died on the cross to deal effectively with sin’s penalty.So, when you trust in Jesus, God refuses to hold your sin against you, but treats you in the way you do not deserve.

to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.There is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. Some of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. I thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website here.The Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours."},{"url":null,"title":"galaxy-smarties-see-easter-eggs-least-sugar","story":"Expressdentist was intrigued to find out which Easter eggs could be the best and worst for your teeth, based on sugar content, so it investigated to see what the worst for sugar content is, so you don’t need to avoid all sweet treats this Easter.Coming in the joint top spot for the Easter eggs worst for your teeth are Galaxy Ripple and Galaxy Minstrels Easter Eggs with g of sugar per g.Although two Mars Galaxy products take the top spot, the other two Mars Galaxy productsrank respectively th and nd.: I tried Aldis new Easter egg range - but which ones are worth buying In second place is the Smarties Easter Egg with .g of sugar per g.

There was laughter in the air, lingering looks at each other. Wine. Might a reconciliation be on the cards Alas, before you could say “conscious uncoupling”, everything had gone pear-shaped again. Turned out Nathan rather liked the idea of a new le. With a new girlfriend. Who was a child psychologist, a writer, and had lovely long hair like a horse. Soon, everyone was unhappy again, and that’s how we like it.It might be thought women watch The Split to pick up orce tips. Not true. We watch for the fabulous homes and the handbags, andthere’s some unhappiness along the way, so be it.There was, mind you, a genuinely shocking end to the first instalment. Perhaps it was a sign from the writer, Abi Morgan, that we will all have to do some growing up in this third series and try to take things more seriously. Sure, but in the meantime, bring on the summer season totes and those Millport-sized kitchen islands.Imagine how history might have been dferentMargaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan had met each other earlier in their lives and married. [Pause for theatrical shudder.]According to the two-part documentary, Thatcher and Reagan: A Very Special Relationshipthe pair were as close as two friends in politics could be. There was no suggestion the relationship was closer than that, despite the tease of a title.Charles Moore, Mrs Thatcher’s authorised biographer, was the man in charge. He opened the film surrounded by some of Mrs T’s handbags, reminding viewers what it meant for a Cabinet Minister to be “handbagged” by her. Ronald Reagan did not have quite that fate, though she was not afraid to let him know when she was disappointed, as she was with America’s declared neutrality in the run-up to the Falklands conflict.Moore worked his contacts from his books and landed a few big fish as talking heads, some of them better known at the time than now, but offering valuable insights all the same. There was the personal touch, too, as he reminisced with Cynthia Crawford, “Crawfie”, Mrs Thatcher’s indispensable PA.Cruise missiles, Greenham Common, the Cold War, how long ago it all seemed, particularly with the news as it is now. The film suffered as a result, but there were a few nuggets worth sharing, and the insights into Reagan, adored his strong mother, alcoholic father, made a lot of sense.A busy time on the domestic front with a couple of shows ing and a newbie on the block. Anyone would think it was spring cleaning season.The idea is seductive – an organised le is the key to a happier, less stressful existence –not exactly deep. I can’t see home organising becoming one of the great religions of the world, but it is a harmless enough pastime. Do pop some ear plugs in before viewing: contains lots of girly screaming, especially from the blokes, when they see the wonders home editors Clea and Joanna make happen.By my reckoning, The Great Home Transformationis the st show of its kind, or at least it feels that way. Presented by Nick Grimshaw and Emma Willis, its USP was its ordinariness.Tech was used to show the rooms most used by a family, and the house rearranged and decluttered accordingly.No walls were knocked through or otherwise harmed in the making of this programme. Are you taking note Kirstie There was so much product from a certain Swedish superstore it came as no surprise to find they were the show’s sponsors.At the end of the hour, asked what the tidy up would do for the family, mum said: “I can just imagine people smiling more.” Ill take that.It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

However, Holyrood and local authorities lack the powers to do this and Anas Sarwar wouldn’t even sign a joint-party letter demanding the devolution of these powers. Also, Labour voted against doubling the Scottish Child Payment to help hard-pressed families.Other than high energy costs, Brexit is the biggest cause of UK austerity and falling exports is causing real problems for our businesses, yet Sir Keir Starmer told LBC on Wednesday that “theres no case for rejoining the EU” and is in favour of the most expensive nuclear energy option which will add hundreds on to household bills for years to come. Scotland can’t afford UK Labour in power.As a leading energy-exporting country Scotland does not need nuclear power stations and should be focusing on the production of hydrogen fuel cells, the clean energy future for gas boilers, cars and ferries.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.* GROWING up in the s, we were informed that Scotland led the world with nuclear power. It was a nonsense of course. Scotland had and has no nuclear industry: we do not design, build or export our nuclear expertise.Nuclear power remains hugely expensive and dficult to build, needs guaranteed access to coolant at a time of increasingly serious climate events requires costly state intervention with subsidies, insurance and security. There is no long-term solution to waste. Scotland should utilise its share of funding to build expertise and an export industry around tidal power and green hydrogen.I actually heard a trade union rep complain that without nuclear power Scotland, as part of the UK grid, would partly rely on England’s gas-powered electricity generator. Was he really unaware that much of that gas originates in Scotland GR Weir, Ochiltree.* I HAVE been following the reaction to the UK Government’s decision to go nuclear and maintain its restrictions on onshore turbines.I wonder thoughyet again Westminster is missing yet another cheaper option.Why are we not placing bladeless turbines up and down our motorways and trunk roads  The turbines, while not quite as efficient as their bladed cousins, are cheaper to manufacture, install and maintain. Further, placing them along the roadways both avoids many planning constraints and provides another source of generation as well as the wind, ie passing vehicles. Just think, all those lampposts powered for free and the excess used to power service stations and homes nearby. Maybe even electric cars no, that would be an imaginative step too far.Perhaps before the A dialling finishes and any other major road project Holyrood might want to take the lead and plan for a bladeless contribution to our power needs.John Davidson, Carnoustie.TORIES RANCID PHILOSOPHYDR RM Morrishits the nail on the head when he characterises the Johnson Government as \"supremely competent\" in pursuing its own narrow interests rather than the interests of all its citizens. Thus the wealthy, oligarchic backers and Brexit-loving xenophobes are appeased by policies and promises that are entirely self-centred and devoid of empathy where the less well-off are concerned.This particular nail would have been obvious to many for some considerable time, but clearly not enough, as the results of the last election show us. Voters should ponder long and hard whether they wish to continue to collude with such a rancid philosophy.Dr Angus Macmillan, Dumfries.WE MUST CHANGE THE TAX LAWSAS wein the press re the UK Chancellor’s we avoiding tax , I wonder when we are going to tackle the real issue.The social group that benefits from the current tax laws is the same group that made the tax laws and the business laws that – while intended initially to encourage investment – now just protect business people from the very market forces they are always banging on about. Ditto the same group that made the company laws that saw Sir Philip Green get away with asset-stripping British Home Stores and running up huge pension deficits while buying multi-million-pound yachts for his own pleasure.It was legal. Everyone knows it was wrong but the law protected him.Those same laws mean that those who benefit from government subsidy, post-privatisation of almost everything, are de facto living off massive social handouts – the very sort which is derided when givento poor people.Pinpointing the vile iniduals who have accumulated so much of the world’s wealth while people starve and suffer the effects of climate devastationis no longer a thing.The real thing is, laws need to be updated and made fit for purpose to reflect what actually happens in the st century.Amanda Baker, Edinburgh.WHATS FAIR IS FAIRAMID all the huffing and puffing about Rishi Sunaks Budget and wealth I spotted this on Twitter: \"This fair society thing. I know exactly what it is. Everyone richer than me can pay more in taxes. Preferably a windfall tax too for being richer than me. Everyone whose property is worth more than mine should pay punitive inheritance tax on their death. Everyone who owns a car bigger than mine should pay a much higher road tax. Then my taxes could be lowered and benefits through public services that I personally would use could be raised. That seems fair to me.\"Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.TV TREATS US LIKE CHILDRENI REMEMBER the Vietnam War but have no recollection of TV news reports from the time being prefaced with warnings about distressing content. I’m also pretty sure that in  the BBC didn’t preface Richard Dimbleby’s dispatches from Bergen-Bn with such advisories.Now, however, in the excellent coverage of the Ukraine war, we are endlessly told, as for example in Channel  News on Thursday, five times in  minutes, that \"this report contains distressing images\".We know that these images will be distressing, it’s war, we understand this, we do not need broadcasters treating us like children. For those who don’t want to see reality, they know where the \"off\" switch is.Stuart Neville, Clydebank.WE CANT DECIDE ON PEACENEIL Mackay describes reports of atrocities in Ukraine with Russia as the likely culprit . He writes that evenRussia withdraws from Ukraine \"there can be no peace until both Putin and his regime are destroyed\".So far Ukraine is the only country at war with Russia, not the UK. Commentators from our country cannot decide whether peace terms are acceptable to the countries at war.Allan Mackenzie, Cumbernauld.THE OTHER WH SMITHIAN McConnells article was not just interesting from a business perspective, but also from an educational one. Narrating the le and legacy of John Menzies and the business he founded was very informative.The mention of the takeover by WH Smith in the s reminded me of another WH Smith who has largely been forgotten by history. William Smith opened a foundry in Whitchurch, Shropshire, in  with three men  years later it had grown to a company which employed more than . His \"vision\" was to be able to \"make anything my neighbour might want\".I am not sure when the business closed, but I do know that there are still manholes and drains in Shropshire which bear his name and one of the easiest to find is in the village of Ironbridge near Telford. Behind the village store a drain cover is emblazoned with it.If any of your readers are in the vicinity of Ironbridge, they should go looking for it and be impressed by a piece of social history.I do realise, of course, that I am a bit of a saddo, butits a good enough hobby for Jeremy Corbyn then its good enough for me.Gordon Fisher, Stewarton.LITTER SOLUTION IN OUR OWN HANDSTHE letterfrom George Moore requesting an apology from Glasgow City Council for \"the filthy state of Glasgows litter-strewn pavements\" typies much of what is wrong with todays society. I was reminded of an occasion, years ago, waiting for a train on Queen Street Stations low level . A fellow passenger castigated a railway employee who emerged from an office that the litter-strewn  was a disgrace to which the employee replied : \"I didnt drop the litter there, madam.\"I am sure it is not Glasgow City Council which drops all the litter. A litter-free city, indeed country, lies in our own hands.Bob Byiers, Bearsden.AN OWN GOAL FROM SCOTRAILI AM going to Hampden Park on Tuesday evening to watch the Scotland Women’s National Team play Spain. On checking the train times from Mount Florida after the match, I discover that it is an hourly service. I shall therefore drive to the game, as I am sure many others will do. I think the new owners of ScotRail are missing the twin goals of promoting the women’s game and encouraging the use of public transport.Scott Simpson, Glasgow.It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

The strength of attachment to people and place shines through both.Blood is stronger than breeding., ‘blood is thicker than water’, and perhaps it should come as no surprise to us that a society which places strong emphasis on ancestry and blood ties should have so many proverbs reinforcing such beliefs..Sad is the inheritance of a bad disease.This proverb is the perfect reminder that not everything we inherit from our ancestors is good.

It is now surely a matter of huge regret for our communities that so many small-scale care providers # despite their good reputation and obvious appeal in rural parts of the country – have been allowed to wither on the vine and disappear. on standards which followed the Covid outbreak in April and May .Budhmor’s owners are not a shadowy offshore conglomerate trying to put profit before care – but CrossReach, the social arm of the Church of Scotland. Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4008432.jpg--_the_people_you_are_visiting_may_be_particularly_vulnerable_.jpg?1629440923000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220407newsthe people you are visiting may be particularly vulnerable","story":"The public has been urged to keep wearing face coverings when visiting hospitals, care homes and other health and care settings.

That means there is much for visitors to explore, from ancient to modern history.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s Bay‘There’s no place like home’: Derry Girls writer Lisa McGee reacts to city being named among top places to live in NIYou have the completely intact -year-old Derry Walls which is a real selling point for tourists.Other historic landmarks include the Guildhall — where it now stands was once the middle of the River Foyle where ships moored. It was mostly destroyed by fire in  and after extensive rebuilding was opened in .Because it is relatively small in size, Derry is an easy place to navigate for visitors.A key piece of infrastructure built in recent times was the Peace Bridge.Nowadays it is hard to imagine the city without it, and it’s an area of recreation popular with walkers and joggers.That area is arguably the best feature of the city, expanding the city centre, linking to Ebrington, St Columb’s Park and the renovated railway station.The Peace Bridge connects the Cityside and Waterside it was a masterstroke both in practical terms and as an act of symbolism by reconnecting the largely Catholic Cityside to the traditionally unionist Waterside. Derry is also a city of culture — made official in  — with musicians, poets, painters and actors famous the world over.Danny Boy is one of the most famous songs in the world, and has been covered by Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Eva Cassidy. Phil Coulter, The Undertones, Dana, Cara Dillon, Johnny McDaid of Snow Patrol fame, Red Organ Serpent Sound, Fighting with Wire, SOAK and Wood Burning Savages show the range of musicians Derry has produced.It is also a city with proud sporting traditions in GAA and football and has produced Olympic medallists and world champions who first learned their trade on Derry’s pitches, roads and rivers.Nowhere does a festival like Derry, but there should be more added to the calendar.You have Glasgowbury in Draperstown, the City of Derry Jazz and Big Band Festival, the legendary Halloween festival and, in recent times, the Foyle Maritime Festival, which have all proven popular.When considering Derry, you also have to factor in the location. A short drive across the border and you’re in some of the world’s nicest beaches including Dunree and Tullagh Bay.To Derry’s advantage in the Sunday Times survey was an average house price of £,.“Reaping the rewards of years of investment and with a fine cultural reputation, this much-improved city stands out as somewhere cool, credible and cheap, with a bright future,” The Sunday Times states.But most people in the city would disagree with that statement, as multiple-deprivation measures, unemployment rates and analysis of investment show the second city has not received a great deal of inward investment.For example, since Invest NI was formed in  until   it has assisted , new jobs in Belfast whereas Foyle got , and East Londonderry ,.In that time it invested £.bn in Belfast and £.bn between Foyle and East Londonderry.Most ReadMaking waves: £.m coastal property in Portstewart is one in a millionAnger as Doug Beattie ‘noose’ poster is left ahead of Lurgan anti-NI Protocol rallyBelfast-based auction house to sell off drug-smuggling super yachtSuspended DUP councillor William Walker in child grooming case has left Northern IrelandDecoratordenies that he ripped off almost  pensionersTop VideosPlayAnti-protocol rally in Lurgan pleads for #Unionist unity# with #noose# posters of Doug BeattiePlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayPolice treat second fire at Belfast multicultural centre as a hate crimeLatest Northern IrelandPO Ferries set to restart Larne to Cairnryan route following inspectionFundraiser launched to help Belfast Multi-Cultural Association rebuild after latest arson attackPeace and democracy cannot be taken for granted: MartinJeffrey Donaldson ‘horried’ by appearance of noose poster at anti-protocol rallyUUP leader Doug Beattie hits back after he is branded ‘Lundy’ and ‘Traitor’ at anti-protocol rallyLatestWhitehall inquiry ordered into leak of Chancellor’s we’s tax statusI had zero feel for greens – Tiger Woods putter woes lead to worst Masters scorePO Ferries set to restart Larne to Cairnryan route following inspectionIf we hadn’t tried to catch City I would have been disappointed – Jurgen KloppBeing kings of Europe will give Man City the credit we deserve – Pep Guardiola,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Graham Baalham-CurryApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailYou can’t drink your morning coffee without an audience and as you walk down the road you are watched from all angles, both geometrically and politically.That’s right — election season is upon us and as a result, the faces of your local politicians on poster after poster are becoming more familiar than the heartthrobs we had on our walls as teenagers.It is one staple of election campaigns that has been around for decades,not centuries, and while there’s some sport initially in comparing the tenets of graphic design, colour schemes and haircutsof our political representatives, when you sit and think about it, is this something that’s really needed in this day and age As a journalist, I’m probablymore familiar with Northern Ireland’s politicians than the average person, given my job involves thinking, talking and writing about them on a daily basis. As such, I don’t often need a reminder of who there is to vote for in my constituency or what parties they stand for. I’ll admit that an election poster is certainly an easy way to raise awareness of, on a basic level, exactly who represents or wants to represent you.But after seeing the same person staring at me five times before I had crossed a single bridge in Coleraine where I live the other day, I started to wonder do posters influence how people vote — or are posters just a habit, one which may not serve the most purpose but indicates you have a dog in the fight Read MoreIndependent candidate Claire Sugden using her artistic flair for election materialThe ironic thing is that maybe posters mean much more to the smaller parties and independents with comparably smaller budgets to the more prominent frontrunners. For them, it’s more of a stretch to measure up the level of postering and the legwork it takes displayed by other parties but who worry they won’t get as much attentionthey don’t appear to have parity in terms of faces on streets.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Often described as CorriBoard posters, many of those massive signs you see on our streets and roads are made from one of the dirtiest words of our time — plastic. While the materials can sometimes be upcycled, it is suggested they will take hundreds of years to degrade, long after the politicians whose faces on which they featured and possibly even the parties they represented have departed this fine earth.It’s true that they do have benefits. They are immune to hackers which have plagued recent international elections . Not everyone has top class internet access so it does keep demographics informed. There’s no question that they send a message to voters and a reminder that an election is taking place — andyour local MLA hasn’t fixed that pothole on your road, you will know just the face to ask when they come a-canvassing.Green Party NI politician Mal O’Hara has joined some of his international colleagues in favouring a system seen in Europe where paper posters are erected in certain spaces only, instead of being festooned on every available surface. But this approach isn’t favoured by some larger parties who are able to spread their resources more widely and want to be able to show that. And so, without any wider consensus, the great poster parade marches on even in  when the word on all of our lips is the environment and many of us are kept awake at night wondering what sort of a world it is we’re leaving behind for the next generation and the one after that.What is the alternative  Some may argue it’s already here, and it’s called social media, where most views are shared and heard and your popularity isn’t always just down to what party backs you, but how well you use your voice. There’s also mainstream media via the television, news sites and newspapers as well as the radio. And for those who have access to neither, there’s canvassing — and feel free to reject those shiny leaflets which usually take a short trip to the bin in favour of a chat instead.Or why not make use of the screens in Belfast city centre or in shopping centres to instead display candidates posters on a revolving basis, on the proviso that these screens and devices would have to be made more widely available in our towns and villages Some may disregard these suggestions but surely there must be another way, instead of risking damage to the environment and obscuring our beautul landscape on this island with these massive posters cropping up at regular intervals.Whatever your thoughts on posters, the discourse around them doesn’t end after the election unfortunately. And while you might find the face of a local politician peaking out from behind a hedge or unlucky enough to be placed atop a bonfire, you will also be treated to the crowdsourcing operation that is your local politician asking you to make them aware of any forlorn final poster still lingering on our streets. Or at the very least, a photo of them with clippers in hand, telling all they are out and about removing their posters, sent to the rubbish heap, after election season comes to an end.Related topicsGreen PartyMore On Green PartyRocking the ballot box: Brian Smyth, Sian O’Neill and Paul Doherty entered politics through music activismClimate Change Bill was ‘not everything’ Green Party leader Clare Bailey hoped for PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worse PremiumSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindMost ReadMaking waves: £.m coastal property in Portstewart is one in a millionAnger as Doug Beattie ‘noose’ poster is left ahead of Lurgan anti-NI Protocol rallyBelfast-based auction house to sell off drug-smuggling super yachtSuspended DUP councillor William Walker in child grooming case has left Northern IrelandDecoratordenies that he ripped off almost  pensionersTop VideosPlayAnti-protocol rally in Lurgan pleads for #Unionist unity# with #noose# posters of Doug BeattiePlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayPolice treat second fire at Belfast multicultural centre as a hate crimeLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election SDLP’s Cara Hunter latest politician to have election posters stolen from constituency areaNorthern Ireland Assembly elections candidates in full: Who is standing in your area OpinionElection briefing: From TUV body language and not-so Derry Girls, to a dramatic Apprentice Boys rallying cryUUP Peer Empey claims ‘credible rumours’ emerging in Westminster Article  will be triggered after Stormont electionNorthern Ireland Assembly election : People ‘have a choice’ to attend polling stationCovid positive, Electoral Office confirmsLatestWhitehall inquiry ordered into leak of Chancellor’s we’s tax statusI had zero feel for greens – Tiger Woods putter woes lead to worst Masters scorePO Ferries set to restart Larne to Cairnryan route following inspectionIf we hadn’t tried to catch City I would have been disappointed – Jurgen KloppBeing kings of Europe will give Man City the credit we deserve – Pep Guardiola,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

By working in partnership with Ards and North Down and Newry, Mourne and Down councils, we have an opportunity to develop a sustainable, international walking route, which has the potential to attract visitors, both from home and abroad, to explore our outstanding countryside and learn about our incredible Christian Heritage.Cllr Enright believes that developing a trail of this scale will also encourage walkers to visit existing tourist attractions such as the Livingston Centre at Killinchy Parish Church and stop off on the way in restaurants and stay in local accommodation which in turn will bring much needed income and business to the local economy.Hinch Distillery owner, Dr Terry Cross mdash who set up the David Cross Foundation in memory of his son mdash said he was very impressed with the application for funding from Friends of Columbanus Bangor.ldquoThis project has the ability to bring people from all walks of le to meet and greet one another, regardless of their community background, he enthused.ldquoBuilding relationships, peace and reconciliation across Europe is now more important than ever given the critical situation that has erupted in Ukraine.

However, at the weekend they were determined to not give Armagh a head start and to be as competitive as possible from the first whistle.During a frantic first  minutes the Down girls did not disappoint, fighting for every ball and matching Armagh in every position around the pitch.At the first water-break Down led - to Armagh - in a very even game with Clodagh Simpson scoring a great goal and the lively Orla Owens scoring two points.During the second  minute period of the first half, the Down girls raised their own standard again and pushed Armagh back into their own half.Although Down scored a further - during this period they could have had more, and it was the Armagh team and management who were the happier team to hear the half-time whistle.Scorers in this period were Annie McEvoy with - and Orla Owens again with another point. The half-time score of Down - to Armagh - did certainly not flatter Down as their performance up to then was excellent.Into the second half and Armagh tightened up a lot and restricted Down to less clearer opportunities to score.At the other end Armagh took their own chances and scored a couple of quick goals which gave them the lead for the first time in the match. A point for Owens was the only score for Down during this period.At the second water-break the score was - to - to Armagh.Into the final  minutes and Down made changes to get fresh legs on the pitch. Another Owens point, her fth of the day, levelled up the score at Down - to Armagh - with ten minutes left.Armagh scored two points take the lead for the second time and with time running out, Down went for the goal to win the game.With the ball seemingly stuck in Downrsquos attacking third they just couldnrsquot break down the Armagh defence. With time up Armagh broke up field and scored a goal with the final play to win the match.Full time: Down - Armagh -.The Down girls were disappointed with the result but the management team were delighted with their overall performance. All of the  girls used for Down played their bit.Scorers for Down were Annie McEvoy , Clodagh Simpsonand the top scorer was Orla Owens .Best performers for Down v Armagh were Lily Magee in nets, Eloise Austin, Therese Cowan, Ava McArdle, Zara Kelly, Isa McCarron, Aoe Wolfe, Anna McArdle and captain Maia Murdock but it was Orla Owens who took the player of the match award with her five points.With the Platinum All-Ireland series still to be played in the coming weeks, and the way these girls continue to improve week by week, who knows how far they can go.The management and girls would like to thank everyone for all the messages prior to the final and for all the support on the day.Down: L Magee E Austin, F M Morgan, T Cowan A McArdle, M Murdock, Z Kelly A Wolfe, I McCarron A McArdle, H Donnelly, A McEvoy O Owens, C Simpson, E McKee.Subs: D OrsquoShea, E OrsquoKane, H McGeough, R Horisk, E Farrell, C McDermott, C McGrath, G Kelly, G McMullan, E McHugh, A McKay, H Cassin, C Lundy, T Ryan, L Elmore..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  April 8%2C 1992  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash The RNLI has unveiled plans for a major new pound, leboat station for Newcastle.The station, which is at the planning permission stage, will house the new Mersey class leboat which is due to arrive at the seaside town towards the end of November.If the station plans get Department of the Environment approval, the new complex will be constructed to the north of the harbour beside Newcastle Yacht Clubrsquos car park.The RNLIrsquos tractor house and the old Coastguard station will be demolished to make way for the building and a  metre-long slipway will be constructed to just beyond the high water mark.The new station will replace the existing boathouse which was built in  and, apart from some superficial work, has never been updated. The leboat crew and the shore team have to wash at a stand-pipe and the only toilets are an old Victoria public lavatory adjacent to the boathouse.In addition to a modern launching facility, which is clear of the problem-bedevilled harbour, the new station will provide the leboatmen with a crew room, equipped with toilets and showers, a kitchen, training room, lookout area and souvenir outlet.Work on the new complex is likely to take up to six months to complete and,planning permission is granted, is expected to start in June.The longest part of the work will be the construction of the slipway

containing a mixture of acid and caustic soda, fell from a lorry on the Old Grand Jury Road at around am on Friday morning, initiating a full-scale emergency response from the Fire Brigade.Appliances from Ballynahinch and Downpatrick were sent to the scene and a specialist equipment carrying emergency tender unit was also despatched from Belfast.The incident occurred as the articulated lorry was leaving a yard on the Old Grand Jury Road carrying a large number of the chemical-containing drums.The four drums fell from the lorry, with two spilling several hundred gallons of the corrosive

as a ldquotriumph of common sense.The comment comes from the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Associationrsquos chairman, Mr Sam Davis, who is urging all lough users to unite in supporting the new administrators.Mr Davisrsquo confidence-boosting commendation of the new body comes a matter of weeks before its inaugural meeting.SLNCA was born out of the conflict felt around the Lough by controversial DoE management proposals put forward a few years ago.The recommendation to support the new administrators on the eve of their activity will be seen as a wholehearted effort by people who are anxious to make the new management structure work.Mr Davis and the Associationrsquos joint council declared after last weekrsquos meeting that the new structure represents what the loughside community have been looking for.ldquoThe new body represents a wide spectrum of community support, including the pockets of power which were driven largely by their own self-interests, he said.MOURNES

figure of pound, for the residential home has been produced without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report.The claims were made by a deputation from the Friends of Mourne House which addressed the councilrsquos monthly meeting in Dundonald on Thursday afternoon.Friends spokesman, Mr Damian Smyth, told the meeting that the renovation figures which were produced by the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management, are completely dferent from early figures produced by the Eastern Health Boardrsquos building control officer.The officerrsquos report said Mourne House was in good repair, was free fro structural faults, and had a lespan of  years, explained Mr Smyth.He added that a more recent set of figures, produced by the unit of management on April , indicate that only minor works are needed at the home.ldquoThese latest figures say it would cost pound, to raise the standard at the home, including pound, which would have to be spent on fire safety, said Mr Smyth.ldquoThis patently does not square with the unitrsquos first report, which was used to initiate the consultation process, that it will cost a total of pound, to bring the home up to standard, said Mr Smyth. ldquoThis figure includes pound, for fire safety, pound, for a new roof, pound, for a new electrical system and pound, for a new kitchen.ldquoThese figures are bald figures produced by the unit of management with no specications and without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report, he added.PORTAFERRY mdash Portaferry has become the first town in Northern Ireland to benefit from a pioneering emergency response scheme which will save the lives of heart attack victims.The British Heart Foundation this week handed over a le-saving defibrillator which will enable doctors to provide a first response to cardiac emergencies pending the arrival of an ambulance.The presentation was made on Monday to Portaferry GPs Dr Desmond Compton and Dr David Peacock by Mr Peter Welsh, the Foundationrsquos regional organiser.The doctors believe the equipment could provide a le-saving service for , people in Portaferry and lower Ards Peninsula.It takes around  minutes from an ambulance based in Newtownards to reach the lower Ards.Even so, it would be virtually impossible to put a permanent ambulance in the area because it would be seldom used, according to the Eastern Health Boardrsquos chief ambulance officer, Mr Alan Murray.The Ambulance Service has funded the inclusion of sophisticated diagnostic facilities on the defibrillator, as well as communication systems for the doctors to ensure their immediate availability.BALLYNAHINCH mdash One of Down Districtrsquos biggest charity events of the year will take place in Ballynahinch next month.The Ballynahinch Lions k and

In the case of Jim Fitzsimons, you can take a man out of Downpatrick, but you canrsquot take Downpatrick out of a man.Jim Fitzsimons was born and reared in Downpatrick. He left the town as a young man, having graduated from Queenrsquos University, and spent the next  years or so in England where he had a successful career in further and higher education and in management training.Jim ed to Northern Ireland  years ago and for eight years lived in a cottage at Inch. Now , he and his we, Anne, live in Hillsborough where they enjoy regular visits from their three sons and seven grandchildren.But the lure of Downpatrick remains strong. When the coronavirus struck in March  and the world went into lockdown, Jim decided that the time was ripe for him to write about the town of his upbringing.The result is My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago, an affectionate account of happy times. For local people of a certain age, it will be a joyous trip down memory lane packed with names and places comfortingly familiar even with the passing of the years. For those who have no connection with Downpatrick, it is a story which is both educational and entertaining.Jim says he is pleased with the outcome of his efforts. ldquoI am very pleased with the book and I certainly enjoyed writing it. Growing up in Downpatrick we were modestly off, but we had all the things that we needed. It was a good place to live.Jim was born in March , six months before the start of the Second World War, the eldest of three children of William Henry Fitzsimons, a bread server, and his we, Marion. He and his younger brother and sister were reared in Saul Street in the warmth of a loving family and surrounded by many friends.He was educated at Fountain Street School and the Southwell School for Boys, where he and his schoolmates trembled in front a ldquosadistic master who ruled with the cane, before enrolling in Down High School in .Outside of school, there were plenty of opportunities to play sport, as well as trips to the cinema, church socials, the Boysrsquo Brigade and dancing. There were holidays at Tyrella, the annual BB camp, Sunday school excursions to Newcastle and trips to Coney Island, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Dundalk, among other places.It was a time when there were no supermarkets and there was an abundance of bread servers. Like his father, Jimrsquos grandfather was also a bread server, as were some of his other relatives. It was a time when bread servers they didnrsquot just serve bread. Butchers and grocers used them for deliveries. They also carried letters and parcels from the countryside to be posted in Downpatrick and also delivered a sizeable quantity of Down Recorders each week. In short, they were something of a social service.Jim writes about helping his father on his bread cart and also his paper round, which ended when he started in high school, collecting scrap metal during the Korean War and then ersying into collecting waste paper before getting a summer job in the County Surveyors Office in Downpatrick before starting university.He also writes about Downpatrick when it was a market town with a monthly fair and a weekly Saturday market. As the county town it had had many government offices and institutions, as well as hospitals and large factories offering plenty of employment, the county courthouse and two grammar schools.The factories have gone and the hospitals are much diminished since Jimrsquos childhood, but the town has grown considerably mdash its postwar population of around , is now over ,.Of Downpatrick then and now, Jim writes: ldquoDownpatrick was small enough to have a village feel about it. I donrsquot think this is still the case. People donrsquot know each other as they did in the past they live less in town centre terraced houses and more in detached houses in the outskirts.ldquoIn the past many men would go to the pub every evening, not to get drunk, but for perhaps a single drink while catching up with all the local news with friends. Going out to public houses is less common now and the public house and other entertainments is not solely for males. Women in the s and s ands were largely unseen, now they are much freer to do and go as they please. In  it was unheard of for a woman to go into a pub.He goes on: ldquoAlthough there is much to regret about the passing of the Downpatrick that I knew, it is a much better place in which to live. The slum houses that I remember are no more there are modern schools, an imposing new technical college with a nearby state-of-the-art fitness centre, a much expanded campus at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and advanced plans for a new building for Down High School.ldquoDownpatrick has a range of educational, cultural and sporting opportunities for all ages, for those who wish to take advantage of them. All these opportunities define the quality of a town.My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago costs pound and is available at the Saint Patrick Centre and the Grove Post Office in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Minister waste treatment refusal is blow for Arc 21  ","story":"THE decision by Stormont Minister Nichola Mallon to refuse permission for a large scale waste treatment facility at the site of a former quarry in Newtownabbey has ramications for Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority is a member of Arc which was seeking permission for the multi-million pound plant which could thermally treat , tonnes of municipal waste each year.Ms Mallon said the incinerator plant, which drew over , objections, could discourage recycling, with her decision due to be discussed at the next meeting of the local councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Currently, black bin waste collected across the district is transported by sea for incineration in Europe, with council officials keen for the districtrsquos ratepayers to continue focusing their efforts on recycling their waste.There is currently a particular emphasis on ensuring that all food waste is not dumped in black household bins, but in brown bins whose contents is treated and turned into compost.Arc mdash which is considering the decision to refuse permission for the proposed incineration plant mdash is an umbrella waste management group representing six councils on the eastern coast.It was established in  and formally incorporated in  following a process of increasing co-operation amongst its constituent councils.The organisation works on behalf of its partner councils to guide, support and help them deliver their statutory waste management obligations, drive forward innovative waste management programmes, including developing infrastructure and address greater circularity of resources.In addition to Newry, Mourne and Down, the other councils which are members of Arc include Antrim and Newtownabbey, Belfast City, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid and East Antrim.Ms Mallon said: ldquoI am not persuaded that there is a need for this specic facility. In that context, I do not consider there to be any need for this proposal.A spokesperson for Arc said there was still a ldquoclear need to develop a ldquonew, modern waste infrastructure for the region.It said the proposed facility would boost recycling, reduce emissions and provide green electricity.ldquoIt is essential that Arc has an opportunity to review the planning reasons behind the ministerrsquos statement and we will carefully consider todayrsquos announcement in that light over the next few days, added the spokesperson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Museum to shut doors over Easter  ","story":"THE Down County Museum in Downpatrick will be closed over Easter.The announcement came just hours after Newry, Mourne and Down Council refused to confirmthe museum would be open to the public over the busy Easter holiday period.Initially, the local authority would only confirm that a decision on the Easter opening would be made in ldquodue course, but within hours of informing the Recorder of this and the paper being printed, it was finally revealed that the museum would remain closed.The council has subsequently confirmed that a reduced staff team is delivering services at the museum mdash which only opens between am and pm from Wednesday and Friday mdash and it is ldquowith regret that it will not be open at Easter.The Recorder understands that are six vacant staff positions at the museum and that up to five staff members are currently off sick.Adverts to recruit new museum staff have been published this week with the local authority looking to appoint and assistant curator, education and outreach officer, museum assistant and a cultural assistant.While council officials are hoping to have new employees in place next month, the local authority has not made clear how many new staff are being recruited and what the Downpatrick museumrsquos future opening hours will be.The museum has been at the centre of a controversial staff restructuring process.Downpatrick SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said thee council should have made it clear last week that the museum would be closed at Easter.Welcoming plans to recruit new employees, he suggested that councillors should be briefed at a one-off council meeting by senior local authority officials on exactly what is happening at the museum.ldquoI remain disappointed that the museum will not be open at Easter. While I understand that work is underway to recruit new staff, many will be disappointed the museum is closed as it is one of the many jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown, he said.ldquoTourism is something we do very well in our district, but not opening what is a county museum at this time of year is frustrating and very disappointing.He added: ldquoWe need a fully ing museum in the heart of the county town. The Down County Museum is one of the districtrsquos main attractions and the visitors it draws spend time in Downpatrick and support other businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector which boosts our economy.ldquoGiven tourism is a prime driver for our economy, I am very disappointed that our museum will be shut to visitors over the Easter period and know this view will be shared by many.Alliance councillor Patrick Brown has also criticised the councilrsquos decision to keep the museum closed over Easter.He also called for staff to be moved from Newry to alleviate what he described as ldquostaffing pressures.He said: ldquoI am frustrated to see yet another blow to the Down Museum. Our county museum is so important to the area, and leading into the summer months it should be able to play its essential part in our local tourism industry.ldquoThis is particularly important this year, as we try to bounce back from the pandemic. We have already seen huge controversy over councilrsquos downgrading of the museum, and the news that the museum will remain closed over Easter is very unwelcome.ldquoI, along with other councillors, have secured a full review of museum services across the district as a whole, which is due to start this month. I look forward to seeing the results of this so that we can begin to make changes. Council urgently needs to resolve these staffing pressures, reflect on how the downgrading of the museum has contributed to them and seek the urgent reopening of the Down Museum.He added: ldquoI am disappointed that the Down Museum has become another example of how services are being moved from Downpatrick to Newry. I see all the potential Downpatrick has to be a thriving city, but time and again our services are being redirected to Newry.ldquoI want to see Downpatrick on the map as a destination town for the whole of Northern Ireland, andelected to the Assembly in May, I will fight to bring an end to the lack of delivery for Downpatrick that we have seen from the political establishment in the area for so long.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the organisation is currently operating with a reduced team of staff to deliver the services at the Downpatrick museum.He said: ldquoIt is therefore with regret that the museum opening times over the Easter holiday period will be Wednesday to Friday between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Portaferry man Peter hoping to lose 50lbs in 50 weeks during fundraiser for Air Ambulance NI  ","story":"PORTAFERRY man Peter McGrattan set himself a target of raising vital funds to Air Ambulance NI by losing lbs in  weeks before his th birthday.He started last October and has already lost  pounds, with just  pounds to go before his birthday on September .Peter is a driver for Coach Connections and coaches the Down U- hurling team in his spare time.He explained why he wanted to get involved in such a public way of losing weight.lsquoMy father Kevin was involved in a road traffic collision in Portaferry in , sustaining a traumatic head injury, said Peter.ldquoThankfully Air Ambulance NI were there on the day to treat him and swtly transferred him to Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

The team will be announced in due course.Aaron McGrady was in the Peak District along with  other runners for the annual Chicken Run which is a fell race approximately . miles distance and includes , feet of climbing.He had a strong run and placed second overall in a time of .. Aaron was more than happy to be runner-up to the winner Steve Vernon, who is a triple British cross country and mountain running champion ndash He also set the Chicken Run course record in .Steve and Aaron were the only two to break  minutes for the testing course and only nine runners made it home in under the hour so it was a creditable performance from Aaron from all angles.Sunday saw the rescheduled Titanic K. This race was due to take place in  but was called off due to Covid-.At the time a large number of runners deferred their entry to a new date in  but this also fell foul of restrictions at that time so for some runners this was a two year-old ticket.With the ers bolstered by new entrants there were  excited participants in the Harbour Estate ready for action.Paul Lloyd was delighted to finally take to the roads in a race as he has been hampered by a long term injury and has only managed a modicum of training.He last raced in June  so it was a long time coming.He finished in . which placed him th overall. This is a good marker for further improvement as he s to previous form and he commented on how good it felt to be back at a mass participation event. Hopefully he will now feel ready to enter more races in the near future.Manchester MarathonAs anyone who has done a marathon will know, the preparation required is gruelling. Most runners start months in advance and gradually increase their mileage so that they have the stamina to cope comfortably with . miles.They also need to include speed workthey want to set a good time so it is a juggling process.Gordy Graham, coached by Ryan Maxwell, had followed his schedule to the letter and had many promising race results in his build up so it was a hammer blow when he developed a knee injury with only three weeks to go.He eased off the miles in the hope that it would settle and right up to the morning of the marathon, he was debating whether racing was in his best interests.This head versus heart is not a new thing to runners. With the hours spent training for that day, sitting it out would have been too much to bear.In the end he set off with equal amounts of hope and caution and for the first hour or so maintained the pace that he needed to match his . personal best set in Belfast last year.He was in a group banging out miles at an incredible . minutes per mile pace and he felt pretty good until mile .At this point the niggle became enough to disrupt his natural rhythm and as a result his pace wavered. However, true to form he persisted to the line recording .. as he passed the tape.This result is one that would cause celebration for most and it is, in fact, his second fastest marathon but for Gordy there is still a time out there that he wants to achieve and we know that when he has assessed and treated his injury, he will be back pushing for his goal.We wish him luck in his recovery and future endeavours.Hannah Somani was also out chasing specic targets firstly to better her time of . which she set in London Marathon last October and secondly to come home in under three hours. This sub-three barrier is regarded as a holy grail for many and for Hannah being so close on in London was enough to convince her to give it another shot.She continued consistent training throughout the autumn and into the winter with multiple sessions per week as well as long runs at weekends.On her recent trip to Downpatrick she was so committed to the plan that she ran -odd miles on the morning of Jimmyrsquos Ten before heading to the start line.She then went on to run quick enough in the K to lead with two other high performing EDAC ladiestoclinch victory in the team competition.All this must have stood her in good stead as she absolutely nailed it on Sunday. She arrived at the start with quiet resolve and executed her race with precision pacing.Her time of .. was well deserved after her hard work and she was naturally over the moon. Super work, Hannah.Steph Graham was equally determined in her approach. A small matter of a wedding and a baby in the last  months might seem reason to hold back from committing to race targets but when your husband is also your coach then the lines become blurred.Gordy has had prior mention above for his own race but Steph would be quick to acknowledge his part in her achievements. She entered Manchester due largely to his encouragement as she had doubts as to whether she would be ready in time.She had been hacking chunks off her marathon times in the last few years and in Berlin  she ran . so sub . was her aim. This was a big ask as training with a young baby is never easy but she pulled it off with style.Gordy was brimming over with pride when she finished in ... Steph deserves kudos for this performance but even more so for the fact that she had to resort to the treadmill for daily miles.Despite the tedium of running miles looking at a wall, she never missed a session and her hard graft has paid off. What a team.Same distance but dferent city ndash Dee Murray had decided that Paris in the spring would provide the incentive to train over the winter months and he had racked up his miles motivated by excitement of a European marathon.The day dawned bright but chilly and it took a bit of effort to get warm enough to shed the layers before the start.Fortunately once they were lined up on the famous Champs Elyseacutees, the sun came out in fulland the , runners had perfect racing conditions for the rest of the day.Dee ran with his usual metronomic rhythm ticking off the miles and the iconic landmarks as he ran the winding route.Apart from a bit of cramp in the last couple of miles, he felt comfortable and was delighted to get a sub three hour finish in .. shaving a few seconds off his previous best which had held since .Dee is known as lsquoMr Consistentrsquo and running as quickly as he did five years ago endorses that nickname no end. It is also worth a mention that he placed a commendable , out of ,. A good job well done.With the racing season in full flow, EDAC club members were quick to get signed up on the recent membership night so that they can keep training and also avail of the club discount when entering races.They might also have been encouraged by the raffle which was held at the sign-up. Congratulations to the lucky winners who snagged bottles of wine and Easter eggs.Patrick Smith even won a free entry to Comber K.

I don’t believe that Drumcree is linked to the tragedy of the Quinn children —it was then republicans should take the blame.I’m a member of the Orange Order and I voted for the Good Friday Agreementbecause I accepted the assurances given to David Trimble by London, Dublin and SDLP, assurances which proved to be worthless.

If we hadn’t tried I would be disappointed,” he said.“If you go into the season and the only thing you have is to win the league, then we are not that club, we can’t be that club because of City and the other teams .“So, not winning the league will be disappointing but there are other things to go for qualication for Champions League, other cup competitions, the Champions League.“There is a lot to go for and for those you need momentum and you need rhythm. Whatever situation you are in, come early January it’s a situation, so work from there and don’t suffer because of it.“If the gap is too big then close it – to one point. That was not about us, we just won the games but City didn’t win all their games.“That is what I expected from us.

Each autumn, Jays, a colourful member of the crow family, can often be seen flying back and forth finding and hiding acorns to help see them through the winter. These are then hidden in the cracks and crevices of trees, but also in leaf litter on the ground. An inidual jay can store around , acorns each year and many remain buried to grow into oak trees.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Mother and her daughter counting birds in their garden, Bedford, UK, January The RSPB’s Chief Executive, Beccy Speight said “We don’t know the reasons for the sudden increase in Jay sightings this year. It may be down to food availability as we have reports that last year was poor for acorns, but whatever the reason a sighting of this stunning bird is enough to raise one’s spirits any day of the year let alone on a gloomy January weekend.“It’s been brilliant to see so many people taking part again this year, taking time out to watch and reconnect with birds and then generously submit their sightings to help RSPB scientists gain some insights into how our garden birds are faring.”Big Garden Birdwatch results also found a small increase in Greenfinch compared to . This gives scientists a glimmer of hope that this might be the first signs of a popuation recovery, but only time will tell. In recent years the Greenfinch has suffered a population crashcaused by a severe outbreak of the disease trichomonosis and as a consequence the species was added to the UK Red list last year. This infection is spread through contaminated food and drinking water, or by birds feeding one another with regurgitated food during the breeding season. Garden owners can help slow transmission rates by temporarily stopping the provision of foodill birds are seen and making sure that garden bird feeders are cleaned regularly.The House Sparrow remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings as the most commonly seen garden bird with more than . million recorded sightings throughout the weekend. Blue Tit and Starling remained in the number two and three positions respectively.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Family filling up a bird feeder in their garden, Potton, Bedfordshire, UK, January Over its four decades, Big Garden Birdwatch has highlighted the winners and losers in the garden bird world. It was first to alert the RSPB to the decline in song thrush numbers, which are still down % compared to the first Big Garden Birdwatch in . This species was a firm fixture in the top  in . By , its numbers were less than half those recorded in , it came in at  in the rankings this year, seen in just % of gardens.Throughout the first half of the spring term the nation’s school children took part in the RSPB’s Big Schools Birdwatch. The UK-wide survey of birds in school grounds saw amost , school children and their teachers spend an hour in nature counting the birds. Woodpigeon was the most numerous species seen with an average of eight per school and was seen in % of all schools that took part. Blackbird was a close second with an average of seven per school.Beccy added: “Connecting with nature doesn’t have to stop with Big Garden Birdwatch.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"pastors pen god is with us all the way ","story":"Police advise of closure of Lisburn’s Moira Road    pictures from Lurgan anti-protocol parade and rallyNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPASTOR’S PEN: God is with us all the way‘For I know the plans I have for you’, declares the Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” Jeremiah :.By The NewsroomSaturday, th April , : am  \"       \"  In this troublesome world, followers of Jesus are to show His amazing love to all and give hope to those are without hope for the future, writes Alan MIllar.

Even without the gloom and doom of the news, we could escape the fallout of what is going on in the world around us.Alan MIllarWe watched Covid- advance across Europe until it reached our shores in March , and we hoped it would all pass by Christmas, but our hope was dashed on the rocks of reality, as the disease seemed to get worse, and the lockdown continued. The stress increased and the mental health of many people, young and old alike, continued to deteriorate.Their condition was compounded by what we saw on the TV - medical staff in hospitalsm battling day and night, non-stop, to save those who had fallen seriously ill.“We saw the toll it took on their emotional and mental health some were in tears, having just lost another patient. It wasn’t uncommon to hear someone say, “Where is God in all of this ” The truth is, God was right in the middle of the battle. He had foreknowledge of what was to come . Our hope was restored when a vaccine was discovered to combat the virus.God had guided the scientists to find the cure. It was a miracle. I wonder how many thanked God  However, no sooner did we begin to emerge from the pandemic, when we saw the Russian invasion of Ukraine, causing thousands of mothers with children and elderly women, with all their belongings in a bag,to flee for their lives. Thousands didn’t get away and many have died. The fear, stress and strain on their faces spoke volumes. And people asked, “Where is God in all of this ”. God was with them all the way. .Finally they reached Poland and other eastern European countries and it was the arms of God that welcomed them in the form of Polish people who showed God’s amazing love and compassion, welcoming them with food, clothes and shelter.People all over Europe and the UK sent thousands upon thousands of tons of food and clothing for their comfort.They found food and rest for their weary souls. . God was with them all the way.Read Things to do this weekend in County Antrim"},{"url":null,"title":" pictures of young stars on the stage at portadown music festival ","story":"Tributes to Portadown student Lee Usher who died in Cookstown collision    pictures from Lurgan anti-protocol parade and rallyNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPeople, winner of the P-P Songs From A Musical Show with her performance of I Know Its Today from the musical, Shrek.
