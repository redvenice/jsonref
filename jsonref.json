He grew up in Leipzig and spent his childhood under communism, then his teens, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, under capitalism he was fascinated to see familiar streetscapes colonised by advertising hoardings. His career has reflected that dichotomy. He has worked as a commercial photographer to fund an enduring fascination with the post-Soviet atmospheres of the east. When fellow art students relocated to London or Berlin after graduating, he settled in Moscow and began making photographs of the city’s interiors, taking his Hasselblad camera into waiting rooms and tiled hotel lobbies and curious bars, alive to juxtaposition and surreal comedy.This picture was taken in the meadows on the banks of the River Moscow, on the fringe of the 850th anniversary park. The contrast in scale and tone between the picnicking mother and her toddler and the vast, foreboding architecture of the electricity pylons is typical of Herfort’s work. He is drawn to scenes in which people innocently inhabit places slightly beyond their understanding, as if they have been dropped there from a different time and place altogether.There is something about what he calls the “chaos and the lightness and good-naturedness of ordinary Russians” that he tries to frame in different ways. The contrasts between the pictures he takes are as important as the contrasts within them. “I was always interested in shooting single photographs,” he says, “which show worlds and stories in one image.” He finds the classical reportage style, where you photograph 30 images of a story in series, too repetitive. “I think you can skip the before, after and in between. This is for me photography, the art of using just one frame.”Russian Fairytales by Frank Herfort will be published by Kerber Verlag (£36) later this spring"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a864b7602abdeb616f92a00d0ff9c031a6ca9877/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9d51181c7a46d00bf29cbdba812dc02","title":"naoise dolan im not good at presenting myself as likable","story":"The young Irish writer, who has won acclaim for her debut novel, on writing in a time of crisis and finding comfort in small routinesIt’s the author’s equivalent of the no-trousers-in-class nightmare: your first book is finally published but almost every bookshop across the world is closed. With the outbreak of coronavirus, this once unimaginable vision is now reality for hundreds of writers who have been cruelly caught out – a book newly published and no shelf to put it on.Naoise Dolan is one such author. We were supposed to meet in a London cafe in mid-March, but events intervened and our cosy meeting was hurriedly changed – to a socially distant interview across two park benches, then a very socially distant chat on Skype. The 27-year-old Dubliner, who is here to promote her novel, Exciting Times, groans: “I just did a bunch of interviews in Ireland and now I know every single one is going to start: ‘I met Naoise Dolan in simpler times, in a simple cafe, as she sipped her simple flat white and simply shook hands.’” Her aptly named debut follows Ava, a directionless 22-year-old who leaves Ireland by spending her “abortion fund” on a ticket to Hong Kong. There she teaches English and meets Julian, a 28-year-old Etonian banker, and the two enter a careful sexual arrangement that teeters on becoming emotionally meaningful. As Ava sees their relationship: “It didn’t have a name, apart from hanging out, catching up, or popping in for a chat, which was, to be fair, the content of what we were doing.”When Julian temporarily returns to England, along comes Edith, a Cambridge-educated lawyer a drifter among Hong Kong’s elite twentysomethings. (“Her accent was churchy, high­up, with all the cathedral drops of English intonation,” Ava observes.) Where Julian is emotionally distant, Edith is unabashedly enthusiastic about dating Ava and the two are happy for a while. But for all her clever thoughts about love, sex and power, Ava’s reluctance to tell either Julian and Edith about each other begins to cause problems as Edith says later: “If you really think there’s nothing intrinsically wrong with fucking multiple people – and you’re right, there isn’t – then why did you lie to me?”Exciting Times is, at its heart, not about the pros and cons of bisexual polyamory but a touching exploration of modern female self-loathing as seen in recent novels such as Ottessa Moshfegh’s My Year of Rest and Relaxation or Sally Rooney’s Normal People. (During her time as editor of literary magazine the Stinging Fly, Rooney published the first excerpt of Exciting Times.) And in a time when even prolific readers are struggling to keep their attention on books, I’ve been pushing Exciting Times on everyone I know: it is the perfect blend of caustically clever and emotionally engaging. Some of Dolan’s pithy observations of her characters are the best I’ve read since Edward St Aubyn. “There was something Shakespearean about imperious men going down on you: the mighty have fallen,” Ava thinks after sex with Julian. Ralph, a self-described “PPEist”, “had voted for Brexit to have tighter borders, and was applying for an Irish passport to avoid being stopped at them.” Victoria “had large teeth. They made it difﬁcult for her to smile without scaring people, which was why Victoria smiled a lot.”Dolan grew up in Dublin, surrounded by books and with no urge to become a writer until she studied at Trinity College. She has lived in Singapore, Hong Kong, Oxford, London, Italy and then Ireland again. “I’m more interested living outside of Ireland than in it,” she says. “Some of that is material reality – it is not nice living somewhere that is very expensive and falling down all around you. But it is also easier for me to be away from people I know.”Speaking to Dolan, it’s hard not to be dazzled by how accomplished she is, both as an author and as a thinker. She doesn’t buy into the idea of “the Author”. (The tale of how Exciting Times came to be could be summed up, as she puts it: “I wanted to write a book, so I wrote one.”) When asked about her thoughts on, say, the role of writers in a time of crisis, she says, seriously: “Well, I seek to dismantle the idea that having a job is a good thing because jobs are an excuse for a social construct whereby a minor social class hoard the means of survival and portion them out as and when they see fit to ultimately allow them to hoard more. But, inasmuch as we need to produce to justify our worth, I guess there is an argument that if people don’t read novels, they will find solace in other ways that deplete our resources more – so, maybe, in a roundabout way, novels ultimately save us from burning fossil fuels?”Such big picture thinking may sound exhausting but it is standard for Dolan, who is watching people’s reactions to the current crisis with interest. “I do wonder, when people I know who aren’t panicked by climate change won’t leave their house over this, how much blind panic should I then be feeling, as the person who is normally reacting to ecological and social breakdown way before everyone else,” she says. “But I’m just gormlessly scrolling Twitter.”Dolan is autistic and finds comfort in small routines, a source of solace now much curtailed. She gives the example of buying a flat white: “Now that sounds like such a ridiculous thing to complain about. But it’s not about the coffee, it is about having a certainty from which things can flow. Because so much of the world is overwhelming to you when you are autistic, being able to put some things on autopilot is a huge relief and lets you make decisions in a reasonable time frame. So buying a flat white tells me I can then look at my emails or write 1,000 words. When one thing goes, the whole ecosystem goes. But it is objectively ridiculous to complain about a coffee.”Does she find it frustrating how quickly great change has happened, planes grounded and allowances made for remote working, as an environmentally minded autistic person who was told such change was impossible? “It is understandable – if you think something will personally impact you tomorrow, you will have a more visceral response to it than if it will kill people in other countries in 10 years’ time,” she says. “But the fact that accommodations can instantly happen is quite annoying. Autistic people have been asking for these allowances for so long – now abled people need them, snap, they’re here.”She doesn’t think calamity makes for better books. “I wasn’t tracking literature when 911 happened, being a primary school kid and that,” she says. “But I think the fact that we’re not talking about the great age of 911 novels is because, in practice, ecological and societal breakdown makes people worry and not better writers.” The idea of her own novel providing comfort now is “absurd”, she says – but then adds, almost sweetly, “though I hope it does.”She suspects many readers won’t like Ava, for her indecisiveness, her self-hatred, her self-awareness. “They’re allowed,” she says. “But I feel quite vulnerable when people judge things based on whether they like people or not, because I’m not good at presenting myself as likable. I find it jarring when people describe politicians as wooden or cold – not critiquing their policies, but saying: ‘I think his face was insufficiently caring.’” Citing a recent controversy in Irish politics (former Fine Gael politician Catherine Noone describing the taoiseach Leo Varadkar as autistic), she says, darkly: “There are plenty of reasons to criticise Leo Varadkar without saying: ‘He’s on the spectrum.’”Both Dolan and Ava are unsettled by the idea of doing something just because other people are. “You had to pretend to feel sad if you’d been single too long,” Ava notes. “I hated doing that because there were other things I was actually sad about.” Dolan gives the example of small talk about weather: “People say they don’t know why we talk about weather, but we know exactly why: so we can avoid talking about other things and they still want noise. People don’t want to be told that. But I need to know the underlying purpose, why things are the way they are, which means I discover why people act the way they do when others wouldn’t have to analyse that behaviour. I can explain why people do things in a way that completely spooks them.” It is like Ava teaching English: she uses grammar intuitively, but only understands it when unpacking the rules for the children in her classes. “I am allistic as a second language, in that sense,” says Dolan.In several ways, her radar for the minutiae of human interactions, and her wry understanding of why we dance certain dances, is what makes her such a brilliant novelist, at 27 and with one book under her belt. Perhaps it is because she understands there is “one great mystery”, she says, and she’s determined to crack it: “What do other people think when they profess to not think about what I am thinking about?”• Exciting Times by Naoise Dolan is published by W\u0026ampN (£14.99).

Young, old, rich, poor, northerner, southerner – everyone is at risk of catching, spreading and potentially succumbing to the coronavirus.However, this doesn’t mean the impact of this crisis is being felt equally. More and more, the notion that this epidemic is some kind of “great leveller” is being exposed for what it is – a complete myth.But one of the biggest underlying factors driving the disproportionate number of deaths in BAME communities is socioeconomic. It’s an uncomfortable truth that people from ethnic minority backgrounds are overrepresented in poor, overcrowded accommodation, or households with multiple generations under one roof. And it’s a fact that they are more likely to live in poverty or work in precarious and low-paid jobs. Many simply don’t have the luxury of being able to work safely from home during the lockdown. All of this contributes to a BAME population with worse health than average, lower life expectancy and a greater prevalence of serious underlying health conditions, such as heart disease, asthma and diabetes.With what we already know about Covid-19 and how it attacks those with underlying health conditions, it’s hardly a surprise that those from ethnic-minority backgrounds may be more likely to catch it and, it seems, die.It’s by no means a revelation that there’s a link between health and socioeconomic inequalities – certainly not for those who live these lives, or for all the charities, campaigners and organisations, including City Hall, that have been fighting these injustices for years. But one of the unexpected consequences of this crisis is that the depth of these inequalities is being laid bare in such a stark fashion.Of course I welcome the government’s announcement last week to launch a review into why people from BAME backgrounds are being disproportionately affected by Covid-19. But I fear we already know the conclusions of the review, and what action is needed.What would be particularly useful right now is a commitment to routinely collect and publish data on the demographics of everyone impacted by the coronavirus so that we can understand and act on these concerns. At the moment, we know the age and sex of everyone who contracts and tragically dies from the coronavirus, but we still have little additional reliable information, including about their ethnicity. If the information was collected and published in real time, it would help bring the true scale of the problem to light and provide more evidence about how to protect communities from the virus. Promises to provide this data in the future is not good enough – we need it to be collected and published right now. There simply is no good reason to wait.There will inevitably be those who say that this has nothing to do with someone’s ethnicity. Even though it can be uncomfortable for some to acknowledge, we cannot ignore the barriers of discrimination and structural racism that exist in our society, which contribute to ethnic minorities being more likely to suffer from poverty, have underlying health conditions and work in insecure, low-paid jobs.So this must be a wake-up call for our country and a catalyst for far-reaching and fundamental change. I’m a proud Londoner who often talks about how nowhere else in the world could someone from my background – the son of a bus driver, the child of immigrants and someone of Muslim faith – reach the position I have. But I want us to be even better and to live up to our British values of fairness, equality and justice for all.That’s why, once this crisis is over, we will need to forge a new social contract that advances the twin causes of racial and economic equality, and prioritises the welfare and wellbeing of every single community in this country.Ultimately, this would be the most fitting tribute we could pay to all the courageous people who have lost their lives on the frontline of this battle. And it would be the only way we can create a country where never again will someone’s race, background or socialeconomic status determine the difference between life and death.• Sadiq Khan is mayor of London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83f9917f6daf94932e53dc01afcb7639f7b8b2f5/0_182_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f759e4a1e42c7dec68ace24042e5848","title":"live music silenced performers covid 19","story":"Deprived of income from live concerts by Covid-19, musicians and venues are in a fight for survival. Thankfully, fans can helpFor the last few weeks a nightly musical ritual has taken hold of a small but growing corner of Twitter. Thanks to Tim Burgess, singer with the longstanding British group the Charlatans, each evening at an appointed time, anyone who fancies participating puts on a particular album – and, as it plays, posts their thoughts with the hashtag #timstwitterlisteningparty. Better still, musicians who made the tracks often join in, adding their insights and recollections.I have taken part in two events far – for the Flaming Lips’ 1999 masterpiece The Soft Bulletin and Our Favourite Shop, the Style Council’s evocation of Britain in the Thatcher years, released in 1985. Music of any kind is usually life-affirming: talking and thinking about it often has the same effect. This is a big part of how many of us are getting through the crisis. Moreover, as the grim effects of the outbreak become clearer by the day, what we are listening to offers a comforting reminder of the world we suddenly left behind mere weeks ago.At the same time, however, music and its surrounding culture are being weakened. Obviously, public performances of any kind have all been cancelled, and the hiatus could conceivably last well into next year. Festival season seems to be a write-off. And in the fine details of research about how the virus spreads, there are actually suggestions that the participatory aspects of music have been in part responsible for Covid-19’s transmission: witness a senior German virologist’s claim that over the last weeks and months, “wherever there was singing and dancing, the virus spread more rapidly”.As with the rest of the economy, over about the last 20 years the business of music has seen a polarisation between a handful of huge entities at the top – your Ed Sheerans, Taylor Swifts and Beyoncés – and everyone else. For the latter group, all the main sources of substantial income are suddenly either shut down or under threat. The temporary halt to playing live removes the one dependable way musicians can make money. Royalties from music being played in pubs, clubs and shops are suddenly in jeopardy, and with advertising revenues down, the fees paid to music publishers by broadcasters may be cut. Given the long-term decline of physical sales, that only leaves streaming – at which point, let us remind ourselves that YouTube’s average per-stream rate has been put at a princely 0.13p, and that Spotify is reckoned to pay artists an average of 0.26p per listen.Last week I spoke to a musician I have extensively written about for music magazines and watched play to a festival crowd of 4,000. As he explained, the realities of being in a critically acclaimed band that is run – very tightly – as a small business, many things became even clearer. “I don’t think there are many bands who make a significant income from their recorded music,” he said. Instead, an annual or biannual run around venues here and abroad will bring in up to two-thirds of an act’s turnover, and the summer is often the basis of whole livelihoods: the cancellation of festivals, he said, had spelled the disappearance of “all the money we’d be expecting to make this year”. Payments from Spotify arrive every six months: the band has some songs that have amassed close to a million plays each, but their last payment was for about £600.According to the campaigning organisation the Music Venues Trust, 556 places classed as “grassroots music venues” are reckoned to be at risk of permanent closure. Late last year, it looked like this vital part of the cultural map had finally got the attention of the government and music industry, and arrested a 10-year decline partly linked to urban gentrification and skyrocketing rents. Now, once again, venues face disaster.In the classical music world, things are just as uncertain. Outside Britain’s big “portfolio” orchestras, most musicians are precariously employed. One conductor I recently spoke to drew my attention to an awkward fact: that audiences for classical music tend to be older, and will therefore be anxious about any return to past concert-going habits. He also mentioned his work with a choir in Yorkshire that has lost two of its members to Covid-19, and how important collective singing is to so many people’s lives. That simple pleasure, he reminded me, is suddenly reducible to “people in a room where everyone’s breath is repeatedly coming out”.Of course, to write about this in the midst of an international emergency might seem misplaced. But beyond the superstars, a lot of musicians are actually more vulnerable than people in other professions. To help them, you can buy the odd CD and record from an independent shop by mail order. Have a look at Bandcamp, the platform for independent musicians that supports them to a much greater extent than the services hosted by corporate record companies and big tech firms. The Musicians’ Union is hosting a crowdfunder for members facing hardship, offering emergency payments of up to £200. But all of us should also think about the wider context of this cultural crisis. Amazon’s share price has recently rocketed by a third. Netflix, all of whose offerings feature an ocean of music, is in the middle of a boom. Big tech, which has built so much of its power on downloading and streaming, will emerge from this period comparatively unscathed. Somewhere in those facts there may lie the key to how we keep music and musicians going, and avoid a dreadful silence that would make this crisis even harder to bear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3081c608481a86845bf1844b114d3637d8cc215/0_341_5118_3073/master/5118.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9b5453984b322f96186d3cfa520b4a4","title":"the guardian view on lockdown reading not just a way of escaping","story":"It’s no surprise that people read a lot when stuck at home. But novels are more than a way to kill timeOf course there is more time for things like reading when we are stuck at home, unable to socialise or go to museums and concerts – or to borrow books, since libraries are shut. But it is notable that fiction sales, along with home-learning titles, experienced the greatest boost as the UK’s lockdown began, because this indicates that it is not facts that people are after, but stories.For busy people, time to read fiction is often associated with holidays. With family get-togethers and outings disallowed, the fortnight either side of Easter was hardly that – even for children and adults with time off work. But the pandemic has forced a break in routine and presented people of all ages with many hours to fill up. Spying an opening for one of her enthusiasms, the Chinese-American writer Yiyun Li set up an online book group to read one of the longest of all novels: Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace. Waterstones reported that big names including F Scott Fitzgerald and Toni Morrison were selling well – although cutbacks by wholesalers have led to delays and difficulties, particularly for independent retailers (in San Francisco, the iconic City Lights bookshop raised $500,000 from supporters after warning that its future was in jeopardy).“The house of fiction has not one window, but a million,” wrote Henry James. People read and write novels in a multitude of ways. While Camus’s readers are curious about how a French existentialist thought a disease outbreak might pan out, some people will be seeking entertainment or distraction.But there is one thing that readers of fiction have in common: the wish to be absorbed in a story that is not about themselves. It’s not hard to see why such flights of imagination attract those who are physically confined. Not only because they have the power to lift us out of our domestic settings and away from the panicked scrolling of news headlines, but also because they can interest us in the lives and characters of other, made-up people.Except for young children, reading is usually a solitary activity. But it is the opposite of antisocial. Of course there are cruel and cynical novels, and many that are not primarily interested in human beings or relations. But plays, poetry and fiction have made a vast contribution to our knowledge and understanding of each other. As well as a private pursuit, reading is a builder of fellow feeling. That’s why many people find bookshops, libraries and book groups so congenial.EM Forster once described words as “the wine of life”. Clearly this is the wrong metaphor for non-drinkers. But it neatly conveys the garrulous aspect of literature: the ambition that it should bring people together.

The grades that they issue to exam boards by the end of May are what they believe candidates would have achieved in public examinations if the school year had operated as normal.Ofqual, the exam regulator, has instructed schools not to share those grades or discuss them with families. Despite that, parents are contacting teachers to lobby for their children. Some are offering mitigating circumstances for disappointing mock results, for instance, or insisting that as their child has a private tutor, they would have done better than expected in exams.Tom Middlehurst, the director of policy and public affairs at SSAT, a school network with 3,000 members, many of them academies, said: “The difficulty is that the kind of parents who are having those discussions and making that effort are likely to be middle-class parents and what we must really not allow to happen this summer is that educational inequality widens. Already with home schooling and school closures there is likely to be a long-term impact on the more disadvantaged and we have to mitigate this where we can. Of course parents want to be reassured by what is going on but they must allow teachers to use their professional judgments to make those decisions.”The Alsager School in Cheshire, in response to students badgering staff about grades, has told parents and pupils that “there is nothing that iniduals can do that will influence their final grades” and that GCSE and A-level pupils will no longer be set work by their subject teachers.Ormiston Forge Academy in the West Midlands has also asked pupils to “please refrain from contacting teachers about suggested awarded grades”.Elsewhere, teachers are receiving a sudden rush of extra work from pupils who fear they have underperformed in class, in the hope of an 11th hour reprieve. One member of staff at a high-performing sixth form college said he had never received so many emails from parents thanking him for teaching their child.Teachers face a difficult and novel challenge in putting classmates in rank order. The number of candidates for GCSE maths and English in particular, is substantial, with hundreds of pupils bunching around grades 4 and 5.Even then, the grades schools submit to exam boards are likely to change when the final results are published in August. A standardisation process will apply statistical adjustments to teacher-assessed grades, using data about each school’s performance in previous years and the cohort’s prior achievement in key stage 2 tests or GCSEs.Ofqual has said that it plans to put “more weight on statistical expectations” to even out teacher grading that is too severe or too generous.But some headteachers are concerned that if too much weight is given to schools’ previous results, it may disadvantage pupils in secondaries that are on an upward trajectory.Middlehurst said: “While we understand the need for using schools’ prior attainment, we are concerned that this will unfairly disadvantage the students at schools that have made concerted efforts to improve in the last 12 months. Many SSAT members have been in touch to say that they are honestly predicting significantly better results in 2020 than in previous years. This is not about league tables as they will not be published this year it is about the inidual pupil getting a fair result.”Concerns have also been raised about whether high achieving pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds will receive the grades they deserve. Research shows that these students are generally predicted lower grades by their teachers on Ucas forms than the ones they go on to achieve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbfa8e440de3d45aa197b051ff7bd8449d2e7806/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d29de73794d8ab5d58e4be348ddcca6","title":"teachers england condemn speculation school reopenings coronavirus lockdown","story":"Unattributed comments from government spread fear and confusion, headteachers saySchool leaders have called for an end to “irresponsible speculation” over dates for schools in England to reopen, as ministers were forced to reject suggestions that many pupils would be back in classrooms next month.The Sunday Times claimed that “senior ministers” had backed a plan for schools to partially reopen on three possible dates: immediately after the current lockdown is scheduled to end on 11 May after the half-term holiday on 1 June or at the start of the school year in September.But on Sunday education secretary Gavin Williamson said that he could not give a date for when schools would reopen. “Of course, I want nothing more than to see schools back, get them back to normal, make sure the children are sat around learning, and experiencing the joy of being at school,” he said.“But I can’t give you a date. Because before we do, we need to meet five tests.”He also said that there were no plans to open schools over the summer holiday to make up for time lost in lessons during the lockdown.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the use of unattributed comments from the government was spreading fear and confusion among parents, students and staff.“The current frenzy of speculation about schools clearly comes from people outside the education arena demonstrating a profound misunderstanding of schools and the education context. A return to school is not a matter for debate – it is a question for science.“Schools stepped up immediately alongside other public services in response to this crisis. Not through compulsion but through a determination to play their part. Instructing school leaders and their teams to return without including them in the planning stages or sharing proper safety arrangements would be extremely reckless.”Williamson and Michael Gove quickly moved to dampen the speculation, saying they would only open schools to all pupils when they had been advised that it was safe.Gove said on Sunday: “The facts and the advice are clear at the moment, that we should not be thinking of lifting these restrictions yet.”Kirsty Williams, the education minister for Wales, said: “As I confirmed last week, schools in Wales will not open for statutory provision imminently. Of course we are working on plans for what and how there could be gradual reopenings, and I discussed this with international counterparts on Thursday.“The government in England has already today corrected the story that was briefed out regarding an early reopening for their schools. We will base our decisions here on evidence, consultation and right timing.”In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: “Decisions need to be solidly based and not premature. We don’t yet know what will be possible and when.”The National Education Union’s petition to delay reopening schools until safe to do so has gained more than 160,000 signatures.Its joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said: “These stories apparently placed by ministers are completely irresponsible.” Courtney accused the government of “talking about different opening dates with no hint that the science will lead the decision”.Since 23 March only vulnerable children and the children of key workers have been attending school in person, while teachers have remained working on distance learning and support for pupils at home.Suggestions of an immediate reopening were also contradicted by the Department for Education’s ambitious plan to distribute laptops and broadband routers to disadvantaged year 10 pupils in England who lack the devices.Williamson said: “By providing young people with these laptops and tablets and enabling schools to access high-quality support, we will enable all children to continue learning now and in the years to come.”The DfE said schools would be able to request the equipment from next week, although it did not say how many it expected to provide.About one in eight secondary school pupils are eligible for free school meals, and when combined with those previously in care or with social care orders, about 90,000 children could be eligible.Some teachers were sceptical about the DfE’s ability to quickly distribute laptops, arguing that its effort to provide £15 food vouchers to pupils on free school meals was still plagued by delays.Williamson was also asked if staff working in schools needed protective equipment such as masks, and said the government has asked Public Health England to work directly with unions. “Their safety is absolutely paramount as it is for children and we have issued guidance,” Williamson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94baf2f835bce518c9544eb69a91da635307857a/0_229_1859_1115/master/1859.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e1a9775d54b5f0fe14ea1ec85718008","title":"grizzly bear canada indigenous conservation british columbia","story":"When a bear starts feeding off garbage and loses its fear of humans it is quickly shot but an unlikely conservation partnership may be setting a different pathIn early April, a young grizzly bear swam through the chilly waters off the western coast of Canada in search of food.He came ashore on Hanson Island, one of more than 200 rocky outcrops in British Columbia’s Broughton archipelago, and quickly started eating garbage from a cabin.It was a dangerous move: bears that get too comfortable eating food waste and start to lose their fear of humans are quickly shot.But this bear’s death was averted through an unlikely partnership between local Indigenous groups and conservation officers, raising hopes of a more holistic approach to wildlife management with greater Indigenous input.In recent years, the presence of bears along the scattering of islands has become a cause of concern for locals and conservation officers.Typically, after months of hibernation, grizzlies in the region will hunt for clams and mussels. But this bear smelled something better and easier: garbage.Locals named it Mali, in honour of the Mamalilikulla First Nation whose traditional territory encompasses the collection of islands.And as Mali continued to forage for food scraps, conservation officials took notice.The province has a long and often fraught relationship with grizzly bears. Until 2017, trophy hunting was permitted in the province – a deeply isive practice that had lost public support in previous years. As many as 250 bears, from a population of 15,000, were killed annually.The practice has also ided First Nations: many had provided guiding services for hunters and benefited from the hunt, but other Indigenous communities have grown frustrated with the speed with which conservation officers shoot problem bears.In January, a male grizzly named Gatu appeared in a neighbouring community on the northern tip of Vancouver Island. He became too comfortable around humans. First Nations pleaded with conservation officers to come up with a proactive approach.But their request “just fell on deaf ears” and the bear was shot and killed, said Mike Willie, a wildlife guide and hereditary chief of the Kwikwasut’inuxw Nation.As elsewhere, conservation officers in British Columbia have long taken the view that a habituated bear – one that has lost its fear of humans and is comfortable rummaging for food in urban areas – is effectively a dead bear walking.But when a local guide showed him footage of the new grizzly, Willie hoped this time might be different. Working together and with the non-profit Grizzly Bear Foundation, local First Nations hatched a plan to trap the bear and transport him by helicopter.“We don’t want our bears killed any more. We have the right to govern within our own traditional territories and we have inherent rights and we have title,” said Willie.Conservation officers were initially set on killing the bear, leading to a brief standoff between the two groups. Soon, the province’s environment minister was weighing in, asking all involved to consider a different, non-lethal approach.“Once everything settled down, the conservation officers switched from a kill plan to a relocation plan. And it was amazing really to see them in action,” said Nicholas Scapillati, head of the foundation. “They became very caring about how they could trap this bear and relocate him safely.”On 13 April, Mali was successfully captured alive and moved to an undisclosed location on the province’s mainland.“Within minutes of waking up, he wasn’t eating garbage. Now he’s in a remote, beautiful estuary, eating sage grass, which is what he should have been doing,” said Scapillati.The province’s minister of environment, George Heyman, praised the result, saying the “desire for reconciliation” with Indigenous peoples helped guide the process.While the bear’s life was saved, locals worry that diminishing food sources, including a decline in salmon, could prompt more bears to make the journey.But for Willie, the success with Mali marks a critical first step in changing what he sees as outdated views of conservation.“It feels that this could be a blueprint to move forward – for us and for other First Nations on the coast,” he said. “It was a really good ending.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0d82b36230baf7ae02010d8bfb77eaa7602becd/233_0_833_500/master/833.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ef1114cd6c4eedf81912240dc4ce957","title":"the guardian joins forces with hundreds of newsrooms to promote climate solutions","story":"As the 50th anniversary of Earth Day approaches, we’re partnering with newsrooms around the world to report on solutions to the climate crisis – and drive hopeEven as the coronavirus pandemic terrorizes the world, there’s another global emergency the media can’t afford to stop covering.Fifty years ago this week, the environmental movement staged the first Earth Day demonstration to call attention to environmental degradation and demand reform.

Kyle Pope, CCN co-founder and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, writes that in 2018, “broadcast news outlets gave more airtime to the royal baby than to the warming earth”.In 2019, that started to change. “The climate story seemed to be moving from slow to fast, as the effects of the crisis were becoming impossible for even the most stubborn newsrooms to ignore,” Pope writes. “Floods in Venice and droughts in India were ready-made for the evening news. Devastating fires in California and Australia led news broadcasts around the world. Mass protests and their student leaders adorned magazine covers.”While the project began in the US, Covering Climate Now has quickly gained traction globally and now includes dozens of international news organizations and coverage in multiple languages.

Chinese cooking really benefits from it, but I find it works really well with Indian cooking, too. If I make a dal and don’t want to bother with frying the spices to finish it, I’ll serve it with a spoonful of this. I use it for salad dressings, with lime juice or vinegar. As I’m not a big fan of mayo in egg salad, I use it for that, and it works well in chicken salad, too – mix it with a bit of creme fraiche or yogurt. You can also stir it into mayonnaise to bump it up bit.Remember to stir the chilli oil well to grab the bits of chilli and the other flavourful components at the bottom of the jar.

Andi Oliver is a chef and the host of BBC Two’s Great British MenuTinned sardines are very underrated and you can do the most simple, delicious things with them. And they’re so good for you – all that omega3. I don’t think it matters if you buy them in oil or water.Sardines on toast is proper old school I think it’s nice with chopped egg, herbs and a good squeeze of lemon.

Put them in a tagine, in a stew with chicken, through couscous with olives and salty cheese – any way you would use dried apricots in cooking, you can use tinned peaches.Anything that sits still round here usually ends up in a Kilner jar, so I pickled them: drain them thoroughly, reserve the juice and boil it up with vinegar, oil and a generous pinch of salt, then pour over the peaches in a sterilised jar. They’re sweet and salty great in a salad or with cheese. I just love them. As a kid, I used to eat them out the can (I still do), or with yogurt or evaporated milk. There’s something so childish and comforting about them – really nostalgic. For me, it’s all about simpler times: sitting at my parents’ table after dinner, just me and my tinned peaches and nothing to worry about.This my most popular recipe. Some people think it’s weird, and then they try it – unanimously people love it. Originally, it was made from a food-bank box. I got a tin of chickpeas, a tin of tomatoes and a tin of peaches and I stood looking at them and thinking, “OK, I have to make a meal out of this.” Somewhere at the back of my brain, I remembered a chicken curry I used to have, and swapped the chicken for chickpeas and apricots for tinned peaches. When I wrote it, I had a weaning toddler, so I’ve increased the spices here. The peaches just melt away into the sauce. You can also blend the peaches with the tomatoes and you won’t notice them at all – they’ll just add a smooth sweetness.First drain your chickpeas and rinse them vigorously. Pop them in some fresh water in a saucepan and boil rapidly for 10 minutes to soften. Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Pour a little oil into a medium, heavy bottomed pan and add the onion and garlic, then the curry powder, and cook gently on a low heat for a few minutes to soften the onion. Don’t be tempted to turn the heat up – burned onions will permeate your whole curry, whereas sweating them will add a delicious sweetness.Drain the peaches, reserving the juice, and chop into small pieces. Add to the onion mixture in the pan, along with the reserved juice. By this time, the chickpeas should have finished boiling, so remove them from the heat and drain them, and tip them into the peaches-and-onion pan.Pour the chopped tomatoes in and crumble over the stock cube, then stir everything together. Reduce the heat to a low setting, and cook gently for 30 minutes. You may need to add a cup of water to the sauce if it starts to get a bit thick. Stir well, and serve.Will keep in the fridge, cooled and stored in an airtight container, for three days, or in the freezer for three months. Reheat to piping hot to serve.Jack Monroe is a cookery writer. Her new book is Good Food for Bad Days, published on 28 May (Bluebird) cookingonabootstrapTahini is a complete staple for all Greek Cypriots, I buy it in bulk, in massive 3kg tubs, and we have it with almost everything. Tahinopita – tahini cinnamon swirls – are my actual favourite things in the world, they are so delicious.And tahinosoupa is really simple, so delicious and nourishing. It only has a few ingredients: rice, lots of lemon, garlic, chickpeas and tahini. If you look at it, you’d think it was cream-based – because it’s so creamy. When I make it, I roast chickpeas, because I like having the texture on the top. I coat them with herbs and spices.I cannot resist a fresh tahinopita, and no matter how big it is (and you can get massive ones) I just can’t save any for the next day. If you can’t get hold of carob syrup don’t worry, just leave it out. It’ll still work brilliantly and will be delicious.Makes 4tahini (dark tahini if you have it) 200gcarob syrup 3 tbsp (optional)sugar 125golive oil 3 tbspground cinnamon ¼ tspfine sea saltbread flour 350g, plus extra for dustingbicarbonate of soda ¼ tspyeast ½ × 7g sachethoney 4 tbspPreheat the oven to 160C fangas mark 3.In a medium mixing bowl, combine the tahini, carob syrup (if using), sugar, 1 tablespoon of olive oil and cinnamon. Add a pinch of salt and leave to one side.In a large bowl, mix together the flour, bicarbonate of soda and ½ teaspoon of sea salt. Make a well and pour in the remaining olive oil. In a jug, mix together the yeast with 250ml of warm water. Pour into the flour well and mix everything together with a fork. Add a little flour or water as necessary to get the right consistency you want it to be smooth and elastic, not too sticky or firm.When the dough is ready, ide into 4 balls. Dust your worktop with flour.Roll one of the balls out into a rough circle to fit the palm of your hand. Hold it and spoon in 1 tablespoon of the tahini mixture. Seal together the dough to encase the tahini and press it flat onto the worktop with the palm of your hand to shape into a rough circle. Spoon in another spoonful of tahini, again seal the dough round it, and don’t worry if some starts to spill out. This can all be very rough – you just want to build up the dough and tahini layers.Guide the dough into a long sausage shape, use a knife to spread on a little more tahini mixture, then take each end in each of your hands and twist the sausage in opposite directions so it starts to twirl like a cheese straw. Roll the twirled dough into a spiral, tucking the end underneath, and flatten onto your worktop with the palm of your hand. Place on a lined baking sheet and repeat with the remaining 3 pieces of dough and the tahini mixture.When they are all ready, bake the tahinopites in the oven for around 20 minutes, until golden and cooked through. Drizzle immediately with honey and leave to absorb for 5 minutes before eating.From Taverna by Georgina Hayden (Square Peg)I love peanut butter. My mum was a pretty bad cook, so often peanut butter on toast would be preferable to her cooking. Mine is not a romantic cooking-with-mother story it was a necessity to be a chef.Now, I generally make my nut butter because it tastes a bit nicer than the stuff you buy, but I do also buy it. I use whatever nuts we have: peanuts, almonds or cashews. Walnuts can be a bit bitter, so I often add dates. Homemade nut butters are easy to make, they keep for at least two weeks in a sealed container in the fridge and taste delicious.I always have the ingredients for this cake at home. If you have any bananas that are getting a bit over-ripe, put them in the freezer, they will work well for this recipe. Feel free to experiment with any other nuts you have in the cupboard. Shop-bought nut butter works just fine here too.For the peanut butter (makes 200g)lightly roasted peanuts (or other nuts) 200gsea salt a pinchFor the cakebutter 80g, plus extra for greasingpeanut butter (or other nut butter) 100gcaster sugar 225gbananas 4 ripe, 3 mashed, 1 cut in half lengthwaysyogurt 85ml free-range eggs 2, whiskedunsalted roasted peanuts 50g, chopped (optional)plain flour 285g, siftedbicarbonate of soda 1 tspsalt ½ tspFirst make the peanut butter.

So, heat the oil over a very gentle heat and add the garlic cloves and the bay leaf. It should take about 20 minutes to colour the garlic, very slightly: it’s a warm bath, not a frying pan experience. Once cooked, remove the garlic and bay leaf. Set the cloves to one side (you’ll need them later).Turn the heat up to high. Season the chicken, add it to the pan and fry for 4 minutes before turning the pieces over – you want a nice crispy golden outside. Cook for another 4 minutes. Add the pimenton de la vera and the sherry vinegar give everything a good stir and leave to bubble gently for 5 minutes.Serve with olive oil and mashed potatoes. Spoon the mashed potatoes into the middle of a platter, place the chicken on top, and pour over the juices and the garlic.José Pizarro is the chef-owner of four restaurants and author of six books josepizarroI grew up eating rice three times a day. We had rice for breakfast, rice for lunch, rice for supper. If you have plain rice, cooked well, you can eat it with whatever you have in the cupboard, whatever you are cooking that day, with grilled meat or fish, vegetarian dishes, or leftovers.I usually cook rice in my rice cooker now, but many people don’t have one. The easiest way to cook rice is in one saucepan – the absorption method. I find basmati rice a bit too dry and jasmine rice a bit too soft, so I use half basmati, half jasmine.Serves 4 moderate rice eaterslong grain rice, white or brown 450gwater 570 mlPut the rice and water in a saucepan, put the saucepan on a moderate heat and bring to the boil. Stir once with a wooden spoon. Let the rice simmer, uncovered, until all the water has been absorbed. This will take about 10 minutes (brown rice, perhaps 15 minutes).To finish your rice the traditional way, keep it in the saucepan and put the lid on as tightly as possible. If the lid isn’t tight-fitting, you can put a layer of aluminium foil between the lid and the pan. A tea-towel is better still – it stops steam condensing inside the lid and dripping back into the rice. Turn down the heat as low as possible, and leave the rice to cook undisturbed for 10 or 12 minutes. (The time for brown rice is the same as for white.) Don’t take off the lid. Take the pan off the heat and set it on a wet tea-towel on your draining board. Leave the rice to rest for 5 minutes, still with the lid on. (The wet cloth will stop the bottom layer of rice sticking to the pan.) Then uncover the pan and put the rice into its serving bowl.With white rice, you will find that there is a layer of rice grains, about ½ cm thick, stuck together on the bottom of the pan like a thin cake. Don’t throw this away! In Indonesia, we call this rice cake intip. Dry it in the sun, or in the oven as if you were drying bread for breadcrumbs. Then break it into smallish pieces and store in an airtight container. When you have a worthwhile quantity, deep-fry the pieces of intip until they become golden brown. Sprinkle them with a little salt, and you have an unusual and delicious quick snack to serve with drinks. (With brown rice, the intip is so thin and brittle that you can just mix it in with the rest of the boiled rice.)If you don’t want to eat this crusty bottom layer of rice, don’t stand your saucepan on a wet cloth while it rests at the end of cooking. The bottom layer will then stick to the pan, and you can soak it off and throw the rice away.Here the boiled rice is served in a separate bowl and everyone can help themselves and mix it with their chicken adobo. I suggest you boil the rice while the chicken dish is cooking.For 4-6 peoplechicken 1.1-1.4kg, cut in pieces, the fat and skin discardedgarlic 6-8 cloves, finely choppedwhite vinegar or rice vinegar 112mlwater 1.1 litreskaffir lime or bay leaves 1 or 2coarsely ground black pepper or chopped chillies ½-1 tsp salt 1 tsppeanut oil 2 tbspground turmeric ½ tsppaprika ½ tspvery thick coconut milk 140ml fish sauce or light soy sauce 2 tbspplain, boiled long grain rice 450g (see above)Put the chicken pieces into a large saucepan, add the garlic, vinegar, water, kaffir lime or bay leaves, pepper or chilli and salt. Bring to the boil, cover the pan. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.With a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken pieces to a colander. Turn the heat up under the saucepan and boil the stock until it has reduced to half its original quantity. This will take about 20-25 minutes.Heat the oil in another saucepan and add the turmeric and paprika. Stir, and add about 6 tablespoons of the coconut milk. Stir once and put in the chicken pieces. Stir these until every piece is coated in the orange-coloured sauce. Pour in the reduced stock and the rest of the coconut milk. Bring the liquid to the boil and let it bubble gently, stirring often, for 10-15 minutes. Add the fish sauce or soy sauce. Adjust the seasoning, and serve hot, with the plain boiled rice. Any lightly cooked or stir-fried vegetable will make a suitable accompaniment.From The Rice Book by Sri Owen. A new edition will be published by Bloomsbury next yearOf the many non-perishable products in my pantry, anchovies top the list. (So-called white anchovies, boquerones, are delicious, but they are pickled and herring-like, so not suitable here.)I suggest giving all anchovy fillets, whatever their origin, a quick dip in tepid water, then blotting them on kitchen paper. This gives you a chance to examine them and remove any stray bones, the odd fin or scrap of skin. If you intend to use the fillets whole, to drape over a tomato salad, for instance, or halved hard-cooked eggs, let them marinate in a few tablespoons of good extra virgin olive oil. (The oil from the tin or jar in which the anchovies are packed is not very tasty, and often not olive oil.)A lovely garlicky anchovy vinaigrette is a very useful back-pocket recipe to have. It’s an ideal dressing for enes, radicchio or sturdy salad leaves. Try it with boiled asparagus, artichokes or cauliflower, or nearly any vegetable, cooked or raw. As for something else store-cupboardy, it can dress tinned white beans (or freshly cooked dried beans), or tinned tuna, or both in combination.Makes 120mlgarlic 2 cloves, mediumsaltanchovy fillets 4-6dijon mustard 1 tspred wine vinegar 2 tbsplemon juice 1 tbspextra virgin olive oil 6 tbspfreshly ground black pepper to tastePut the garlic in a mortar with a pinch of salt and pound to a smooth paste. (Alternatively, use a knife to mince the garlic, sprinkle with salt and smash to a paste with the side of the blade.)Slice the anchovies crosswise very thinly. Add to the garlic in the mortar (or put the garlic and anchovies in a small mixing bowl). Add the mustard, vinegar and lemon juice and whisk vigorously with a fork to break up the anchovies a bit and dissolve the mustard. Slowly whisk in the oil and add pepper (the dressing need not emulsify but it should be thick-ish). Taste and adjust seasoning.David Tanis is a chef and author of A Platter of Figs and Other Recipes, Heart of the Artichoke and Other Kitchen Journeys, and One Good Dish davidtanisThe nice thing with dried beans is that you can boil up a big batch at the beginning of the week, keep them in the fridge, and then do different things with them throughout the week – so you don’t get bored of one dish. You can have them with tinned tomatoes and whatever spices you’ve got, get creative with it. You can add them to a soup: kidney beans in borscht or in a Tuscan bean soup with cabbage. Blitz them up and make a bean hummus too.In west Ukraine, there’s a dish called shupenya. You boil soaked dried broad beans until they’re super soft, then crush and mix the beans through mashed potato. It can be eaten as it is, with crispy onion, herbs and sometimes lardo on top, or used as a filling for dumplings (shupenya) or baked buns (pyrizhky).Because potatoes and beans are quite similar in texture, they supplement each other very well. It is a very good way to bulk up your mash if, like us, you have a lot of beans but are running out of potatoes. Do not throw away the baked potato skins, they are great for flavouring simple vegetable broths, or fill them with some cream cheese or tuna mayo.Makes 8For the doughyogurt 250ml, or milk or waterfast-acting dry yeast 7g honey ½ tbsp fine sea salt ½ tsp sunflower oil ½ tbsp plain flour 400g, plus extra (you can use half wholemeal)For the fillingpotatoes 150g, unpeeledbeans (any beans) 1 x 400g tin, or 150g dried beans, soaked and cooked until very softfine sea saltsunflower oil 2 tbsp, plus extra for fryingonions 100g, peeled and slicedWhisk the yogurt or milk with the yeast and wait 10 minutes to make sure the yeast is alive (it will froth up). Then mix in the honey, salt and sunflower oil. Finally add the flour and give it all a good mix in the bowl. The dough might be a little wet, but don’t worry it will come together once it rises. Cover the bowl with a towel and leave for 1-2 hours or until the dough is double the size.For the filling, bake the potatoes whole for 40 minutes or until they are really soft inside. Scoop out the flesh and put it into a bowl. Do not throw the potato skins out, you can chop them into a veg broth.Mash the beans with the potato – a slightly lumpy texture is OK.Heat the 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil in a frying pan, add the onions, season them with salt to help release moisture and cook over a low heat, stirring from time to time, for about 20 minutes. Once the onions are caramelised stir them with the beans and potatoes. Season this well.Flour the surface and scrape the dough out onto it. Knead the dough, adding more flour if it is still sticky. The dough will be soft, and will eventually stop sticking.Preheat the oven to 180C fangas mark 4.Divide the dough into 8 parts. Flour a surface really well and roll each piece out into 10cm circles. Place about 50g of the filling into the centre of each dough circle. Bring the edges up and pinch them together to seal, then flip the buns seam-side down onto the floured surface. Place the buns side by side on a lightly oiled baking tray to rise for 30 minutes, covered with a towel. The buns will merge together as they rise, and as they bake.If you can, glaze with a little milk. Bake for about 20-30 minutes or until golden. They make for a very good lunch or breakfast.Olia Hercules is a chef and food writer.

There is new growth on the thyme bushes on the kitchen steps, the chives are poking through the soil and I found wild garlic leaves at the greengrocer’s the other day. New life in the garden and new season’s ingredients in the shops suddenly seem more welcome than ever.My collection of rice in the cupboard (brown basmati, sticky sushi, round white baldo, carnaroli and arborio) has been getting its moment in the spotlight in the past few weeks. Sticky rice for breakfast (with pickled radish and crumbled nori). Brown rice for lunch (vegetable stock with basmati and shredded spring carrots) and, twice now, white basmati rice for dinner (a vegetable coulibiac and a rosewater-scented biryani.) Last night it was the turn of the round and starchy arborio in a spring herb risotto.That last one was particularly uplifting. Maybe it was the simplicity of the rice, butter, stock, cheese and herbs, or perhaps it was the 20 minutes of peaceful stirring with a favourite wooden spoon that did the trick. Whatever, the young leaves lifted our spirits and left us with the promise that one day, all will be well again.There is something calm-inducing about a risotto. The gentle stirring, the warm, soft grains in your mouth and the idea that you have made dinner so effortlessly from so few ingredients. The crisps are obviously optional. I like the deep umami contrast to the pleasingly bland, softness of the rice. Serves 2For the parmesan crisps:parmesan 50g, gratednigella seeds 2 tspTo finish:salad leaves a handful of young leaves, such as red-veined sorrel, chives, chervil leaves or small beetroot leavesPour the vegetable stock into a saucepan. Strip the basil, parsley and tarragon leaves from their stems and put the stems into the stock. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and leave to simmer for 10 minutes, then remove from the heat and cover with a lid to infuse.Finely chop the onions. Put half the butter into a shallow-sided pan over a moderate heat, let it melt, then stir in the chopped onions. Leave them to cook, with a regular stir, for a good 10 minutes or until they are soft and translucent. Add the rice, then stir in the infused herb stock, discarding the herb stems as you go. Add no more than a ladle at a time, stirring almost continuously, until the rice is tender and the consistency is thick and creamy.In between stirring the risotto, make the parmesan crisps. Finely grate the parmesan, then mix it with the nigella seeds. Warm a nonstick frying pan over a low to moderate heat, place the grated cheese and nigella seeds in the pan in four rounds, each about the size of a digestive biscuit. Let the cheese melt, turn pale gold in colour and start to bubble. Remove the pan from the heat, let each disc of melted cheese cool slightly then remove from the pan with a palette knife or kitchen slice. This is most easily done by sliding the blade under the melted cheese and lifting it carefully from the pan. If it doesn’t come off easily, then leave it a minute or so longer until it is easy to handle. Put the crisps on a cooling rack.Chop the chives and the reserved herb leaves and stir into the rice together with the leaves of wild garlic, remaining butter and the grated parmesan. Check and correct the seasoning, then spoon generously on to plates or shallow dishes. Scatter over the small salad leaves and serve with the parmesan crisps.These little desserts freeze very well in a lidded, plastic box, and can be brought out at a minute’s notice.

Once the sugar has dissolved, remove the pan from the heat and set aside to infuse and cool.Place the lemons on a chopping board. Remove a quarter of each lemon by taking a slice from tip to stalk from each fruit. Using a lemon reamer or squeezer, remove the juice from each lemon. You need about 400ml of juice. Using a teaspoon, scrape out the skin and pulp from each lemon shell, then placed them on a tray and put them in the freezer.Pour the lemon juice into a blender jug, add the mint leaves and process for a couple of minutes until the leaves are very finely chopped.When the sugar syrup is thoroughly chilled, strain through a sieve to remove the mint stalks and stir in the juice. Pour into an ice-cream machine and churn until almost frozen. If you are making it by hand, pour the mixture into a freezer box and place in the freezer for 4 hours. Stir every hour to bring the frozen crystals around the edge to the middle. A regular stir will ensure an even texture.Place the frozen lemon shells on a large serving dish.

Maybe you are enjoying it – or maybe you are trying to put in a working day at a corner of the kitchen table, dreading the preparation of the next meal.I worked as a chef for almost 30 years. Although I am now a full-time writer, I haven’t managed to escape the kitchen: I am currently feeding four strapping adults. I don’t always enjoy cooking, but I have had so much practice that I can get a reasonable meal on the table without much fuss. Here are some of the things I have learned that might make your lives a bit easier.1 If you think your food isn’t tasty, it may be because many home cooks don’t use enough salt and pepper. Season as you go, taste, season again. You can’t get flavour into a shepherd’s pie by sprinkling a bit on at the table. You need to sort that before you assemble it.2 If a recipe says: “Cook the onions until they are translucent, about three minutes,” it is lying. It takes 10 to 15 minutes to achieve this. Meanwhile, it is likely they will start to colour, which leads me on to the next thing.3 Water is your friend. A splash will stop your onions from burning, thin that sauce, make that pastry rollable.4 When you cut an onion, it releases a vapour that reacts with the first wet thing it finds. If that happens to be your eyeballs, you will cry. If your knife is wet and you have rinsed the onion, you will cry less. I am not sure of the science, but I know that it helps.5 If you are going to roast or bake something for dinner, add a tray of veg for lunch the next day, or a cake. Cheaper and better for the planet.6 You may be baking with kids. Do not begin with scones. Like pastry, scones need the gentlest touch. Make bread, fairy cakes or a Victoria sandwich that will survive the assault.7 We are getting hardly any exercise and this could go on for weeks or months. Baking a cake with your kids every other day isn’t sustainable. Get them to help with actual meals. Small ones can roll meatballs or falafels, pick herbs, mash avocados.8 Older ones can use knives, peelers, graters. It is up to you to decide what age or which child my daughter was handy with a knife at seven or eight, but there are adults I wouldn’t like to see wielding a blade. If you have teenagers, tell them to get out of bed and make lunch.9 It is good to look in your fridge and come up with new dishes, but some combinations just don’t work. I was once served sardines with strawberry puree. It was muck. Mackerel with pickled rhubarb, on the other hand, was sublime. Think about what you are doing.10 Maldon is my favourite salt, but it is not cheap. Use any old salt for boiling pasta etc and use the good stuff when you will notice the difference.11 Don’t be afraid of heat. Most domestic stoves can’t reach the temperatures an industrial one can. As soon as you throw a steak, a chicken breast, a chop or a bag of mince on a pan, the temperature will plummet. You will be left with a pale, simmering stew rather than a burnished prime cut.12 When frying steaks, oil the meat, not the pan. This goes for cooking anything on a ridged grill pan, from halloumi to asparagus. And season after oiling or the salt will eat into the food.13 To clean a cast-iron pan, rub on salt with a piece of old tinfoil. When the food residue is gone, wipe a wee bit of oil on the pan to keep it from rusting. This is my father’s tip. He says reusing the foil “will keep that nice wee Swedish girl happy”. He means Greta Thunberg. He isn’t great with names.14 “From scratch” doesn’t mean you can’t take shortcuts. I can’t be bothered to roast and skinpeppers for romesco or muhammara. Lidl sells them in jars if you rinse them well, they work a treat.15 You are not cooking in a restaurant. Some dishes are impossible to recreate perfectly at home. Commercial pizza ovens are set at two temperatures: very hot on the bottom for a crispy base and cooler on top so as not to burn the cheese. Accept this or get a takeaway.16 Most restaurant cookbooks are for the coffee table. You are cooking your way through a lockdown. For the purposes of this exercise, foams and gels are for the bathroom. Getting an omelette and chips to the table is no mean feat.17 I worked in some decent kitchens, but never in one where we made vegetable or chicken stock. (The bubbling pot of what is known as “jus” is another story.) It is OK to buy them, although they vary quite a bit. Some taste too strongly of celery some contain gluten or MSG. Try them out.18 That said, I make chicken stock most weeks. I roast two chickens and serve one for dinner. The other I strip down for coronation chicken or a pie. I put both carcasses in a slow cooker overnight with water and aromatics then use the stock for soup, risotto, etc.19 Which aromatics? Onion, leek, carrot, celery, bay, thyme, parsley, black peppercorns. The trimmings of spring onions, fresh tomatoes, mushrooms. I rarely have all these at once and often make it with just onion and a bay leaf. A big no to garlic, starchy stuff like spuds or anything resembling cabbage. And I always add a single clove.20 Dress pasta, rice, potatoes and noodle salads when they are warm. Hot, they will absorb all the dressing. Cold, they will absorb none of it.21 I love my food processor, but I loathe cleaning it. I do dry stuff in it first – making breadcrumbs, chopping nuts – then wipe it with kitchen paper. Then I do any grating, chopping or slicing and rinse it before liquidising or pureeing.22 I keep root ginger in the freezer and leave it out for five minutes before grating. Then I freeze it again.23 Most chefs use chopped tinned tomatoes for cooking because the whole ones take so long to break down or need to be chopped or liquidised. They always need to be sweetened. Do it to taste, but go easy or there will be a ketchupy vibe.24 Use a serrated knife to slice fresh tomatoes. I have a small one that I use for lemons, too, or you can use a steak knife or the bread knife. Tomatoes will wreck your straight blade – blunt it almost immediately. I don’t know why, but they will.25 Chefs have this thing called mise en place, where all their ingredients are prepped and laid out in front of them before they begin. I am not recommending that you buy a set of identical glass dishes, but maybe consider getting all your chopping out of the way before you start and laying it in separate little piles on one big plate or tray.26 Some pastry chefs use crème pâtissière in desserts such as trifle. It contains a little flour and is easier and quicker to make – and less likely to burn than crème anglaise (runny custard).27 If you can find everything you want in the shops these days, you are doing better than me. Besides, supermarkets are traumatising now, with their bogging trolley handles and pandemic-yellow floor stickers. Make substitutions. I made a reasonable sort of hummus with butter beans. Rocket works instead of parsley. Cashews and walnuts are OK in pesto.28 You can switch ingredients when baking, but be careful. Baking is chemistry. The other day, I made brown bread, adding oat bran and milled chia seeds instead of the wheatgerm and wheat bran the recipe called for. It needed extra liquid, possibly because chia seeds are thirsty.29 At the end of each shift, chefs clean down every surface. Out of habit, I do this and have never had to use steel wool or strong chemicals on my hob. It is 13 years old and could pass for new. I am otherwise a slattern, by the way.30 Salt is controversial. So is sugar. If you are supposed to avoid them for medical reasons, then do so. Obviously. If you like your own cooking, keep doing what you are doing. These are not commandments, just the musings of a virus-freaked oldie.• The End of the World Is a Cul de Sac, Louise Kennedy’s debut short story collection, will be published by Bloomsbury in January 2021"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08a7ef07f2ad618f3ddc43b5526e78f5514cd18b/0_0_3022_1814/master/3022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93192265cbf0a73f0b083d61cda185d9","title":"from srloth to luis alberto 20 players who have thrived after leaving england","story":"These players, one from each Premier League club, may not have made much of an impression in England but have proven their worth elsewhereArsenal – Kristoffer Olsson (Krasnodar) In two years at Arsenal the Swede appeared in one matchday squad and made it on to the pitch for 36 minutes of a League Cup tie at West Brom (scoring in the penalty shootout). He moved on, initially to Midtjylland in Denmark, and after a spell at AIK in Sweden he joined Krasnodar in January 2019. This season he has been a key player in midfield, with his team second in Russia’s Premier League.Aston Villa – Pierluigi Gollini (Atalanta) A £4.25m signing from the Serie B side Hellas Verona in 2016, Gollini held down a first-team spot for barely four months before Steve Bruce brought in Mark Bunn, more than 10 years Gollini’s senior, before Christmas. “Bunn gives you that bit of experience,” he said. “I just felt with young Pier, it was a bit too much for him. I find him very young.” The following month he joined Atalanta, initially on loan, and he has been their first-choice goalkeeper since March 2019. He has had an outstanding season and made his full international debut in November.Bournemouth – Max Gradel (Toulouse) Not just an automatic first choice when fit but Toulouse’s captain, the Ivorian contributed 13 goals and 10 assists last season – his best statistics since the year at Saint-Étienne that convinced Bournemouth to sign him in the summer of 2015. He spent two seasons on the south coast, starting 11 league games in the first and none in the second. This season he has three goals and three assists in 21 appearances in Ligue 1.Brighton – Mathias Normann (Rostov) The then 21-year-old Norwegian signed in the summer of 2017, swiftly departed again on loan to Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s Molde. After returning for the first half of the following season he made a permanent move to Rostov in January 2019 without ever being considered worthy of a place in Brighton’s first-team squad. The defensive midfielder has been a regular ever since, starting all 18 league games he has been available for this season and finishing 17, scoring one (excellent) goal.Burnley – Rouwen Hennings (Fortuna Düsseldorf) The German striker made only three league starts, scoring one goal, at Burnley during the 2015-16 season. “We’re not expecting miracles out of him,” Sean Dyche said. “He’s shown signs and glimmers of what he’s about and we think there’s more to come.” There was, though nobody saw it until he had been sent back to Germany on a free transfer. He started this season spectacularly, scoring 10 league goals by the end of November and though he could not keep up that pace his tally of 11 puts him fifth in the Bundesliga scoring charts.Chelsea – Marko Marin (al-Ahli) Chelsea spent around £7m to sign the then 23-year-old midfielder from Werder Bremen in 2012. He had already won 16 full caps and been a member of Germany’s squad for the 2010 World Cup but the move did not work out: he made only two league starts and played a total of 142 league minutes before heading out on a series of loan deals. He eventually joined Olympiakos in 2016 for around £2.5m. Now 31 he moved to the Saudi club al-Ahli in January having captained Crvena Zvezda in the first half of the season, including every minute of the Serbian side’s Champions League campaign (they lost 5-0 and 4-0 to Spurs, and 3-0 and 6-0 to Bayern Munich, but he set up two goals in their one victory, at home to Olympiakos).Crystal Palace – Alexander Sørloth (Trabzonspor) The Norwegian praised “a big club with ambition, a good club who takes good care of its players” when he signed in January 2018 but after four games without a goal he was dropped, destined never to make another league start in England. But a player who scored only once in this country, against Swansea in the League Cup, has become the best marksman in Turkey, where he has scored 19 and created six in 26 appearances this season.Everton – Joel Robles (Real Betis) Between August 2013 and May 2018 the Spaniard spent 140 Premier League games on Everton’s bench and managed 39 starts. There were periods when he looked to have made the goalkeeper’s jersey his own but none was very long signed for £3.6m, he left on a free transfer and after spending last season as back-up at Real Betis he has stepped up following Pau López moved to Roma last summer.Leicester – Andrej Kramaric (Hoffenheim) The Croat became Leicester’s record signing for £9.7m in January 2015. “He’s an extremely talented young footballer,” said Nigel Pearson of the then 23-year-old. “He is potentially a very important addition to us.” That potential was never realised: he started five of next seven games and continued to make regular substitute appearances but spent only 22 minutes on the pitch in 2015-16. He joined Hoffenheim, initially on loan, almost exactly a year after his arrival. His five goals helped keep the club up that season and he made the move permanent in the summer of 2016. He has never left their first team, has scored 45 league goals in his three complete seasons and despite suffering several injuries had seven to his name when play stopped in March.Liverpool – Luis Alberto (Lazio) Liverpool spent £6.8m to sign the 20-year-old Spaniard, who could play across the forward line, in 2013, with Brendan Rodgers trilling “he has the correct footballing profile and mentality to be a Liverpool player”. He never started a league game, making nine substitute appearances, and never scored before joining Lazio three years later for £4.3m. He barely played in his first season but since 2017 has been a regular and this season, in a more withdrawn role at the base of midfield, has created 13 goals in 25 games – the most in Serie A – while scoring four of his own.Manchester City – Olarenwaju Kayode (Gaziantep) A curious one, this. The Nigerian had been Austria’s top scorer before City snapped up the then 24-year-old from Austria Vienna in the summer of 2017 for £3.5m. But he never played for the club, instead moving immediately on loan to Girona. After starting two league games and scoring no goals he was sent back again in January 2018, saw a move to Amiens collapse for “administrative reasons” and had a disappointing spell at Shakhtar Donetsk. He is now shining in Turkey, where he has nine goals and six assists this season.Manchester United – Guillermo Varela (Copenhagen) After signing in 2013 aged 20 Varela had to wait two years for a chance but under Louis van Gaal in 2015-16 the Uruguayan was integrated into the first-team, making regular appearances in league and cups. “He’s performing like he’s been playing for 10 years,” Juan Mata said. “He’s a very competitive guy, he’s good for the team so we are very happy for him.” Then he started against Liverpool in the Europa League, did too little to stop Philippe Coutinho’s run as he scored a brilliant goal just before half-time, was taken off at the break and never played again. He went on loan to Eintracht Frankfurt in 2016-17 but when a tattoo engraved against club instructions became infected before the cup final he was dropped, fined and sent back in disgrace. In 2017 he returned to his first club, Peñarol, but came back to Europe in January 2019 to join Copenhagen and was enjoying the best season of his career before play was suspended in March.Newcastle – Mikel Merino (Real Sociedad) During Merino’s single season at Newcastle his ability was evident but Rafael Benítez was not fully convinced by his Spanish compatriot. He managed only two league starts between the end of 2017 and the end of the campaign, because he was unable to dislodge Jonjo Shelvey and Mo Diamé in central midfield. He started 24 of 38 league games last season but 25 of 26 this year as Real Sociedad unexpectedly rose to fourth in the table.Norwich City – Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe (Gent) Norwich spent around £4.5m to sign the 25-year-old Belgium midfielder in the summer of 2014. He started only one league game as Norwich won promotion in his first year and three in the Premier League the following season before being allowed to join Legia Warsaw on a free transfer. He was Poland’s player of the following season but after one year moved to Olympiakos, where he experienced a chaotic campaign featuring three managers. In April was told by the club’s chairman – and owner of Nottingham Forest – Evangelos Marinakis that he had no future there. He joined Gent in the summer of 2018 and became the captain this season. He had scored three goals and created eight when play was suspended.Southampton – Martín Cáceres (Fiorentina) Cáceres had already played for Juventus and Barcelona, as well as winning 68 caps for Uruguay, before he joined the Saints as a free agent in February 2017. Of the 13 league games between his arrival and the end of the season he started 12 on the bench, finished 12 on the bench, and actually appeared only once, in a 2-1 victory at Middlesbrough that May. He has since been passed around Serie A clubs – from Hellas Verona to Lazio, to Juventus, and then last summer to Fiorentina, where has has started 20 of the 22 league games he has been available for. He turned 33 this month (7 April).Tottenham – Milos Veljkovic (Werder Bremen) Spurs spotted Veljkovic when the Serb was a 15-year-old at Basle and signed him a few weeks before his 16th birthday in 2011. He was at the club for nearly five years in which time he made three appearances, of two, 28 and four minutes’ duration respectively. Loan moves to Charlton and Middlesbrough were unproductive and in January 2016 he left for Werder Bremen, who paid around £500,000. He has made 97 league appearances there and is once again a mainstay in defence after recovering from a broken toe that kept him out of the first five games.Sheffield United – Aymen Tahar (Panetolikos) The Sheffield-born midfielder of Algerian extraction came through the club’s youth system but left in the summer of 2010 having made the first-team squad once and played a single minute of senior football in an FA Cup defeat by Hull City. When he joined Staveley Miners Welfare a future of globetrotting success seemed unlikely but a move to the Romanian side Gaz Metan Medias proved successful. He has since played for Steaua Bucharest (where he made three Champions League appearances, albeit in the qualifying rounds) and Boavista. He left Portugal last summer to join Panetolikos in Greece’s top ision and he has been involved in 20 of their 23 league games this season, all but three as a starter.Watford – Steven Berghuis (Feyenoord) The Dutch winger lasted one season at Watford, arriving at the age of 23, before moving to Feyenoord, initially on loan. Of 38 Premier League games he was in the squad for only 16, made appearances in nine and started none. This season he is the Ereisie’s joint top scorer and joint third on the list of assists.Wolves – Silvio (Vitoria Setúbal) One year, four starts and four managers was the extent of Silvio’s experience in England but he has gone on to become a key player with Setúbal in his native Portugal: this season he has missed one match through illness and played every minute of the other 23."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e68c52cc6bf89597b486552fbe4d93203c567e2/5_0_1098_659/master/1098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc7c1d7276019d69b6d8a4e4979dfe73","title":"midtjylland to offer fans parking tickets for big screen superliga experience","story":"The Danish side Midtjylland have installed giant screens in the parking lot of their MCH Arena to allow fans to watch matches from their cars when the Superliga resumes following its suspension for the coronavirus outbreak.In what the league leaders described as the best possible alternative to a full stadium, players inside the empty facility will also feel the presence of 10,000 fans with live footage of the car park screened inside the venue.“We’re working hard to create the best possible experience,” Midtjylland’s marketing director, Preben Rokkjaer, told the BBC. “The coronavirus does not change that, it just provides some other preconditions.”The club said more than 2,000 of their 12,000 parking spaces will be opened up around the club’s stadium and fans will also be able to access TV commentary through their car radios.

Now the new consortium set to take over from Mike Ashley is confronted by the demand for reform in virtually every sphere of the club. These should be their seven priorities …Despite some sizeable bets predicting Max Allegri, the former Juventus manager, is Tyneside bound, sources close to the takeover say there will be no kneejerk decisions. It seems Steve Bruce’s job is safe for now, even if he knows Rafael Benítez remains the unmentioned pretender. Amanda Staveley’s camp is close to Newcastle’s former manager and although it could cost almost £20m to extract the Spaniard – still adored on Tyneside – from his current posting in China, that fee will reduce with every passing month.Given the difficult context, Bruce has done a decent job this season and deserves respect and a chance to confound the doubters. Even so, the new owner will wonder if he possesses the necessary pulling power to fulfil their European ambitions by luring leading players to St James’ Park.The flawed policy of investing significantly only in players aged under 25 deemed to possess high potential resale value has led to an imbalanced squad low on experience in vital areas, particularly attack. Scouting and recruitment needs a thorough overhaul and the impending appointment of a director of football – someone is apparently earmarked for the role – should start addressing this. Removing the entire complement of scouts from furlough – which has left them unable to study video analysis of transfer targets – would be a start.Bruce’s squad is refreshingly committed but limited and requires infusions of quality if it is ever to be weaned off the cagey, counterattacking default mode that has virtually secured Premier League safety but hardly thrills spectators. Newcastle’s healthy balance sheet should dictate that, providing player investment is shrewd, financial fair play rules should not pose insurmountable recruitment barriers. More immediately, there is the pressing matter of what to do with players whose contracts end on 30 June. These include the highly rated 20-year-old local midfielder Matty Longstaff – the subject of considerable interest in Italy and Germany – the quietly influential full-back Javier Manquillo and the injury-prone Andy Carroll. Then there is are futures of three loanees, Danny Rose, Nabil Bentaleb and Valentino Lazaro, to consider.Thirteen years of Mike Ashley’s stewardship have left supporters disconnected and disenfranchised. The need to restore and reinforce the ties that bind represents an urgent priority. Through no fault of the club’s media team – they have, after all, being working for an autocratic owner – “no comment” has become the club’s soundtrack in recent years. Little is ever truly transparent in football but in Newcastle’s case increased openness is not only possible but required. Proper re-engagement with fans’ groups, local politicians and businesses is also needed in a city dominated by the footballing citadel perched on Gallowgate. Sources suggest the consortium plans to help fund urban regeneration and such projects would certainly win hearts and minds. Ditto, welcoming former heroes frozen out by the Ashley regime, most notably Keegan and Alan Shearer. Chris Mort, the lawyer acting for Staveley, served briefly as Newcastle’s chairman under Ashley he can certainly advise the consortium what not to do.When Ashley took charge in 2007, Newcastle’s commercial (non-broadcasting) revenue was on a par with Tottenham’s and only marginally behind Arsenal’s and Liverpool’s. Although the club has recorded an overall operating profit in seven of the past eight seasons, current income from commercial ventures – sponsorships, merchandising, overseas marketing – is almost identical to that commanded 13 years ago. This stasis is highlighted by the most recent set of accounts. These show Newcastle generated £26.7m in this sphere, around £80m a year less than Spurs. If revenue streams are to start flowing freely once more, ambition must be reignited and the commercial taps turned back on as the club’s global profile is restored.Although St James’ Park requires a little updating, it remains among England’s finest stadiums. Unfortunately, Newcastle’s cramped and old training ground is a different story. It has slipped well below Premier League standard and in the north-east alone League One Sunderland and Championship Middlesbrough possess infinitely superior weekday HQs. Might old plans originally proposed by Sir John Hall to transform the derelict Woolsington Hall and its extensive grounds near the City’s airport into a training groundnew academyluxury hotel complex be dusted down and revived? Whatever happens, appreciable investment, and new ideas, will need to be directed towards an academy arguably punching well beneath its potential weight.It would help if Newcastle had a proper executive structure. At present they are in the rare position of operating without a board, with Lee Charnley, the managing director, the club’s sole listed director.The extraordinary lack of debate and delegation characterising the Ashley era has to end but the many excellent, and dedicated, staff found in every corner of the club, and its charity foundation, must be cherished. Iniduals such as George Ramshaw, the seventysomething assistant kitman, are part of a precious fabric and symbolise Newcastle’s enduring heart and soul. They should all be de-furloughed.Becky Langley’s team reside in the fourth tier but a WSL top-flight place alongside Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City et al has to be the ultimate ambition.… And along the way revive memories of the exciting football played by Keegan’s entertainers and Sir Bobby Robson’s blue chip brigade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Light slants across wooden floors paintings and porcelain are arranged as if in a painting by Vermeer. For Hollmeyer, an art historian by training, those 17th-century artists excelled “at intimate scenes of everyday domesticity, where everything feels composed”.It’s an approach he’s applied here. The five-storey house, set on a shady garden square in south London, is Hollmeyer’s “canvas”. It’s where he takes a quiet pleasure in re-ordering books or piling a blue and white Delft bowl with fruit, like an artist tweaking a composition.As the name of his Instagram account, slightly_worn, suggests, it’s also a home that feels relaxed and unpretentious. There are deep sofas and burning grates upstairs for socialising and a large, eat-in kitchen in the basement for cosy suppers. Nothing is too “pristine or polished” in the house, which he discovered by chance in 2012. “I’d been looking for a bigger place with space to hang my paintings. My last home was in north London and I didn’t know this part of London at all. But I’d had supper with friends nearby and decided to explore,” he says.As he passed the house in Kennington, noting the fanlight and arched windows, a young man opened the front door, attached a “For Sale” sign to the railings and disappeared inside. When Hollmeyer rang up to inquire, he discovered that it was a private sale. “The family had lived there for almost 30 years. One son wanted to be an estate agent, so his father had told him to have a go at selling this house.” A gentlemanly deal was struck. Three weeks later, he moved in.Growing up in the Netherlands in the 1980s, Hollmeyer remembers how the old masters were omnipresent. Girls with pearl earrings peered out from wine coasters and “nearly every living room had a Rembrandt poster”. When he was a teenager the family moved to Amsterdam, where he became fascinated by its neo-classical architecture. “William and Mary brought that style to England. So you could argue that Georgian architecture owes a debt to them.”This stucco and brick-fronted house has that mix of “classicism and austerity” that he has always found so appealing. But over the centuries, original 1790s details had been masked by overzealous refurbishments. During his research, Hollmeyer, who is half Dutch and half German, discovered the square was built for workers at the nearby Bethlem Royal Hospital asylum (now the Imperial War Museum).“By the 19th century this was a slum, marked in black on the map. In the 1930s, the council bought most of the square by compulsory order. This house was one of a pair laterally converted into flats.” Georgian features – shutter boxes, skirtings, architraves – were ripped out. When Hollmeyer arrived, there were pine fireplaces, textured wallpaper and carpet-smothered stairs.“I’ve restored the house in stages as everything is so expensive,” he says. “At one point I ran out of money, so I stopped.” When he discovered a slice of original cornice, the builders were able to create a mould and recast it. The dado rail was reinstated and floorboards sanded and washed a light grey. For authenticity, Hollmeyer turned to historic buildings expert Tim Whittaker of the Spitalfields Trust. “He visited and drew up designs for the shutter boxes and architraves.” On the first floor, the library at the back has new panelling and a deep cornice. It too “feels very Dutch”.There were other discoveries. While the builders set to work to redecorate the top-floor bedroom, they uncovered the weighty beam that runs from front to back. For decades, it had been completely obscured by a false ceiling. “I found out that it’s a ship’s timber from Chatham dockyard. Good wood was very expensive in those days. So when ships were decommissioned the timber was sold to housebuilders.” He points out the grooves along its length. “It’s likely that they were cut to support decking.”Apart from the neoclassical trompe l’oeil wallpaper in the bedroom, he has kept the decoration simple, scattering rugs and painting walls. In the first-floor drawing room, the long-suffering decorator tried three different shades before Frank hit on the ideal green: “Not too leafy, not too cooking apple.” Its depth acts as a foil for the 17th-century Dutch paintings – portraits, still lifes, landscapes – which Hollmeyer has bought at auctions over the years. Working from home during lockdown, he’s had plenty of time to absorb their details.“Acquaintances have become friends,” says Hollmeyer, who also learned how to restore their gessoed frames using Dutch gilding. He’s grown even fonder of his brown furniture, the stately wingback armchairs or the wavy, camel back sofa with its “patina of time”. He’s recovered them in plain, thick linens. There are no curtains anywhere. “Like the window tax in England, the Dutch imposed a tax on curtains in the 17th century, so they were a rarity. I’ve stayed faithful to that look.”In the basement, he designed the country house-style kitchen, adding a butcher’s block found online. Instead of conventional flagstones, there are French tomette tiles. Their subdued, pinkish tone is, he says, “very Dutch”. When a more normal social life resumes, he’s looking forward to laying the table for guests. There will be tulips in vases, bright Meissen plates and his signature prop: the lemon.“All you need is one for a splash of colour. It’s an instant Dutch still life – on a budget.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63e9fffc6798d7b54542d7989a4e9c5f06d9bc96/0_482_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cb5deff8d493cb3d1f095862e9d634c","title":"how tv news hosts get camera ready in lockdown","story":"Broadcasters are falling back on their own skills to stay well-groomed. Unless, of course, it’s Robert PestonAs grooming pages have filled with how-to hacks for eyebrows, root touch-ups and manicures, and celebrities and influencers post tips on social media, the pandemic has inspired a surprising number of beauty trends from buzzcuts and pink hair to nail art.But while many use the hours at home to experiment, one section of the workforce is expected to maintain standards. TV news viewing figures have doubled as the public look to trusted faces to explain the latest Covid-19 developments. That trust comes with expectations.“In a time of crisis, maintaining normality where possible is important,” says fashion historian Amber Butchart. “We expect newsreaders to look professional, and a well-groomed look – for men and women – helps maintain our sense of order. For men, the suit is so ubiquitous that it is practically invisible – in 2014 Australian TV anchor Karl Stefanovic wore the same blue suit for a year to see if anyone noticed. He was highlighting the sexism his female colleagues faced, and he was right to – women in public life continue to be judged for their clothing to a much greater degree than men.”Cathy Newman, presenter of Channel 4 News, says the public have made little comment about her appearance since lockdown started. “I’ve had loads of lovely remarks about the journalism. People stop me in the street and tell me how grateful they are for the stories we’re sharing every night.”Newman’s camera-ready look is still down to the dedicated Channel 4 grooming team. “Lisa, our head of makeup, put together foundation, cover-up, mascara, blusher and every brush under the sun for each presenter. It was incredibly thoughtful. Lisa’s colleague, Amelia, even labelled every brush so I didn’t put eyeshadow on with the foundation brush.”She believes that, whatever the circumstances, presentation does count. “People watch Channel 4 News in their millions on TV and online, so I think it’s important to do them the honour of looking smart. Also, we have an hour of television every night. It’s quite an event, and dressing up for it adds to that sense of occasion. I even wear heels when I’m presenting from home as it psyches me up for the programme.”It remains to be seen whether the conventions of news reporting change as lockdown continues. ITV political editor Robert Peston has already made new rules for his home broadcasts. “I have always been a bit of a mess on camera,” he admits. “I have persuaded myself no one really minds whether I shave or not. And, of course, it is really great that no one can possibly know how long it is since I last showered.”Peston is also immune to video-conferencing paranoia. While most of us cringe at revealing our homes to work colleagues, Peston has cheerfully let the country in. “Though my partner, Charlotte Edwardes, is a bit annoyed that our bare light bulbs, piles of books and dilapidated sofa have been revealed.”Will he take advantage of lockdown to experiment with some of the new beauty trends – a buzzcut or a pink dye job? “Definitely not. At last I have a perfect excuse for the superannuated hippy look.”Maybe the news will look different by the time lockdown lifts after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e64dadc743cb50e3dc84b10fb74b592faa23311b/0_0_5087_3054/master/5087.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1310be9febd37b0d549e58e9ddeca8e5","title":"journalism coronavirus press google news","story":"The government, public and tech giants such as Google must find ways to support the news industryIt doesn’t seem that long ago that emergency relief funds were used to help people crushed by natural disasters now the world’s biggest search engine has launched one to save journalism.So dire has been the impact of Covid-19 on the news industry that Google announced plans to pay up to the “low tens of thousands” to newsrooms around the UK. Given the scale of the crisis, which comes after years in which Google itself has been the cause of so much disruption, this is like throwing a few planks of wood to those in the middle of a tsunami.Fears over the future of news in a digital ecosystem, in which fakery and clickbait thrives, are nothing new but this crisis has put matters into sharp relief. A virus could deliver the final blow to parts of an industry already struggling with a failed market.A Conservative government that has already nationalised railways and declared journalists to be key workers during this crisis looks set to step in. Last Thursday media minister John Whittingdale met industry figures to discuss the way forward.If journalism is to be saved as an essential public good a lot more needs to be done – not just by government with public money, but by the technology companies that have benefited from a disfunctional market and by the newspaper industry itself, too.For a start, the news industry must prove why a legacy in print media justifies any kind of special treatment: it can do so by providing the kind of news and information a democracy deserves and requires. We may all dislike different newspapers, and indeed columnists, but the journalism that makes a real difference – from the Windrush scandal to the murder of Stephen Lawrence to MPs’ expenses – costs money, but in the current system dominated by global tech giants, the market is failing to support it.There will be a long and no doubt bitter debate about what constitutes good journalism. The industry has a code of conduct, but for too long it hasn’t been properly adhered to. In the post-Covid world, when the news business needs to prove its credentials, that should no longer be the case.Google, Facebook, Apple and Twitter share much responsibility for the mess we’re in – their executives have spent years dismissing news journalism as this era’s fax machine, while pocketing large amounts of money from the content it provides. Digital newsroom initiatives and paid-for research do nothing more than put a shiny gloss on that fact.The very idea of state intervention – last mooted in February 2019 by the Cairncross Review into newspapers – is likely to cause outrage among both those in the industry who see it as an attack on the fourth estate, and those who don’t believe journalism deserves public funding.Neither major newspaper groups nor the government supported calls in the Cairncross review for a public institute for news. I spoke to Frances Cairncross, who led the report, to talk about the current crisis. “The pressures are so imminent and so powerful that there is a danger that much that is good and would otherwise have survived, will be destroyed,” she says.There are immediate things which could be done and are likely to win support from both an industry opposed to all state intervention – and a Thatcherite such as Whittingdale. For a start, the government could use public money to pay for local advertising, not just for its own messages but to support local industries currently closed by the lockdown. Denmark, like many Nordic countries, has a history of state support for journalism more or less replacing newspaper advertising with public money this year. Bringing forward VAT tax reliefs announced in the budget and allowing newspapers to claim business rates relief, even though they must keep operating, are other possible measures.These are small beer compared with the sort of public funding first recommended by Cairncross and backed by the NUJ. It is surely time to at least consider longer-term support.The big questions are where this money comes from and what kind of journalism it will support. Using public money to support journalism which has long been diminished by greedy owners will be as bad as allowing online platforms to rip up the basic compact of news.The NUJ’s windfall tax on digital groups is also a good idea but will it be sustainable? Surely an ongoing rearrangement of the way content is paid for online via licensing agreements would be better.Faced with historic demands on the public purse it will be true to form if the current government looks to the BBC to help out. This would be a mistake and could prove unpopular. Having delayed payments from the over-75s and stepped up its public service offering with education and more during the pandemic, the BBC faces a cash-strapped future of its own. It would be a travesty if it’s now forced to help local news even more, having stumped up the £150m cost for the Local  Democracy Reporting Service already.The post-Covid world is likely to see less money for everyone, of course, with the exception of Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. We will all need to work out what needs supporting with limited resources. Even discussing state support for journalism shows how far the news business has fallen. But if we accept that journalism is vital to society, and the current economic model doesn’t work, then something must be done, not just by the government but by all of us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d86a5b4a97e6227c859d43b52633cc09cea1484/0_130_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bcd90993a5f9a7f1654366c74b73560","title":"from travel to shopping to who pays for home working what you are asking around lockdown","story":"Our consumer columnist’s inbox continues to overflow. Here’s she answers some of your questionsMy flight was cancelled two days before departure and the airline is offering refunds, but as I booked through an agent, I checked the reservation on its website. The flight is still showing as confirmed with no way to claim a refund. I can’t access the online help centre – the phone number just cuts you off. How can I get my money back?Apply directly to the airline because that’s who your contract is with when you buy flights through a third-party booking platform. Airlines are prone to batting passengers back to the agent they booked through, but hold your ground. “The law is clear that the refund must be provided by the airline that was going to operate the flight and not the company that sold the flight,” says Coby Benson of Bott and Co. “If an airline cancels a flight they are obliged to provide a full refund within seven days, or a free replacement flight at a later date (subject to availability). If passengers are not given the option of a refund then they should telephone customer services or put their request in writing, keeping copies.”If the airline is offering refunds, you’re lucky. The travel industry has ripped up the rule book, so far with impunity, in the wake of coronavirus and most carriers are now only offering credit notes to be used for future bookings.My son, who normally does not live with me, has moved back in, to “work from home” because he doesn’t have broadband at his house. Am I entitled to some sort of payment from his employer for providing internet, electricity, heating and facilities? I feel I am supporting an international telecoms company whose office overheads are now minimised. Apparently, staff have been told they will not be compensated because they are not paying travel costs.If the employer can’t, or won’t, pay expenses to its employees you don’t have much hope there, although employers are allowed to pay staff £6 a week tax free to those obliged to work from home during lockdown.However, HMRC has said it will consider claims from employees whose bosses won’t contribute. It’s nothing to get excited about. Your son can claim tax relief on £6 a week, worth £1.20 - £2.40 a week depending on his tax rate. If he tried to claim any more than that, he’d have to provide evidence. The internet is a non starter, though, since you’re paying for it anyway.Should your son wish to return home, he could claim the cost from his employer of taking out a broadband contract if it was specifically for work. Hopefully, he’ll then pass on the riches to you.I bought a coat back in the good old days of last month when high streets were open. It doesn’t sit well on me and I meant to return it, but had to self isolate for 14 days, during which time stores were ordered to close. What happens to the right to return during lockdown?For starters there is no statutory right to return unless the item is faulty or not as described. Refunds for a change-of heart or a mistaken size are offered as goodwill by retailers to keep shoppers coming back.That said, if returns were offered at the time of purchase, the option forms part of your contract with the retailer. Stores are still allowing customers to return unwanted stuff, but most have changed their policies.High street names are mostly requiring customers to wait until stores reopen. John Lewis, for instance, will honour returns for store purchases made on, or after, 18 February 2020 for up to 35 days after lockdown ends, although it will allow a further grace period for customers who have been self isolating.M\u0026ampS has extended its deadline to 90 days until further notice and will accept postal returns, while ShoeZone is allowing its customers 12 months. Shops are also extending the expiry date of gift cards by up to two years.I have a package holiday to Croatia booked with TUI for departure on 27 June. I have paid £400 deposit but the final payment of £3,297.96 is now due. I am apprehensive about making this payment when it seems highly unlikely that this holiday will take place.If I were to pay in full, I would receive a full monetary refund and not just a voucher against any future TUI holiday. But if I fail to settle the final sum, TUI will cancel the holiday and my initial deposit will not be refunded. Telephone contact is proving practically impossible with excessive wait times of hours, not minutes, and it seems there is no way to make electronic contact via the TUI website.Since your holiday has not been cancelled (not yet, anyway) you’d be unwise to withhold payment at this stage. If you failed to pay up, you are likely to be in breach of contract and would indeed risk forfeiting the deposit, or even being sued for loss of revenue, according to Aman Johal, director of Your Lawyers.You’d have no chance of claiming on any travel insurance, either, if you were the one to cancel. TUI, which has only cancelled holidays due before mid May, is, however, offering holidaymakers with departure dates before 30 June to rebook for a later date without charge. The due date for the balance would then move, too.Otherwise, TUI says, holidays after 15 May are currently due to go ahead as normal and the balance must be paid. Following criticism, it has agreed to refund customers whose holidays are cancelled, but some tour operators are insisting on credit notes in the hope the government will amend the rules.Currently, Package Travel Regulations which govern any trip where two or more components are booked together, require a refund to be issued within 14 days if a tour operator cancels a trip. ABTA is lobbying ministers to extend the refund deadline to 31 July and to protect credit notes issued in lieu of cash.Meanwhile, it’s taken matters into its own hands. Until recently ABTA’s website promised any credit notes that are not redeemed by the end of July can be swapped for a refund now it states that refunds can be claimed after they expire. It says: “Refund credit notes should include an expiry date which is based on the travel company’s financial protection arrangements. The coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented, evolving situation and ABTA originally gave a 31 July deadline to provide some much needed structure. ABTA will contact any ABTA member if it regards the company’s actions as being in breach of its Code of Conduct,” ABTA says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88a1b3f3e54f2f3f94bc4d94fbac2e3432c1e1d4/0_1254_3790_2273/master/3790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bb6dd2cdf2f8eb1d4463b0dca4a7a68","title":"anne marie i just want to make people smile","story":"She’s one of Britain’s most effervescent pop stars. But there’s a lot more to Anne-Marie than her amazing voice. The singer talks about her battles with anxiety and body image – and the unexpected pleasures of lockdown after years on the roadThe pop star Anne-Marie has squirrelled herself away in an alcove, in a corner of a café in south London. It is the middle of February, and she has been working in a studio around the corner, on her second album, and now she’s picking at a veggie breakfast, though it’s three in the afternoon. Her formerly blonde, newly pale-pink hair lights her up like a beacon, but I have arrived a little early, and she looks so quiet and self-contained, so tucked into herself and thoughtful, that I have a strong urge to turn around and leave her to it. I had heard she was a talker, expected the gregarious character that is larger-than-life in her videos, but my first impressions are that perhaps she won’t be much of a talker at all.So, Anne-Marie is a talker, after all. She is three percent Irish, five percent Scottish, a little bit Scandinavian, and as for the rest, “I’m just Essex, basically,” she laughs.Breakfast over, she talks and talks, and she is open and unfiltered. At one point I ask her if she ever feels the need to keep anything back for herself. “I haven’t thought about that,” she says, surprised it might be an option. “I think the reason I’ve been able to even carry on doing this career is because I am so honest and I want people to know who I am. That’s been a great thing for me, rather than, you know, acting like someone else.”At the age of five, Anne-Marie went to a dance school, which sent her to auditions and for a while she had a part in Les Misérables in the West End. Then she switched focus and became a teenage international karate champion before going back to music, taking up songwriting, and ending up as one of Britain’s biggest pop stars. Speak Your Mind was the biggest debut album of 2018.When we meet, she is a month shy of turning 29, and has just released the single Birthday, currently clocking 16m views on YouTube. It’s an arms-in-the-air, get-your-mates-on-the-dancefloor smash about celebration, even if you’re broke, feel sad and thoughts of your ex are hanging around like a pungent aftershave. Her everywoman candour and knock-you-down vocal range have combined into a formula that she has spun into pop gold.She is working away at the new album, version two, with a confidence that had previously eluded her. She has struggled to write songs because of her self-doubt and, even now, when she’s in the studio with people she has written with before, “I almost feel like they don’t believe in me.” She is starting to realise that it’s self-sabotage – all imagined. “It’s actually me in my own brain.” She has suffered with anxiety for a long time, has always been a people-pleaser and admits she longs to be liked. “What I want to do in life is make people happy. Every day I wake up and say, ‘I’m going to make people smile.’” Along the way, she neglected to work out how to please herself.Anne-Marie started working on her own music when she was a teenager. “I didn’t spend time downstairs with my family. It was: in my room, put the CDs on, film myself singing, get better at singing, do that bit again. I think the passion for that overcame the bad bits.”Her first hint of the spotlight arrived in 2014, when Rudimental took her on tour as a vocalist, and she sang with the band for two years. When her own music started to pick up speed, she toured with her friend Ed Sheeran, and did vocals on Clean Bandit’s Rockabye, which became the Christmas No 1 in 2016. When her debut album took off, in 2018, she turned out snappy platinum hit after hit.As she became more successful, her anxiety grew. “It got worse when I became an artist. I was like, ‘Great,’” she says, dryly. “It got overwhelming.” She describes how it manifested as “just, preventing things that were easy. Little things, like going into a room full of people, I wouldn’t be able to do that. I’d have to get people to go in first, so everyone would look at them, then I could go in second.”It was an exhausting period, not just because of her workload. “I just thought I was a weirdo. I didn’t understand myself. Then I found out it was anxiety, and I felt better as soon as I said it, as other people could understand.”She traces it back to having a tough time in her teens. “I think I really started to struggle when I was in Year 8 or 9, and that just came down to me being a prick, to be honest. I became a horrible teenager, the worst kid you can have as a parent.” Even now, she feels the need to keep apologising to her parents for how angry she was, and how much she took it out on them. “My nan passed away when I was 12 and I think that affected me really badly.” They had been close. “She held us all together.”There was another catastrophe, a far more teenage one but a significant one, nonetheless. When she started secondary school, she’d been popular. “And I loved it! I was going out with all the boys, and one would come up to me and say, ‘I want to go out with you,’ and I’d be like, ‘All right, I’ll dump him and go out with you.’ It wasn’t until I was with someone for a long time…”There’s a pause. “Yep. I cheated on him with another boy and that changed everything. From then, everyone hated me.” Her friends stopped speaking to her, overnight. It seems so insignificant now, she admits. “But at the time, it was massive. I never told my family anything about it, because it’s almost embarrassing that people don’t like you. I’d go home and pretend I’d had a good day.”Sometimes girls would talk to her out of school, then at school they would blank her, which left her with long-standing trust issues. “Honestly, until I had hypnotherapy, I had struggled with everyone I’d met, even the people in the label. They’d be like, ‘We’re on your side, we want the best for you.’ I was like: ‘Fuck off, you don’t!’” It sounds as if she was bullied. “Well, do you know what? At one point I guess it was that. But I also think I was a really sensitive person. I find it hard saying that word, ‘bullying’, because in the end, I feel bad for the people I’m calling a bully.”Anne-Marie is close to her family she recently moved back to Essex from London, just to be nearer to them. When she’s away on tour, she calls her mum and dad all the time, a trick she picked up from Ed Sheeran. She asked him for the one crucial piece of advice that he’d give to someone new to the music industry. “He said, ‘Call your mum and dad every day.’” Otherwise, she explains, they only see what everyone else sees. “And you want them to know everything else.” Her dad is a builder and handyman, and her mum a teacher – they’ve been together since they were teenagers, which has given Anne-Marie an idealised view of love.“I thought that was what everyone was like,” she laughs. “I thought the first person I was with, that’s my husband. It made me intense! So the boys were like, ‘Eurgh, get away, we just want to have fun!’” She always wanted to get married, but now she’s older, and has seen a few friends’ relationships break down, she’s not so sure. “It just opened my eyes. Now I’m completely the other side. I’m not bothered.”That disappointment in a romantic ideal comes out again and again in her songs. “I felt like the moment I started to write songs, even if they were really shit, I was being myself, and that’s what I loved about songwriting.” But even when Speak Your Mind got as big as it did, she questioned her abilities. “When I first started writing, I couldn’t write, so I think I never grew out of that. It’s like when I lost weight, I never really grew out of thinking that I was still the chubby Anne-Marie, you know what I mean?”She was 19 when she started feeling “chubby”, she says. “I just ate loads. It wasn’t until a year later and I saw one of my exes at a pub, and he was like: ‘You’re looking healthy’.” He made me look at myself, and then I went the complete opposite direction and had a problem with eating.” Now, she is much more sanguine, at least when it comes to her body. “I just decided, do you know what? I’m just going to see what my body is supposed to be, go to the gym, feel healthy and whatever the shape my body comes out, that’s just what I’m supposed to be.”There was another change, too. After her career had taken off, she started to question why she never felt present, in the moment. “I just felt like I wasn’t actually here,” she says, trying to explain it. She was so unsettled by the sensation that she went online to see whether she might be having a breakdown. There was an interview she did in Australia, at 27, when she was told everything changes when you get to 28. “I’ve always felt I was 20,” she explains. “I felt I was growing up, but not actually growing up. Then when I became 28, I was like, oh shit, I’m 28!” She laughs. “I don’t know if it was what she said that made it go into my brain, or if it actually is a thing that when you’re 28, you change, but I was sitting in my living room one day, and I just cried my eyes out.”At the beginning of April, I give Anne-Marie a call to see how she’s coping with lockdown: “I’m a bit of a germ freak anyway, so it’s heightened everything,” she says, from her bedroom at home. She tells me she’s been on tour or working for seven years, so this is the longest she has been in one place for ages. “I honestly have never been so close to my friends and family at this point. We started on Houseparty and we have a schedule of what we do every day. On Monday, we have bingo. On Tuesday, we have a DJ night, so one of us plays music. Wednesday is quiz night. Thursday is Fitness Thursdays. Friday is Teach-Me Friday. Then Saturday is Quarantine’s Got Talent. So we’ve got a whole schedule.”As well as enjoying having more time to herself, she’s still feeling the benefits of the hypnotherapy she had. “After it, I thought, how the hell had I been making other people happy, when I wasn’t?” she says. She’s still a people-pleaser, but now she feels better about that, too. “I know how good it feels to feel good,” she explains, happy, for now, in the moment.Anne-Marie’s single, Birthday, is out on AsylumMajor Toms"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c294e36c5165ec3ea1f087eda026e644bb5f0a3/0_63_2000_1201/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a544d5d8df155ac5a1a4ceab02b79bff","title":"eob earth review radiohead ed obrien debut album","story":"“I’m not a Ronaldo or a Rooney: that’s Thom and Jonny,” said Radiohead’s second guitarist, Ed O’Brien, in 2008. “But in my dreams I’m a Paul Scholes.” Thirty-five years in the same band leaves a lot of dream time – particularly when your bandmates are on to their second or third acclaimed releases with various solo, soundtrack and side projects – and O’Brien’s debut album, worked on since 2012, finally gives free rein to the creative playmaker behind his unassuming, dedicated team-player persona. Earth, inspired by Carl Sagan and Screamadelica, is eclectic, its shapeshifting songs spinning through folky ambience, euphoric electronics and pulsing dance-rock.It’s best when subtlest – the brooding Mass, its guitars a tense electrical crackle – worst when, as on Deep Days, it recalls Badly Drawn Boy or millennium U2. “Vanity project” would be a cruel name for such a genuine album, but if O’Brien was someone else, it wouldn’t have been produced by Flood, released by Polydor, or feature Portishead’s Adrian Utley, Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche or, on the closing folksy duet Cloak of the Night, Laura Marling.

On the plus side, Mick Jagger’s taste in floral curtains is rather chic, and John Legend’s house has the desert-modernism aesthetic down pat. In an act of elite-level passive aggression, Elton John has plonked a piano in the middle of his outdoor basketball court, presumably to stop his kids driving him mad during lockdown with endless attempts at three-pointers.All this ogling is not really in the spirit of the event, which is a deeply earnest appreciation from the stars for essential workers, their performances interspersed with coverage of the fight against the virus, and shows of support from Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama and others.It begins with six hours of online livestreamed performances along with calls to donate to the WHO’s Solidarity Response Fund, before the star wattage intensifies for the TV broadcast and the tone changes. “Put your wallets away,” Gaga says. “It’s our love letter to the world – the incredible artists we’ve got lined up for you, they’re all here to say thank-you, to celebrate you, to give back a little bit of kindness that you’ve given to us.” For the UK, there’s a tweaked version of the package, featuring a higher proportion of Brits including Paul McCartney and Tom Jones, plus social media montages of stars including the athletes Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis-Hill. There is of course a rather luvvie-ish tendency on show here, that the world will be soothed with the ine gift of song the weariest health workers watching might have preferred a donation of funds for PPE rather than pop power couple Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello thinking to themselves what a wonderful world it is, no matter how gorgeous and gorgeously harmonised they are.But these performances are often beautiful and display rare gifts. Stevie Wonder’s medley of Bill Withers’ Lean on Me with his own Love’s in Need of Love Today is a robust double-helix of solidarity. The Rolling Stones’ rendition of You Can’t Always Get What You Want is superbly intimate, Jagger’s big-hearted vocals juxtaposing perfectly with Keith Richards’ Tom Waits-esque murmurs: stoicism and caution in a brotherly duet. Jennifer Lopez isn’t generally thought of as a balladeer, but her performance of Barbra Streisand’s People is Broadway-powerful, and its subject matter – humility in crisis – makes it perfectly chosen. Elton’s performance of I’m Still Standing is less good, delivered in the clipped “club style” of Shooting Stars.Among the new generation, Billie Eilish is typically spellbinding. She picks out Sunny by Bobby Hebb, an infectiously joyful tune, but while the lyrics face forward into brightness and joy, the way Eilish performs it – using her sensual, high-frequency vibrato – acknowledges the pain that came before. Burna Boy’s song African Giant – “Tell em Africa we done dying” – deftly rebuts the narrative of desperate African strife that has dominated all-star benefit shows in the past, and Taylor Swift’s moving performance of Soon You’ll Get Better, originally written for her unwell mother, will no doubt have powerfully resonated with those whose family members are currently stricken. The line “This won’t go back to normal, if it ever was”, takes on a quiet political edge, too.The BBC’s package of the material slots it into a shiny-floor studio format ably presented by Clara Amfo, Claudia Winkleman and Dermot O’Leary, the latter dressed to audition for a porn parody of the Steve Jobs documentary. The music takes a more soundtracking role with plenty of heartwarming montages of British health workers, bin men and more. There’s also a wonderful sequence where Skip Marley plays his grandfather Bob’s I Wanna Love You as a surprise first dance song for an NHS nurse who had her wedding cancelled because of the crisis – Richard E Grant plays best man, with Nadiya Hussain as cake provider.Paul McCartney’s Lady Madonna is jazzily interpreted almost to the point of incoherence, but he and Tom Jones give evocative personal tributes to the NHS, with Jones remembering his own isolation at the hands of tuberculosis as a child. Michael Bublé – whose young son was treated for cancer in 2016 – delivers a rightly sentimental take on God Only Knows for health workers, but it’s Little Mix who are the best of the Beeb exclusives with a perfectly harmonised version of Touch. Their melancholic take on a track that’s about being ragingly horny hints at a painful side of self-isolation that only a pop song could address in this family-friendly format. K-pop super-boyband SuperM are charming, indulging in lockdown pursuits like exercising, drawing, building a model ship and cooking some rubbish-looking bruschetta as they sing the comment feed duly explodes into heart emojis. But it’s Italian star Zucchero who steals the show, covering Everybody’s Gotta Learn Sometimes on piano. The Korgis’ song is about the loss of innocence at realising the sheer power of love, but in this context is charged with something even deeper: the pain of grief and the inevitability of death.Although it’s celebrating the work of the WHO, no one comes out to denounce Donald Trump’s defunding of the organisation Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder edited out the government-bashing lyrics in his otherwise extremely powerful rendition of River Cross. Perhaps there is reticence to be seen to be politicising the crisis, despite it being so profoundly political. A cynical reading is that these performances are merely good PR, which of course they are a more pointed criticism might be that for all the talk of it bringing people together, music is actually quite impotent in the face of such a devastating disease, and that awareness hardly needed to be raised about it. The situation is so grave for some that art will seem facile, even indulgent.But Gaga et al’s intentions are ultimately noble, the performers are sincere, and their song choices channel poignancy, acknowledge tenacity and invite self-reflection. They also, meanwhile, show that the chief interior lighting choice for celebrities is the soulful application of candles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2d813d13df7d18f38c14606de0530bc4e2878c5/0_0_4479_2737/master/4479.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33627e9ad1e2fe8fd2b60f76be517ce7 700w","title":"a year on did change uk change anything","story":"The breakaway party of MPs said they would ‘fix politics’. Now, those at the heart of the rebellion reveal why they failedHard as it is to imagine now, in the early part of last year there was a belief – somewhat desperately expressed – that a new politics might be possible in Britain. One not based on the two “legacy” parties, but that might be open to compromise, a certain fluidity of structure, pragmatism. The idea coalesced around a slogan, “politics is broken”. The question was, how to fix it.One solution was proposed by a breakaway group of MPs, eight from Labour, three from the Conservatives, whose new party – the cumbersomely named Independent Group for Change or Change UK – was accepted by the Electoral Commission 12 months ago this week. Both of the main parties were in disarray, propping up leaders for whom there was no love in parliament. The government had recently suffered the biggest defeat in parliamentary history on the “first meaningful vote” on Theresa May’s doomed Brexit deal. If there was consensus on anything, it was that something had to give.Certain collective pictures became memes. There was the photo opportunity in which all 11 stared up to the heavens as if the sky might be the limit. There was a selfie from an evening in which they gathered self-consciously for a cheeky Nando’s, and Twitter pored over the signifiers (“The difference is the last supper only had one Judas”). And there was the morning when they took their places together in the House of Commons, waving to potential comrades trying to avoid their eyes on either side of the aisle. The caption seemed to want to read: come on in, the water’s lovely!In the last few weeks, I have been speaking to some of those who were at the heart of that rebellion, on and off the record, conversations that have emphasised that cliche of the past seeming like another country. My questions really, boiled down to one: did Change UK change anything?Those who were keen to talk – and several were keener not to reopen that recent wound – dated the beginning of the party to way before last spring. Mike Gapes, 27 years a Labour MP, long-time chair of the Foreign Affairs select committee, said the start for him was back in 2015, when Jeremy Corbyn was elected party leader. At the time Gapes was recuperating after two months in hospital with a heart problem. Recovery influenced his desire above all to be true to himself. He agreed with Umunna, who says that by the beginning of 2018, it had long since become “unconscionable to stand on a platform sponsoring someone to become our prime minister who I believed threatened our economic and national security”.Anna Soubry, the Nottinghamshire MP who had become the firebrand voice of the People’s Vote on the Tory side, ascribes her motivation to the lies told in the name of the Vote Leave campaign. “It felt that anyone who refused to go along with a hideous populist agenda was just either ignored or howled down. We still need voices that say: Excuse me, that is not how we do things in this country!”Gavin Shuker, who had represented his home constituency for nine years, dates the genesis to a meeting at the Luton Hoo hotel between himself and Gapes and Chris Leslie, the former shadow chancellor, at the beginning of 2018. “In the 2017 general election,” he says, “many Labour MPs went around telling people on the doorstep that they could vote for us as candidates because there was no real danger of Corbyn getting in. We all knew he was completely unsuitable for office. My feeling was, after the result in 2017, that loophole was closed.”At that meeting at Shuker’s house it was discussed how plan A was still to fight and reclaim the Labour party. It was also agreed that there needed to be “some people thinking what plan B might look like”.Shuker had worked as an organiser in the church prior to entering parliament. He saw his role as “creating the psychological space” in which people might leave the main parties. On this basis he started to have conversations over coffee with 40 or 50 disgruntled Labour MPs. Their responses ranged, he says, from “Thank goodness someone is saying it” to “I agree with everything you’ve said, but I have five years to pay off my mortgage”.Gapes, who had been in the trenches with Neil Kinnock “fighting Trotskyists and tankies who wanted to take over the party” in the days of Militant, now believed the coup had happened. He kept a little diary of his thoughts. “The questions that kept cropping up for me back then were,” he says: “Do you run away? Do you wait for them to come for you? Or do you do something to make a difference?”The answer was made for him after he “vented on a WhatsApp group of friends about antisemitism and some kind person gave that to the Times,” he says. “The fact was, though, that all of us had our own reasons. For me it wasn’t about Brexit. It was antisemitism, Corbyn’s foreign policy, the deplorable comments about the Skripal poisoning.”At the same time that Shuker was sounding out Labour MPs, Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie, who had shared an office at Westminster, were having conversations with likely Tory MPs. Brexit had fractured party loyalties. Umunna was not sure at that time how many Tories would join them. “They were two to three years behind Labour in being hijacked by an ugly populism – in their case, of the right – and it was hard to tell when that would happen, to what degree,” he says. Several prominent Tory MPs told him “that they would hop on board” if it looked like Change UK would succeed. “But this was a bit chicken and egg – unless a critical mass of MPs defected from the main parties and joined, it would not succeed.”Soubry was among those to take the leap, partly on the understanding that Umunna would lead the new party. She saw Umunna as a potential prime minister. “Abso-bloody-lutely,” she says. “I genuinely believed that.” She spoke to a number of Tories about the idea of resigning the whip. Several wavered, but the two that eventually agreed were Wollaston and Allen.While the Brexit votes and debates were at loud-hailer volume within and outside Westminster, the commitment of various dissenters was being tested. A series of three clandestine meetings, two-day overnight gatherings, were organised by Shuker at a farm in East Sussex for the “20 or so” Labour MPs who were then seriously considering defection. The first time they all sat down for dinner, “there were people in tears around the table”, Shuker says, as members discussed abandoning a lifelong commitment to the Labour movement.At the time the thinking was not to form a new party, Gapes says, at least not yet. “We thought of it in terms of trimesters,” Shuker recalls. “The first trimester was the one we were in. The second would be as an independent parliamentary group, which would go on as long as possible while we agreed how to do the technicalities. The third would be as a political party, which meant that we would be judged by those standards. In the event, the second and third of those phases collapsed into each other and we obviously failed.”That language of gestation was pointed. As Gapes observes, they had, in Berger’s pregnancy, a very real deadline to make the change – it had to happen before she departed on maternity leave. “That helped to sharpen it,” Shuker says, “and in February a parting in the clouds emerged.”Secrecy was paramount. “I told my mother, a lifelong Labour member, that I was going to make a big announcement on TV, but I didn’t tell her what it was,” Gapes, 67, says. “I didn’t tell my brother, a lifelong trade union activist. Mainly because I didn’t want anyone to talk me out of it.”Those I spoke to can still just about recall the heady optimism of that moment of departure – hundreds of thousands of people signed up online as supporters, donations started flooding in. For Soubry, if there is one thing that changed everything, it was watching Luciana Berger stand up and be counted.“I think that will stand as the iconic moment,” she says. “Luciana was very striking, heavily pregnant, and the sight of her saying she had left the party that had been her life because as a Jewish person she had been hounded out… I think that was the moment that completely destroyed Corbyn’s chances of ever getting elected.”Even at the time of the Nando’s summit, Soubry was adamant in her faith that she was joining a new party led by Umunna. She still believes that things might have been different if the former Streatham MP had taken on the responsibility as promised. “He had the chance on more than one occasion and he chose not to do it,” she says. She never had an explanation.Umunna rejects the idea that he reneged on any promises to lead, saying that the proper time to settle the question of leadership would have been in the autumn of 2019, once the group had a proper structure. Shuker puts that reluctance to take responsibility down to the planned progression of the trimesters. For the new group to get any traction, it needed as many defectors as possible. “People would say, this sounds attractive, but I don’t want to hitch my future to one person’s vanity project,” Shuker says. “Chuka is someone I respect and am still friends with. At one point I had to give him a list of 20 people who were telling me that they would not join a political party led by him, because they thought there should be a more collaborative process. A flatter structure.”That flatter structure quickly came up against the Electoral Commission. The group reckoned they had maybe a one-in-five chance of becoming a real political force, but if there was an early election “they would probably be screwed”. When the party formed it was far from clear that the UK would take part in the European elections planned for May – constitutionally it appeared absurd.When the EU insisted that in the absence of a Brexit deal Britain must take part, however, the group was forced drastically to accelerate its plans. “We had no organisation. No membership. No name,” Gapes recalls. “We tried to register ourselves as the Independent Group and the Electoral Commission would not allow that. So we then became the Independent Group for Change Not ideal. We had a good logo, but that was rejected because it had a hashtag in it. And we imagined we could share the leadership, but the Electoral Commission insisted on us naming one leader.”Heidi Allen, the least experienced of the MPs involved, who had been selected for the safest of Tory seats in South Cambridgeshire in 2015, was installed as a compromise interim leader. “Heidi had some great qualities,” Gapes says, “but she was completely inexperienced as a campaigner.” Having selected a list of 70 candidates from 3,500 applicants in a frenzied Easter weekend of interviews in a London hotel suite, there was immediate confusion about whether to collaborate with other parties. Acting on dubious promises of a united Remainer front, Gapes says, “Heidi started telling people to vote tactically for the Greens or the Lib Dems. And of course the Lib Dems set out to kill us and they ruthlessly did so, as they have done to others in the past.”Umunna suggests that he knew the writing was on the wall as soon as they had to fight the election, which was a “lose-lose” decision. Until then, he says: “We presented no threat, and even traditionally Tory-supporting media were favourable, because they admired the stand we had taken against Corbynism and the hard Brexiters. However, as soon as we registered as a party, the entire establishment – Labour and Tory – turned their fire on us.”New parties might survive many things, Shuker suggests, but they cannot survive ridicule. “The ambition when we launched was to get to the end of the week without becoming a punchline. And we did that pretty well. But you get one shot at forming a political party and if you end up in the calamity that was the European election campaign, where we literally did become the punchline, there was no coming back from that.”The new ideals of consensual politics did not work in the heat of media scrutiny of a campaign. The street fighters in the group who had prevailed in marginal seats over the years came up against those who had a slightly dewy-eyed faith in a “movement” in which things could be done differently. The split was generational as much as ideological. Soubry suggests that “those with deep experience of winning tough elections – Mike, Joan Ryan, Anne Coffey – were elbowed out a bit”.Far from modelling a new politics, the group started to look like they had brought with them the ingrained habits of rats in a sack. “There were a lot of egos,” Shuker says. “At one point I brought in FTSE 100 executive coaching to try to get the group to realise that the biggest threat we faced was holding on to the culture they had left behind. But then you found that some people could not resist going back to the old ways of anonymous briefing to the press and so on.”After the results came through, there was a showdown, Gapes says, between the six who wanted to close the party down – Ummuna, Allen, Berger, Smith, Shuker and Wollaston – and the other five older hands who thought they should battle on. Parliamentary politics after all was as fluid as it had ever been. “But the six decided no. There was no mention in any of that, of anyone joining the Lib Dems. None whatsoever,” Gapes says. (That is not quite how Umunna remembers it, he says, in that he “didn’t rule out” the possibility.) Within weeks, all of those who left, apart from Shuker, joined the Liberal Democrats.Soubry became the reluctant leader of the remaining five. Over the following months, her most significant role in that capacity was to sit in on meetings that tried to resolve the impasse over Brexit. At one point in October, as prime minister Boris Johnson dissolved parliament and tried to keep open the idea of no deal, it seemed likely that an interim government might form. “But the thought of me going back to my group and saying ‘Right guys, the plan is we’re going to rally behind Jeremy Corbyn’ was never really going to happen,” Soubry says.At the general election in December, not one of the original 11 defectors was elected. Does Soubry regret their efforts?“Not for a moment,” she says. “I think truthfully, I’m now 63, I was 62 at the time. I didn’t have a mortgage to pay. But the people with real courage were the ones like Chris Leslie, who gave up a potentially great career in the Labour party, and who did have mortgages to pay.” She still believes that the forces that produced their party will “come back and bite. We can’t have a situation where the prime minister is surrounded by sycophants and there is no credible opposition. If Starmer does prove he is the man who can reform the Labour party, then there is some hope. But if he is unable to do that – and I fear he will not be able to stand up to the Trots – then we really have problems.”What does she make of those who so obviously swallowed their principles – I mention Nicky Morgan, though she doesn’t – for the promise of reward?“There are a few where you think, how do they look themselves in the mirror?” she says. “I assume they say: ‘I did the right thing for my family.’ But if you are in politics that can never be enough in my view…” She plans to write a book about her experiences. “It’s funny,” she says, with a laugh. “After the event, a very senior Labour politician said to me: ‘Why didn’t you just speak to me first and I would have told you what Chuka is like.’”Mike Gapes also went down fighting at the election. Did Change UK change anything?“I think we had a moment when we could have made a difference,” he says. “Even in the autumn if Corbyn had been big enough to say, I will stand aside for an interim prime minister, whether that was Margaret Beckett or Ken Clarke, that could have been a game changer. But a Johnson-against-Corbyn election was always going to be a no-brainer.” At his constituency after the count, Gapes got up and talked about the Labour party’s proud history. “I said I was sad that it was led by a man who was unfit to be prime minister but that I was glad that the British people agreed with me.”Gavin Shuker was among those – along with Chris Leslie – who had more to lose than most from his rebellion. When we spoke, he was in the middle of self-quarantine as his partner had mild symptoms of the virus he was not finding that lockdown was conducive to job-hunting. Still, he believes standing up for his principles was the most rewarding experience of his political life. He has been spending his afternoons, like all of us, watching the briefings about coronavirus. “People might ask me in 30 years ‘what did you achieve in your time in politics?’,” he says. “I’m no fan of this government obviously. But still, I will be able to say I helped prevent Jeremy Corbyn from leading us through a huge national crisis. And to be honest, I’ll take that.”• This article was amended on 19 April 2020.

On Saturday, only 21,626 tests were carried out.Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said he viewed the target as impossible. “I cannot see that being achieved,” he said. “It was always designed to be a headline grabber rather than anything else.”Others said a relentless focus on the number of tests performed each day had led to basic data reporting standards falling by the wayside. Prof Sheila Bird, formerly of the Medical Research Council’s biostatistics unit at the University of Cambridge, said: “The level of incompetence in reporting these tests is outrageous.”Gove acknowledged on Sunday that the target referred to tests carried out. In the past fortnight the government has placed a growing emphasis on “testing capacity”. It said that although fewer than 22,000 tests were performed on Saturday, labs now had the capacity to carry out 38,000 tests daily, and this had not been fully taken up by hospitals.Scientists said the distinction was misleading as the logistics of having enough doctors and nurses on the ground to perform swab tests and send off samples continued to be a challenge. “Having the capacity is just the first step,” said Bill Hanage, a British epidemiologist based at Harvard.Bird said the failure to give breakdowns of how many tests were being carried out on patients in hospital, critical workers and family members of critical workers made it impossible to extract prevalence rates of infection in these different groups and other crucial information that would allow scientists to more accurately assess the status of the outbreak in the UK.“This macho thing about the number of tests done each day is leading to a reporting standard that makes the data almost uninterpretable,” she said.Ideally, she said, tests would be reported separately for these different groups and would take into account the fact that hospitalised patients typically have a sequence of three tests over several weeks – an initial positive test followed by two negative tests (the second negative for assurance that the recovering patient is no longer infectious and can be transferred home or to a general ward).“Reporting the number of tests performed each day is a political requirement, not a scientific requirement,” she added.Hanage said that even if the 100,000 target were met, this figure was not a relevant measure of the adequacy of the UK’s testing operation. “Aiming for a large number that sounds good is not the way you should be doing this,” he said.That around a third of those tested in the UK this week had positive results suggests that, while useful for guiding medical treatment, current testing is far below the levels that would be needed for population surveillance.The World Health Organization has repeatedly urged governments to pursue testing and tracing, and some countries, including Singapore and South Korea, have successfully used this approach to contain their outbreaks, while Germany has also continued to carry out contact tracing.The UK abandoned population testing and contact tracing in early March, when case numbers began to rise steeply, but the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on Friday that contact tracing would be reintroduced, including through a proposed NHS smartphone app.Experts say the ability to rely on this approach to safely exit the lockdown will depend critically on widespread population testing beyond the level needed for diagnosing patients in hospital."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a879c107cb499bc8bcd6e50a958106f6274b1935/0_119_3568_2141/master/3568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8c3f99e54c241fe3ae06f20226c4143","title":"labour party financial peril keir starmer members leaked report","story":"Litigation by members could cost party huge sums and come as blow to Keir Starmer’s hopes of unityMore than a dozen people are drawing up legal action against Labour, after they were named in an incendiary leaked report that threatens to plunge the party into financial peril.Claims covering the Data Protection Act, invasion of privacy and libel are all being considered and could be submitted to the party as soon as this week.

It was due to be submitted to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission investigation into antisemitism in the party, but that move was blocked by Labour’s lawyers.Mark Lewis, a lawyer who has been contacted by those seeking legal action, told the Observer: “There are lots and lots of claims. There are claims under the Data Protection Act, there are claims for breach of confidence or invasion of privacy and there are claims for libel. It is a very lengthy report that mentions a lot of people. I’ve been contacted by 15 people. Each one of them could well have several claims. What is going on is phenomenal. It’s a bit like the soldiers leaving a barracks that they have to desert and setting it on fire.“For four years, people in Labour have said there is no antisemitism in the party, it’s just a smear. Now they say that of course there was antisemitism, ‘but it just wasn’t us’. They have not noticed the absurdity of their change of position. There are actions against the party, actions against iniduals, actions against commentators. People need to be careful about statements that have been made. If this bankrupts the Labour party or iniduals, so be it. Actions have consequences.”One of those considering legal action, who asked not to be named, said: “Several of us are already in detailed conversations with a number of legal teams. The Labour party had made serious allegations about our behaviour. These allegations were never put to us and not a single one of us did anything other than to work towards the best possible result in the 2017 election. Many of us are now being subjected to horrendous online abuse directly as a consequence.”Formby has told party staff that the inquiry into the report, ordered by Starmer and deputy leader Angela Rayner, will examine how it was commissioned, the culture it reveals and who leaked it. Local party branches have been ordered not to share it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12f38c31eaf1bce655181d2b0adc8768a36d0840/0_157_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcb8f9d6e89eb85f229050c6faab5cec","title":"tell us how is life in lockdown affecting your gambling","story":"Are you gambling less?

There are a dozen flats in her block and she lives with her seven-year-old son, who she says has asthma-like symptoms. She is furious about “the inconsiderate, selfish behaviour” of residents using communal hallways yet still not complying with lockdown rules.“My neighbour never seemed to do any exercise before and now he’s training for the Olympics, out two or three times a day.”Melissa suspects another neighbour has had “different lovers round” in the evening and has been venting to her friends on their CoronaHell WhatsApp group. She says she is proud to be following the rules and feels it’s right to shame those who don’t. “We all have to protect one another,” she says. “We can only stay safe together if we do the right thing inidually.” She does not want to give her full name.Police have been inundated with thousands of daily reports of people allegedly breaching coronavirus rules, prompting the police’s professional standards body to ask the public to curb “deliberate false reporting” and the spread of “misinformation” to target nuisance neighbours or to settle long-running feuds. To date, 3,203 fixed penalty notices have been issued by police, ranging from 380 in Lancashire down to five in Warwickshire. As Britain enters week five of lockdown, “corona-shaming” has ided debate: what compels a person to publicly corona-shame their neighbour? A moral public duty or an opportunity to vent the mounting frustrations of cabin fever?For Paul Goodwin, who set up the Facebook group Covidiots UK two weeks ago, the answer is obvious: “We have to support the NHS. That’s the reason. The quicker we bring this in line and do what we’re supposed to do, the quicker we return to normalcy.”According to Google Trends, the term Covidiots – defined by Urban Dictionary as “someone who ignores the warnings regarding public health or safety” – first appeared online on 15 March.Goodwin lives in a village in Warwickshire with his wife, who used to be a paramedic. He set up the group for “a couple of dozen friends”, many of them who work in healthcare, “to highlight some of the unbelievable behaviour of people”. There are now almost 200 members. “We had seen so many people here who feel the rules don’t apply to them. They were blatantly setting up barbecues in local parks, having house parties, sunbathing and so on a few weeks ago. More people seem to be complying now.”On Twitter, a photo of a sign pasted on a window by a neighbour to shame “Ann” who “keeps on having a friend round” sparked a row over snitching and sanctimony. Later in the week, a videoclip of crowds on Westminster Bridge breaking social distancing guidelines – ironically, while clapping for the NHS – horrified social media users and went viral.In Norfolk, an NHS nurse went on Facebook to post a photo of a note left on her car. In a spectacular misfire, the note from a neighbour read: “I have been watching you travel everyday … this is clearly unessential travel! You are part of the problem! … You have been reported!”Over Easter weekend, author and Times columnist Caitlin Moran was publicly shamed and branded a hypocrite on Twitter for allegedly spending Friday afternoon in a friend’s garden while writing a piece for the Saturday paper headlined “Lockdown is easy!”. Neither the Times nor Moran commented on the matter. The incident was preceded by cabinet minister Robert Jenrick, who made media appearances urging the public to stay home, while flouting rules to visit his own parents.Jon Ronson, author and consultant on an upcoming HBO documentary about shame, with Monica Lewinsky, said he was unsurprised about how quickly “a Stasi-like” narrative had emerged.“I can maybe, maybe understand the impulse to shop your neighbour – I’ve been quarantining for weeks longer than most and can get annoyed at people flouting the rules when I’m working so hard to stick to them. But it’s difficult, because you will always find transgressions slap bang in the middle of a grey area,” he said. “So what are the rules? I quite like the approach of shaming the behaviour, not the inidual.”Ronson’s 2015 book, So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed, explored the twisted downsides to lecture, cancel, and bully people online. “We’ve seen time and time again when shaming becomes too rampant, terrible things happen. Not least to huge amounts of innocent people.”Over on the website Mumsnet, one user was considering vilifying her husband in the village Facebook group for “going out at least once a day in his twatty sportscar” while another thread on the internet forum was dedicated to analysing “why people are covidiots”.Frustration is evidently running high. “The entitled think they are somehow special and justify their actions to themselves,” wrote lubeybooby. Another poster, Oldhaggard, blamed “good ol’ fashioned selfishness … We’re used to our wants being addressed as needs most of the time, and I think people are struggling to see a difference between them.”“We should set positive norms about behaviour. Rather than starting from a presumption of an ill-will, one should start from the presumption that people are good: trust your neighbour and ask how you can help them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa724d0d8964e207838756c892b2974b6d1d7e29/0_67_5370_3225/master/5370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f72c5140bdcd0451fa75e54204808a9","title":"mansionbet allowed vip gambler to bet redundancy payout","story":"Investigation shows online firm accepted payout as proof gambler could afford bets then gave him ‘VIP’ perksMansionBet accepted a gambler’s redundancy payout as proof that he could afford to place thousands of pounds in bets, and then rewarded him with “VIP” perks for doing so.Evidence reviewed by the  shows that the online betting firm showered “Matt”, 44, with free bets and football tickets even as his gambling spiralled out of control.During 26 calls with a specially allocated VIP manager, Matt begged for free bets and cancelled withdrawals from his account – behaviour considered by the Gambling Commission to be signs of problem gambling.At one stage, Matt sent MansionBet a copy of a redundancy settlement with his previous employer and asked for free bets in return for a promise to deposit large sums funded by the payout. The Gambling Commission’s guidelines state that firms should be wary of accepting funds from anyone who has recently received a “windfall”.A spokesperson from the Gambling Commission said: “While we can’t comment on inidual cases, we are absolutely committed to reducing gambling harms and we expect operators to step in and prevent harm when a customer’s behaviour indicates they are at risk. Given repeated failings with ‘VIP’ practices in the industry, we will also shortly be consulting on additional requirements in this area.”When Matt deposited £8,000, the VIP manager phoned to ask for reassurance that he could afford the bets, noting they were “a large chunk of your annual salary”.But he appeared to accept Matt’s verbal assurance that he had other work, and he dished out more free bets in return.“The thing is, we don’t even want to do it but we have to do it because the UK gambling regulators make us do it.“As a thank you for clearing that up, there’s a £100 free bet for you. I hate being intrusive but I’ll always reward you if you give me proper answers.”A few days later, the VIP manager asked Matt to write a review of MansionBet on Trustpilot, a website that consumers visit to see reviews of brands.Matt was rewarded with another free bet after saying he had left a “rave review”.Transcripts of WhatsApp conversations show that the VIP manager also offered Matt incentives to deposit more money, saying: “If you deposit a further £3,000, I would give you £500 in free bets.”After handing out one bonus, he said: “I hope that’s lucky for you,” but he later admitted: “I tend to give bigger bonuses when you lose.”Matt, whose name has been changed at his request, said: “MansionBet knew I had been made redundant and could see my funds deteriorating every day and yet still allowed me to deposit sickening amounts of money.”The Labour MP Carolyn Harris said: “This is not only exploitative but cruel, predatory and cynical. These cases grow in severity, yet the industry still protest that they behave responsibly. The time for radical change is now.”MansionBet, which has won recognition among British gamblers thanks to sponsorship deals with football teams including Tottenham Hotspur and AFC Bournemouth, said it had refused a request from Matt to refund money deposited in his sports betting account.“This case has been reviewed thoroughly by senior management due to the extensive nature of the contacts by the customer, and we are satisfied all conclusions drawn are in line with our regulatory requirements,” said a spokesperson.“MansionBet disagrees with the characterisations of the incidents in question, as put forward by you in your questions.”The Gambling Commission is considering whether to ban VIP schemes, which have been linked to a string of cases in which firms failed to protect vulnerable addicts.The regulator, which has come under fire over its effectiveness, has commissioned a review of VIP schemes led by GVC, which itself has been criticised over VIP schemes run by its Ladbrokes business.In an interim report, the review suggested new restrictions such as barring under-25s from VIP schemes and enhanced checks before customers can join the schemes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8cd5e2faba4ae50298bf93acf1e9bea1089b55d/0_60_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6576a14eb39ea1b0f31f5ce533626764","title":"tech revolution only one in four seek face to face gp visits","story":"Royal College of GPs chair praises public for adapting to coronavirus lockdownOnly one in four patients is now seeing a GP face to face, with the vast majority getting care through telephone and video consultations, research shows.The “revolution” in how patients access family doctors – a direct result of the coronavirus – is revealed in figures collected by the Royal College of GPs.The figures covering around 500 GP practices in England have been collected and shared with the  by the college’s research surveillance centre.“We’ve seen a very rapid and necessary revolution in the way care is delivered in general practice and the way GPs, our teams and our patients have adapted to this has been remarkable”, said Prof Martin Marshall, the college’s chair.Marshall hopes significant numbers of patients will continue to receive remote care once the coronavirus crisis is over, though he stressed that anyone wanting an in-person appointment or needing to receive one for a vaccination, for example, would continue to have one.He also stressed that GP surgeries’ recent dramatic expansion of telephone and video consultations may also encourage patients who are ill with non-Covid ailments to seek help that way rather than shun NHS services altogether.Doctors are increasingly concerned by patients risking their health and even their lives by not seeing a GP, going to A\u0026ampE or dialling 999 when they develop symptoms such as pain or shortness of breath because they do not want to risk contracting coronavirus or add to NHS staff’s burden.Marshall said too few GPs had secure access to patient records from home, which meant some who self-isolated because of the virus were unable to keep on working.“We are still facing barriers. Many GPs, for example, are telling us they are having technological difficulties with working remotely from home due to a lack of adequate hardware and software. This means that they can’t undertake patient consultations if they are having to self-isolate but still well enough to work, and affects capacity across the rest of the service,” he said.“It’s also imperative that we safeguard the technological advances we have made during the pandemic, so that we can continue to work in different ways in the best interests of patients when we eventually get Covid-19 under control. Having the technological capability to offer remote consultations, where appropriate, will be beneficial for general practice, the wider NHS and most importantly our patients.”He wants ministers and NHS leaders to cover the cost of GP surgeries buying thousands of laptops for doctors and practice nurses so that they can talk to patients on the phone while using a VPN link to look at their medical records."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/043f1f7dcb7c0cdbcaff7dd04684d5a41525231b/0_4_3392_2035/master/3392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6e6821e668bacdc7d1cfb267a30afe9","title":"tennis owes debt players cost lockdown coronavirus","story":"Lower-ranked professionals were living off scraps even before the pandemic but now their plight may finally be recognisedAt the exact moment the International Tennis Federation announced the immediate cancellation of all events in March, Panna Udvardy was deep in battle, breaking serve at a lowly ITF World Tennis Tour event in Olímpia, Brazil. While the sport’s commentariat descended into a collective state of shock, Udvardy was pumping her fist and peering towards her coach. She quickly realised he was not staring back.“I looked at my coach and he was talking to the supervisor. I was like: ‘Come on, why are you talking to him? Watch the match!’ And then I won, I played like three hours, I came off court. My coach told me that at 3-1 the supervisor had talked to him and cancelled the tournament.”What happened next was a reflection of tennis’s great weakness. Udvardy, a 21-year-old Hungarian ranked 347 by the WTA, had spent thousands of dollars to fly herself and her coach to Olímpia with the goal of minimising costs by entering a series of tournaments in Brazil. While hundreds of players at Indian Wells, the fifth biggest tournament in the world, were offered first-round prize money to cover costs after its cancellation, she was forced to immediately purchase two tickets out of Brazil that she could not afford.The faulty financial model of tennis has long been problematic as prize money has disproportionately risen at the top over the past decades, but the coronavirus pandemic is a transformative moment that requires a sweeping response. Tennis players are private contractors who earn money only when they compete, or if they are lucky enough to encounter sponsorships. Now they earn nothing.For Udvardy, the $4,000 (£3,150) she made before taxes in the first three months of this year was supplemented with sporadic coaching and small sponsorships from helpful companies. Those companies are now at risk and social distancing regulations forbid her from coaching.“I’m not sure what I’m going to do if it’s going to be much longer,” she says. “There’s no way I can do anything else. I can’t even go away and give lessons. It’s just really hard. I think everyone is in the same situation as I am and we all need help from the ITF and WTA.”In the same breath, she is quick to point out that her situation is better than most. She has received some assistance from the Hungarian federation and she is young – her desperation to fulfil her potential means that, no matter where she is financially whenever normality resumes, she will return to the foot of the mountain to climb again if she must. Instead, she is more concerned about those who may be pushed out of the sport for good.Although Greece possesses more top-20 players than Great Britain and France combined, Grammatikopoulou, ranked 297, has not received a penny of support. Greece’s national federation is insignificant and she does not qualify for government financial help. For the first time in a decade she has returned to her small hometown of Axioupoli for more than just a couple of weeks. Her father sells curtains and pillows in the local market and the family is living off his government furlough.By all indications, tennis’s stakeholders are finally appropriately recognising their forgotten classes. After hours of discussions with his fellow members Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, the ATP player council president, Novak Djokovic, last week sent an email to players detailing his proposed relief fund for those ranked between 250 and 700.The fund would include a sliding scale of contributions from top-100 players based on ranking groups, ranging from $30,000 contributed by top-five players to $5,000 by those ranked between 50 and 100. Along with $500,000 contributions from grand slam tournaments and money sourced from future events, the hope is for a pot of between $4m and $4.5m, with $10k for each player. The WTA is said to be in similar discussions on behalf of its players.The proposal requires the votes of Djokovic’s fellow players, some of whom may have qualms about contributing a far greater percentage of their earnings than the top players. Regardless, it represents an unprecedented period in the history of the sport, which was underlined by Djokovic’s comments during his recent Instagram live chat with Stan Wawrinka. If the world No 1 has his way, this is a tipping point, an opportunity to change the lower levels of men’s and women’s tennis for ever.“These guys that are ranked 250 onwards, they are the ones that make the grassroots of tennis, that make the future of tennis and I feel we have to be united,” Djokovic said. “We have to support them. We have to show them that they are not forgotten, that we are there for them. But also I feel we have to send a message to the younger generations that are taking in consideration to be professional players, to show them that they can live out of tennis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26336043ec20579acafe197359061e56a8f07a93/0_1_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af56ac644f4bc7c65720f921ee12cc1b","title":"we laugh at dark things glasgow alt comedy scene","story":"Wit and four-letter artistry have made Glasgow a comedy stronghold – and with the clubs shut, the laughs are going onlineGlaswegian comedians haven’t always been complimentary about their home city. “The great thing about Glasgow is that if there’s a nuclear attack it’ll look exactly the same afterwards,” said Billy Connolly. According to Frankie Boyle: “Swearing is different in Scotland. In Glasgow the word ‘fucking’ is just a warning that a noun is on its way.”Like Connolly and Boyle, many world-class comedians started out here and found the city rich in material, from Susan Calman, Kevin Bridges and Limmy to, more recently, Amna Saleem and Larry Dean. Janey Godley, who carried the infamous “Trump is a cunt” sign in a 2016 protest at Turnberry golf course, has been performing standup in Glasgow for more than 25 years. Glaswegians are, she says, “observational storytellers”. Godley has often used humour to tackle tough subjects – the murder of her mother, sexual abuse, her ties with gangsters – and her new show covers online run-ins with the far right. “We tend to be gritty, tell-it-like-it-is comics,” she says. “We laugh at dark things.”Growing up in Glasgow in the 60s and 70s, standup Lubna Kerr witnessed this inclination for people to face issues such as sectarianism with humour. “It’s important to be able to laugh about things like that … it lessens it,” she says. Kerr talks about sectarianism on stage and also tackles racism. A question she’s been asked too many times – “Where are you really from?” – became the title for her last show. Born in Pakistan, Kerr came to standup in her 50s and initially performed character comedy, exploring stereotypes of Asian women. Now she performs as herself and, like Godley, embraces storytelling: “Every Glaswegian tells stories in such a wonderful, descriptive manner.”There’s always been an array of comedy nights to nurture Glaswegian talent, including a couple run by Godley, although her favourite spots to play nowadays are the Stand (which opened in 2000) and a new arrival, the Glee Club. “It’s a very open city for comedy,” she says. “Every time you put a gig on people were like, ‘Comedy, yes!’”The audience has been treated to Chris Thorburn’s imagined theme tune for There Will Be Blood and Richard Brown as a robot programmed to spout standup cliches. Jones has appeared as “North Korea’s favourite observational comedian”, with quips such as: “Hey guys, have you ever noticed how everything’s fine?” In that routine: “We played the whole North Korean national anthem and made everybody stand.”Chunks’ experiments are often the starting point for something bigger. Amelia Bayler regularly tries out comedy songs there that she later weaves into shows. Since 2016, the collective has run Chunkstival, a curated lineup of these alternative shows during the Glasgow international comedy festival, culminating in a “spoof awards show”. There’s a touch of Glaswegian darkness woven through the silliness of Chunks. None of their comedy is “floaty”, says Jones Brown’s latest standup, Horror Show, riffs on the similarities between jump-scares and laughs.That grittiness disguises warmth. “The alternative scene in Glasgow is open to everyone,” says Brown. “We’ve got a lot of young working-class people – it’s not at all exclusive.”Other local nights such as Light Bulb, Vision Board, Diversity Quota and the Salon also cater to alternative comedy fans. “The Glasgow scene is so tight-knit,” says Brown, “but it’s not in competition with itself. We’re all in this together.”Emily Benita and Rachel Anne Clarke have run the Salon since 2018, after experiencing aggressive atmospheres on the circuit. “My priority was a comedy night I was comfortable bringing people to,” says Clarke. “We wanted something that felt fun.” They present musical comedy, improv and cabaret. The duo also perform sketches as Ambush, with writing partner Dorothy Jane Stewart. “That’s what people really responded to – we realised there was not a lot of live sketch comedy,” says Benita. “If there’s no party you want to go to, you have to throw one yourself.”Kerr had a similar thought when she formed Funny Lassies with Shona Lawson and Natalie Sweeney in 2017, and the Women of Colour Comedy Collective last year. She encouraged Pakistani women to come and watch comedy, some of them for the first time. Scottish comics Zara Janjua and Kavita Bhardwaj and American Arri Smith performed, while the audience enjoyed afternoon tea. Kerr delivered some jokes in Urdu.Both gigs were part of the Glasgow international comedy festival. Although its neighbour Edinburgh might have a rather larger festival, since March 2003, Glasgow has kicked off comedy season with three weeks of new shows and tour highlights. Coronavirus cut this year’s festivities short, but many have taken their comedy online. Godley has upped her output of social media videos, dubbing over footage of politicians in a Scots dialect. Highlights include a reimagining of Nigel Farage’s appearance, in shorts, to talk about coronavirus on Facebook Live (“Dry your fannies, girls,” says Godley, “cos here’s the crotch shot!”).The pandemic has highlighted the strength of Glasgow’s comedy communities. “A lot of people are struggling and everyone’s coming together,” says Brown. “Even though most of the time we’re just being idiots, we’ve created this group of people who care for each other.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e155dd8b559278a6b7aa222715e86e98d7b272ad/0_316_4743_2846/master/4743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e4d353976cdafe94c56c98676b3b3b1","title":"hottest front room seats the best theatre and dance to watch online","story":"From live-streams of new plays to classics from the archive, here are some of the top shows online now or coming soon – this page is updated dailyHampstead theatre and the  have teamed up to stream a series of acclaimed productions for free.

Bausch’s company memorably balanced apples on their heads in Palermo Palermo, but as Smashed is created by those juggling supremos Gandini, the fruit is mostly in motion here.

In his annual letter to shareholders on Thursday, Bezos said Amazon had assembled a team of scientists and software engineers to build internal testing capacity, and hoped to build its own testing laboratory soon.“Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available,” he said.Amazon is also rapidly hiring staff to keep up with demand from shoppers. The company said on Monday it was hiring an extra 75,000 staff to help it to process the increase in orders. Those new recruits come on top of 100,000 taken on already since the coronavirus crisis hit western economies last month. The additional workers will take Amazon’s global workforce to nearly 1 million.Joshua Warner, an analyst at the London-based online trading firm IG Index, said: “Amazon shines from all angles during the coronavirus crisis. Ultimately, Amazon will remain one of the most important businesses during this crisis, providing key services including food, entertainment and shopping at a time when consumers have fewer retailers to choose from.“Amazon stock has rocketed to a new record high,” he added. “Of all the firms that might stand to benefit, Amazon is a clear winner.” • This article was amended to correct the date for Amazon’s reporting of its quarterly earnings. The earnings report is scheduled for 30 April.

She looks sad-eyed and baffled into the camera: “We don’t really know.” Perhaps, she muses, the problem is something to do with the “erse mix of people onboard our ships” and is “being magnified by our core values to respect, protect and connect the world”. She implores her “guests” with a “simple request”: “We ask you to book a future Princess cruise to your dream destination … as a symbol to the world that the things that connect us are stronger than those that ide us.”Her company does seem to have been terribly unlucky. Their Diamond Princess, quarantined off Yokohama, which suffered over 700 infections and eight deaths among its passengers and crew, was a conspicuous early victim of the pandemic, its global fame growing on wry-turning-to-desperate postings from its passengers. The Ruby Princess, from which 2,700 passengers disembarked in Sydney on March 19, became the single largest source of Covid-19 cases in Australia. The Grand Princess was stuck outside San Francisco, its passengers confined to their cabins, after an outbreak in early March. Something similar happened to the Coral Princess in early April, off the coast of Florida. And this to say nothing of the Caribbean Princess, which has twice this year had to end cruises early, due to hundreds falling ill from a quite different infection, the vomiting bug norovirus.But not everyone is yet convinced that all of Princess’s misadventures are purely bad luck. New South Wales police have launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess, to see whether its owners were “transparent in contextualising the true patient and crew health conditions relevant to Covid-19”. They are suspected of lying, in other words, about conditions on the ship. Legal actions have sprung up from unhappy “guests” of the Grand Princess, their trips-of-a-lifetime wrecked by allegedly inadequate screening procedures. Professor Kentaro Iwata, a Japanese expert on infectious diseases who went on to the Diamond Princess, described the onboard response to the virus as “completely chaotic”.A rather obvious question is whether Covid-19 is simply an act of God, or whether its impact on their passengers, crew and host ports has been magnified by the practices of cruise companies. They vigorously push back against this suggestion: a spokesman for Carnival tells me that “the cruise industry took action before most other industries on land took actions”, that “cruise ships are social gathering places, but no less risky than any other social gathering venue”, and asks “when was the last time you were asked to fill out a health record before being allowed to enter a concert?” In the case of the Diamond Princess, say Princess Cruises, they were following instructions from the Japanese health authorities.Trust on this question, on the other hand, is not improved by reports that some cruise-line salespeople (not Carnival), in mid-March, were being instructed to talk punters out of their concerns about Covid-19, for example claiming that the coronavirus could not survive in tropical climates and that therefore it was a good time to visit the Caribbean. Trust is further weakened by the cruise industry’s long history of environmental and safety lapses, and their special skill at minimising the consequences to themselves.A bigger question is whether the virus will dent, deflect or alter what has been a phenomenon of our times, the many-times multiplication of ship sizes, of passenger numbers and of profits, generated by an industry that manufactures its own version of reality, then shapes the places that its ships visit in the image of that reality. Cruises, as Wallace put it, serve that “part of me that craves pampering and passive pleasure: the dissatisfied-infant part of me, the part that always and indiscriminately wants”. Cruises are founded on fantasy, which means the removal from view of anything irksome or demanding of difficult choices.All of which might be good, clean fun, if the growth of cruises weren’t accompanied by reports of pollution spills, outbreaks of disease, accidents, mistreatment of workers and sexual assaults and other crimes. If these reports don’t change much over the decades it is because the cruise lines don’t change much, either. They can spend lavishly on lobbying and campaign contributions to friendly politicians, and hire lawyers to see off the lawsuits when things go wrong. Their business being offshore, cruise lines are free to choose the countries where they register their ships and incorporate their business, which means places like Panama, the Bahamas or Bermuda, where they can pay low taxes and get an easy ride on labour rights, and on health, safety and environmental regulations.“They only change when they have to,” says Ross Klein, a sociology professor at Memorial University in Newfoundland, whose website cruisejunkie chronicles the mishaps of the cruise business. And nobody much makes them change. There is a trade body, the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), which promotes the business and in theory upholds standards. “They will tell you that they have mandatory regulations and that they meet or exceed international regulations,” says Klein. “Well, we asked CLIA’s senior vice-president what happens when a company violates these regulations: nothing. Perhaps a stern talking-to, but otherwise nothing.”Cruise companies’ aversion to responsibility can be seen in a legendary court filing following the “poop cruise” of 2013, in which failing generators on the Carnival Triumph caused a backup of raw sewage into the passenger areas. Carnivals’ lawyers, CNN reported, said that the “ticket contract makes absolutely no guarantee for safe passage, a seaworthy vessel, adequate and wholesome food, and sanitary and safe living conditions.” Equally striking was the legal outcome to the 2012 wreck of the Costa Concordia, when the party atmosphere of cruises mixed fatally with questions of navigation: the owner Costa Crociere (another part of the Carnival empire), with the help of a plea bargain and €1m fine, and despite clear failings on its part, was freed of any management and operational responsibility.Or you could take another incident that befell the ever unfortunate Princess Cruise lines, when the Caribbean Princess was found to have been dumping oily waste in the sea off southern England. In 2017 a Florida court found that the Caribbean and four more Princesses had been engaging in illegal practices, issued a record fine of $40m and put the company on probation for five years. President Jan Swartz performed a hand-wring to camera, as she has over Covid-19, to say that “we are very sorry for the actions of our employees” and that “the marine environment is incredibly important to us”.Princess ships then continued to pollute, for example by depositing faecal coliform in Alaskan waters. In 2019 they were fined a further $20m. If a combined penalty of $60m sounds like a lot, it is as Klein points out a small portion of the $3bn or so annual profits of Princess’s owner, Carnival. “To them, that’s just a cost of doing business,” he says.And you have Venice, the actual city rather than the theme versions, where for years what are effectively multistorey hotels have been looming over its historic architecture, their mighty parps competing with church bells, their diesel smoke polluting the air, damaging the ecology of the lagoon and, say protesters, the foundations of buildings with the water they displace, and discharging thousands-strong fluxes of tourists on highly managed six-hour trinket-and-selfie binges in the city. Then, last summer, the 65,000-ton MSC Opera, its engine failing, crunched into a moored tourist boat like a boot on to a bug. There were miraculously no deaths, but the crash made the cruise industry’s previous assurances of safety sound hollow.Despite excited reports last year that large ships would be banned from the city, nothing definite has been decided. At most, larger ships will be displaced to other ports in the Venetian lagoon, which would involve new environmental impacts. Among the complications in finding a solution is the fact that Carnival, Royal Caribbean and other big cruise companies are shareholders of the company that owns Venice’s maritime port.The issue is not just about the filth and damage that ships emit into Venetian air and water, but of the superficial interaction that cruise ships generate between passengers and their host city. Eleonora Sovrani, of the local campaign group We Are Here Venice, argues that the cruises’ “guests” – on their brief visits, following itineraries proposed by the ships, visiting outlets suggested by them – never leave the cruise “bubble”. The city is forced “to change its aspect to answer expectations of the cruise companies,” she says, in what is a form of “cultural appropriation”.What goes for Venice now goes for many other places in the world. In pre-virus Sydney, successive ships would be moored near the considerably smaller Opera House, almost permanently blocking certain views, while others would be waiting their turn out in the bay. Cruises have shown increasing enthusiasm for invading the Arctic and Antarctic, their paths eased by the melting of globally warmed ice, with many thousands of gawpers descending on tiny Inuit settlements. In New Zealand, Princess Cruises – hello, my old friend – were obliged to apologise for their crassness, after some non-Maori men with DIY skirts and scribbles on their face were hired to perform an am-dram version of a traditional Maori welcome to passengers on the Golden Princess.To all these points the cruise industry naturally has its responses. They make claims about health, safety and the environment, which for the reasons given by Ross Klein should be treated sceptically. They say, for example, that norovirus is rare on cruise ships, using data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC, however, is only able to obtain information on ships that visit US ports, so can’t give global statistics, which limits the usefulness of any conclusions that might be drawn.Cruise companies argue that they create employment, which they do, for everyone from officers to crew to waiters to beauticians and standup comedians. They say that they bring revenue to their host cities, which they also do, though Klein and others dispute the level of benefits claimed by the companiesSince cruise passengers sleep on their ships and also tend to eat and drink on them, their benefit to local hotels, restaurants and bars is limited. Those shore-based traders to whom the ships direct their passengers generally have to pay a handsome cut for the privilege. Cruise lines also acquire interests in terminals and retail outlets, such that even more income is whisked away from their host ports. Just supposing that the tourist dollar were not so relentlessly hoovered up by cruises, might it not be generating other, maybe more rewarding jobs in businesses that don’t have the same breaks on taxes and regulations?The cruise companies’ strongest argument is that their customers love their product. Which, mostly, they do. Even some who endured the Covid-cursed cruises say they will go back to the ships when they can. And to sail the seas and see the world is, indeed, a great thing. But perhaps cruise passengers would have an even better time if there weren’t a nagging feeling that the management might not be totally on top of novel or familiar viruses on their ship, or that the excretions and eructations of their big white ships are trashing the beauties they are paying to see.And claims of passenger satisfaction and revenue-generation should not invalidate the wishes of host cities for basic respect or the argument that the quality of interaction between tourists and locals is as important as the quantity. As Sovrani puts it, cruises should adapt to cities, not the other way round. Again, cruise passengers might have a better time if they were not thrust into the cogs of an engine of exploitation.Much, of course, depends on what happens in the world to come after the virus, which not so long ago was barely a blip on the radar. Forbes magazine, on January 20, could see only “smooth sailing into the 2020s”. In February CNN quoted various experts saying it was still OK to cruise. The Cruise Dialogue conference met in Cartagena, Colombia, also in February, asking its industry delegates and speakers “how best to accommodate the seemingly unstoppable growth of cruise activities?” Almost no one mentioned the virus.The Zaandam set off on its disastrous voyage on 7 March (when, as Klein points out, a number of ships had already been turned away from ports). On the previous day there was the first talk of federal help for the cruise industry, an idea that seemed open to doubt, given the cruise companies’ exotic registrations: if they don’t pay US taxes, how could they receive US subsidies? Even President Trump, who notwithstanding those pesky Panamanian and Bahamian flags called cruises “a great US business”, acknowledged the problem, before saying that “we’re going to try and work something out”. Which, not least because Carnival’s chairman Micky Arison is a friend and backer of Trump, the company having been a sponsor of The Apprentice, you can be sure he will try very hard to do.“The infantile part of me,” wrote David Foster Wallace, “is by its very nature insatiable.” However much gratification and pampering it will receive, it “will simply adjust its desires upward until it once again levels out at its homeostasis of terrible dissatisfaction.” He could as well have been describing the cruise business as its customer experience. Now, though, it is time for cruises to grow up: if the industry has been based on the outsourcing of reality, reality has come back to bite it. A CLIA spokeswoman tells me that they “aim to do our part to protect the sanctity of the destinations we visit so that they can remain a vibrant place to live and visit for generations to come”. Let’s hope so: if it wants public money and public trust, the cruise business should accept the public responsibilities it has been so good at shirking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa363a080b840577c8399130ee588d56ae0e45d3/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae6ef6d6826499d4e1761d005265d016","title":"deepwater horizon mexico 10 years on","story":"BP denied the oil reached Mexico, but fisherman and scientists knew it wasn’t true. Ten years on, Mexican communities haven’t received a cent in compensationby  Nina Lakhani in Saladero, VeracruzErica Ríos Martínez grew-up in a riverside community filled with food and fiestas thanks to a booming fishing industry which supported tens of thousands of families across the Gulf of Mexico.After high school, Ríos Martínez moved to a nearby town for college which she financed by selling blue crabs, shrimp and tilapia fished by her father in the Tamiahua lagoon – an elongated coastal inlet famed for its abundant shellfish.But fish stocks began to decline in 2011 across the Gulf – the year after BP’s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded 200 miles north of Mexican territory. The offshore rig sank and released almost 5m barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico over 87 days. Oil plumes coated hundreds of miles of shoreline, causing catastrophic damage to marine life, coral reefs and birds.Amid public and political outrage in the US, BP took full responsibility for the worst oil spill of the 20th century, which killed 11 crew members and injured 17 others. The company has paid out $69bn, including more than $10bn to affected fishermen and businesses.But BP denied the oil reached Mexico, claiming the ocean current propelled the huge spill in the opposite direction. However, fishermen and Mexican scientists knew this wasn’t true.“Before the spill we had freezers full of fish. Afterwards, my father couldn’t catch enough to support me, no matter how many hours he spent fishing. It was the same for the whole community, and it has just got worse and worse,” said Ríos Martínez, 31, who was forced to drop out of university and move away.Ten years later, Mexican communities have not received a single cent in compensation.“To claim the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem has borders is absurd, discriminatory and defies scientific knowledge,” said Eduardo Rubio, an expert in soil and water pollution at the College of Biologists.Saladero is a picturesque sleepy village situated on the bank of the Tancochin River which snakes into the south-westerly edge of the lagoon.The lagoon was famous for prawns and oysters fishermen recall giving away because stocks were so abundant.Now, youngsters are forced to migrate to find factory work in maquilas in faraway cities.“The village is full of us old people, there’s nothing for the young here any more,” said Juan Mar Aran, 78, a fisherman for 60 years. “Before, we worked hard and had money in our pockets, now we depend on our children, even the dogs are skinny. It’s very unjust, we’ve been completely abandoned.”In 2010, the Saladero fishing cooperative registered 11,663kg of shrimp, 36kg of bass and 281,125kg of oysters. The decline has not been linear and publicly available official data is inconclusive, but in 2019, the co-op registered only 1,000kg of shrimp, 20kg of bass, and no oysters.In Tamiahua, a small town across the lagoon, Eduviges Mendoza lit a cigarette on his small fishing boat, parked beside a row of wooden poles waiting for shrimp to fill his small net.It’s dusk, and chilly as Mendoza, 53, settled in for a second consecutive night on the lagoon with only a ratty blanket and a waterproof onesie for warmth. “There’s less fish, nobody can deny that. I’m lucky if I make enough to cover the petrol.”Despite such sentiments BP has claimed that aerial images prove the oil spill’s impact was contained in US waters.Yet back in 2011, Sergio Jiménez, a leading government oceanographer in Tamaulipas state, discovered the BP oil fingerprint more than 200 metres below sea level. Hydrocarbon fingerprints, like human ones, are unique.The oil from Deepwater Horizon was propelled south by the deep underwater current – distinct from the surface current, according to Jiménez, who in 2013 testified in a Louisiana court tasked with managing hundreds of claims against BP.But the case was dismissed after the court ruled that Mexico’s lawsuit, filed by the then president, Enrique Peña Nieto, just days before the deadline, superseded inidual state claims. The case trundled along until in 2018, the Mexican government withdrew the lawsuit and settled the case for $25.5m – absolving BP from responsibility for polluting Mexican waters. The secret deal, exposed in a joint investigation by BuzzFeed and the transparency group Poder, means the company no longer faces claims by any Mexican government entity.Around the same time, the outgoing President Peña Nieto made several multimillion-dollar deals with BP. Hundreds of the company’s petrol stations have opened across the country.Jiménez stands by his findings and a recent study by the University of Miami backed his research, concluding that the spread of oil was far greater and more catastrophic than previously thought, as satellites and aerial images failed to detect oil at lower concentrations below the surface.In part, this is probably due to the unprecedented quantities of toxic chemicals (dispersants) BP applied in order to stop visible oil plumes making landfall.“It could take at least 20 to 25 years for the ecosystem to recover because of the deepwater contamination,” said the investigative oceanographer Luis Soto.But scientific study, like compensation, has been massively skewed.In Mexico no long-term studies monitoring the impact of the spill and the dispersants have been conducted.By contrast in the US, a research working group created by BP conducted more than 240 studies, which cost $1.3bn in less than five years after the spill. BP also set up a $500m, 10-year program to monitor US waters just over a month after the spill and aid to restore the ecosystem.BP has not directly funded any studies or working groups in Mexico, but the battle for justice goes on.In Mexico, a class-action lawsuit was launched against four BP subsidiaries – two headquartered in Texas, two in Mexico – in December 2015, by an NGO working with pro bono lawyers specialising in environmental disasters.It took two years and several court orders to track down the correct addresses of the Mexican subsidiaries in order to kickstart proceedings. Finally, in September 2019, the lawsuit was authorised to proceed despite BP’s efforts to have it dismissed, but is currently on hold since BP appealed.“BP’s pattern has been to deny everything, and claim the class action no merit, meanwhile settling many cases worth billions of dollars in the US. The position of BP is sad, but so is the position of the Mexican government which has ignored the plight of its own people,” said lawyer Karla Borja.In 2019, Mexico’s new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (Amlo), promised the fishermen a fair deal. “Amlo promised to make the company pay. But so far we’ve seen nothing but nice words and meetings,” said Aran, the co-op president.In Louisiana, more than 110 cases involving thousands of Mexicans remain open, but have yet to be heard. Scores more have been dismissed.In March, the fishermen leading 41 of those cases wrote to the new CEO of BP, Bernard Looney, requesting he do the right thing and compensate the Mexicans affected by the oil spill.In a statement BP said: “All available evidence confirms that oil from the Deepwater Horizon incident did not reach Mexican waters or shorelines … We value the opportunity to do business in Mexico, and we are committed to the highest standards of conduct and full compliance with the laws.”In Saladero, shortly before the 10th anniversary of the disaster, about 150 people turned out for the town hall-style meeting, to share stories of hardship resulting from the demise of the lagoon which has ided families and crushed educational and career ambitions.The primary school has fewer than 30 enrolled pupils, compared with more than a hundred before the spill. The only gas station shut down and abandoned boats dot the riverbank.Numerous parents said they were forced to pull their children out of college so they could start work and send home remittances to support the family.“There’s no money because there’s no fish, that’s why all our young people leave,” said Juana Constantino, 59, who cares for her grandson while her daughter works in a maquila in Reynosa, one of Mexico’s most dangerous border towns. “We need compensation, we want justice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/932a59f304fcdd8f09fff98cdc1ea35832d65ca8/0_106_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa482ae489cd83fc78921bf26ca81d0b","title":"how has access to outside space impacted you during the lockdown","story":"We would like to know how your experience of lockdown in the UK has been shaped by your access to outdoor spaceWith lockdowns in place around the world, we know that the experience of staying indoors is very different depending on your access to outdoor space.We’d like to hear how your access to space has impacted you over the last three weeks.

On testing, contact tracing and equipment supply, there was a failure to prepare By late December last year, doctors in the central Chinese city of Wuhan were starting to worry about patients quarantined in their hospitals suffering from an unusual type of pneumonia.As the mystery illness spread in one of China’s major industrial hubs, some tried to warn their colleagues to take extra care at work, because the disease resembled Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the deadly respiratory disease that had killed hundreds of people across the region in 2002-03 after a government cover-up.One of those who tried to raise the alarm, though only among a few medical school classmates, was a 33-year-old Chinese ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang. Seven people were in isolation at his hospital, he said, and the disease appeared to be a coronavirus, from the same family as Sars.In early January he was called in by police, reprimanded for “spreading rumours online”, and forced to sign a paper acknowledging his “misdemeanour” and promising not to repeat it.Many early cases were linked to the city’s Huanan seafood and fresh produce market, which also sold wildlife, suggesting that the first cases were contracted there.Scientists would discover the disease had probably originated in bats and had then passed through a second species – in all likelihood, but not certainly, pangolins, a type of scaly anteater – before infecting humans.But the infections were soon spreading directly between patients, so fast that on 23 January the government announced an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan city and the surrounding Hubei province.Two weeks later, on 7 February, Li, who had contracted coronavirus himself, died in hospital from the condition about which he had tried to raise the alarm. He had no known underlying conditions and left behind a wife and young child.Li became the face of the mysterious new disease. The story of his death and pictures of him in a hospital bed wearing an oxygen mask made media headlines across the globe, including in the UK.The world, it seemed, was slowly becoming more aware of how lethal coronavirus could be, that it was not just another form of flu with fairly mild symptoms.But while UK scientists and medical researchers were becoming more concerned, and studying the evidence from China, those among them who were most worried were not getting their messages through to high places.The Conservative government of Boris Johnson had other more immediate preoccupations at the start of this year.Johnson was still basking in his general election success last December. After he returned from a celebratory Caribbean holiday with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, the political weather for the prime minister seemed to be set fair. It was honeymoon time.Three and a half years on from the Brexit referendum, the UK was finally about to leave the EU on 31 January. The fireworks and parties for the big night were being planned, the celebratory 50p coins minted.Minds were certainly not on a developing health emergency far away, as Johnson prepared to exploit the moment of the UK’s departure from the European Union for all it was worth. “I think there was some over-confidence,” admitted one very senior Tory last week.The prime minister and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, wanted to make an early impression at home in other ways too, as domestic reformers. Cummings was waging a war on civil servants in Whitehall, throwing his weight around and deliberately upsetting the Westminster applecart.While he made the headlines, briefing about his iconoclastic ambitions, Johnson was preparing a big Cabinet reshuffle to assert his own authority in other areas now Brexit was done and dusted.With Labour effectively leaderless after its fourth consecutive election defeat, there was little opposition to trouble Johnson on any front at all – and certainly no-one of note asking tough questions about coronavirus.The prime minister duly recast his cabinet team on 13 February – five days after Li’s death in Wuhan. He made big changes but unsurprisingly retained the hitherto safe pair of hands of Matt Hancock as his health secretary.In a sign of where priorities lay – and the lack of concern that a potential crisis might be heading our way from the east – Hancock wasted no time recording a video of himself grinning with delight on reshuffle day.He smacked his right fist into his left palm saying he could not wait to “get cracking” and that he relished the chance to deliver the Tories’ manifesto promises, reform social care and improve life sciences. And lastly, in a more sombre voice, he spoke of “dealing with coronavirus and keeping the public safe” before adding, as the grin returned: “Now let’s get back to work!”It is perhaps too early to conclude for sure that Johnson, Hancock and the government’s entire team of scientific and medical advisers were caught asleep at the wheel. But the fact that Johnson and Hancock themselves, in common with much of the Downing Street staff, would go on to contract the virus or suffer symptoms, further suggests that people at the top had not been sufficiently on their guard.Now, 11 weeks on from the first cases being confirmed in the UK on 31 January – a period during which more than 14,000 people (and probably several thousands more once care home fatalities are counted) in the UK have died from Covid-19 – and with the country in lockdown, the economy facing prolonged recession as a result, schools closed, and no sign of an end in sight – hard questions have to be asked.We already know with some certainty that other countries, such as Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand, will emerge from this crisis having performed far better than the UK. A few weeks ago the government’s advisers crassly said that fewer than 20,000 deaths would be “a very good result” for the UK.As we fast approach that grim tally, many experts now believe the UK may come out of this crisis, whenever that may be, with one of the worst records on fighting coronavirus of any European nation. Once the full tally is counted, few expect the number of deaths to be below 20,000.By contrast, on Friday, Germany was saying it thought it had brought coronavirus largely under control. It had had 3,868 deaths, less a third of the total in the UK (and Germany’s population, at 83 million, is far higher), having conducted widespread testing for Covid-19 from early on, precisely as the UK has failed to do.How, then, did it come to this? How did coronavirus spread across the globe, prompting different responses in different countries? Did the UK simply fail to heed the warnings? Or did it just decide to take different decisions, while others settled on alternative actions to save lives?David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19, says one thing is for sure. All governments were warned how serious the situation was likely to become as early as the end of January. Ignorance of the danger that was coming can be no excuse. Yet it would not be until late March – later than many other countries – that Johnson would announce a complete lockdown.“WHO had been following the outbreak since the end of December and within a few weeks it called a meeting of its emergency committee to decide if this outbreak was a ‘public health emergency of international concern’,” said Nabarro.“That is the highest level of alert that WHO can issue, and it issued it on January 30. It made it very clear then – to every country in the world – that we were facing something very serious indeed.”Well before the end of January, the WHO had been tracking the growing threat minutely: 14 January was a key day in the spread of the disease that would become known as Covid-19. The first case was confirmed outside China, with a woman hospitalised in Thailand.A WHO official warned then that it was possible that human-to-human transmission had occurred in families of victims – a sign that the disease had potential to spread far and fast – and, inside China, officials were quietly told to prepare for a pandemic.There was little international attention on the day, though, because Beijing’s dire warnings about a pandemic were made in secret, and a WHO spokesman rowed back from his colleague’s claim.Officially, China had not seen a new case of the coronavirus for over a week the outbreak appeared to be fading. It took another six days for China to publicly acknowledge the gravity of the threat, time that scientists believed meant a further 3,000 people were infected.But on 20 January, officials announced more than 100 new cases and admitted the virus was spreading between humans, a red flag for concern to anyone who works on infectious diseases. The virus could no longer be contained by finding the animal source of the infection and destroying it.Two days later, the scale of the challenge was made clear to the general public when Beijing locked down millions of people. All transport into and out of the metropolis of Wuhan was cut off, an unprecedented modern quarantine that would come at huge human and economic cost.On 29 January, the UK would have its first two confirmed cases of the disease. There was little sense that China’s dilemma and its approach – shut down life as we know it or watch the death toll spiral out of control – might have to be our nightmare within weeks.In early February, Donald Trump announced a ban on travellers who had passed through China in the previous 14 days. Europe began focused testing of people with symptoms and travel histories that linked them to the disease, but little else.Johnson, it seemed, still had Brexit and free trade much more on his mind. Any hint of draconian action to fight coronavirus that might hurt the economy was the last thing he was entertaining.In a speech on Brexit in Greenwich on 3 February, he made clear his views on Wuhan-style lockdowns. “We are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric,” he said, “when barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage.“Then, at that moment, humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion of the right of the populations of the Earth to buy and sell freely among each other.”By early March it was abundantly clear to many academics and scientists that the approach being adopted by the UK was markedly different from those followed by other countries. From South Korea to Germany, governments had invested heavily in expanding testing capacity from the first weeks of the epidemic.Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore had brought in controls on travellers from infected regions and strict contact tracing to help understand who could have been exposed, inform them and require self isolation. Face masks became widespread in east Asia, long before it was recommended elsewhere.Testing and contact tracing has been at the heart of the approach advocated by the WHO, so that countries can establish how transmission chains were occurring, in order to break them.Many also brought in some social distancing measures, banning large gatherings, closing schools or extending holidays, and encouraged those who could do to work from home. None were as extreme as China’s shutdown, or the European and American lockdowns that would follow.Writing in the Observer last month, Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Ediburgh, noted the distinct UK approach. “Rather than learning from other countries and following the WHO advice, which comes from experts with decades of experience in tackling outbreaks across the world, the UK has decided to follow its own path. This seems to accept that the virus is unstoppable and will probably become an annual, seasonal infection.“The plan, as explained by the chief science adviser, is to work towards ‘herd immunity’, which is to have the majority of the population contract the virus, develop antibodies and then become immune to it. This theory has been widely used to advocate for mass vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella. The thinking is that, if most of the population is vaccinated, a small percentage can go unvaccinated without cases emerging.”It was not just the UK whose politicians and scientific advisers were, arguably, slow to act in the early stages. Others countries, including Spain and France, were caught out too, but it was Italy’s tragedy that alerted Europe to the scale of the threat it faced.European governments and citizens were forced to reckon with the reality that in an age of global travel, the thousands of miles separating them from China meant almost nothing at all. Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy the week that it shut down. They were advised to go into self-quarantine on return, but were not registered by the health authorities, nor were their contacts tracked.Italy and the UK had both had had their first case a day apart at the end of January, but cases rose faster in Italy. The country may just have been unlucky that carriers of the disease flew to its northern cities and ski resorts rather than to other European capitals.Whatever the reason, cases and then deaths started climbing sharply in northern Italy in late February. Dozens of towns were locked down from the 21st, but in the rest of the country life carried on as normal.It was soon clear that the problem had not been contained. On 8 March, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, quarantined 16 million people across the north of the country, and the next day extended the lockdown to all of Italy.The measures saved lives, but came too late for thousands of Italians. The death toll outstripped China, and the world looked on horrified as hospitals were overwhelmed, doctors forced to choose who should have a chance on a ventilator and who should die. On 11 March, the WHO declared a global pandemic. On 14 March, Spain went into lockdown, and three days later France did the same.But in the UK there appeared to be greater reluctance to act decisively with lockdowns: the banning of mass gatherings and the closure of pubs and restaurants. The government’s scientific and behavioural science advisers were warning ministers that the public might react badly to draconian measures and would not tolerate them for long.In an apparent show of defiance against the lockdowners, Johnson and Symonds attended the England v Wales rugby match at Twickenham on 7 March. The Cheltenham Festival, attended over three days to 13 March by 250,000 racegoers, was allowed to go ahead.The tone was about to change. In a Downing Street press conference on 12 March, Johnson, who had said a few days before the first UK death that the disease was “likely to spread a bit more” suddenly became the deliverer of grave warnings.Previous talk by his advisers of avoiding lockdowns and developing “herd immunity” had been banished and replaced by a brutal honesty. “I must level with you,” Johnson told reporters. “More families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time.” On 18 March – just days after Downing Street had suggested it was not on the cards – the government announced the closure of all schools until further noticed. Pubs and restaurants were ordered to shut on 20 March. The UK had come late into line.One former cabinet minister last week described the change of approach as a “screeching U-turn”. Johnson and his ministers were now, even more than before, taking cover behind, and advice from, their scientific and medical advisers. Many of these advisers had become increasingly concerned that the UK had become out of step with other countries because of political resistance from ministers to measures that would hit the economy. The Observer has been told that at least two senior government advisers were on the brink of of quitting before Johnson switched his approach.The government has found itself unable to escape the consequences of a wider failure to prepare. As hospitals threatened to be overwhelmed before orders were given to massively expand capacity, ministers came under intense criticism over the lack of protective equipment for frontline NHS staff, over the lack of ventilators for patients in intensive care, and for a failure to test more widely for Covid-19, particularly among NHS workers.The lack of preparedness and instances of chaotic planning has shocked many in and outside the NHS.Last week, Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, the professional body for intensive care practitioners, said the minimum specifications for the government’s own homegrown ventilator scheme would produce machines that would only treat patients “for a few hours”. “If we had been told that that was the case… we’d have said: ‘Don’t bother, you’re wasting your time. That’s of no use’,” she told the Financial Times.Last month the government missed an EU procurement deadline for ventilators because, minister said, an email went unnoticed. The NHS had said 30,000 more would be needed, Hancock reduced this to 18,000. Pittard said her faculty had been warning for years about a shortage of intensive care capacity and intensive care nurses in hospitals.Normally each intensive care patient would have one intensive care nurse in attendance all the time, she said. Now there was one nurse to six patients, although other staff had been redeployed to intensive care units to plug the gaps and the new system was working because of heroic efforts. Although she was reluctant to criticise the government, she said that if the faculty had been listened to, “we wouldn’t be starting from this place”. Germany, she pointed out, has 29 intensive care beds per 100,000 people, compared with six in the UK.The Tory MP and former health minister Dan Poulter, who works part-time in the NHS, said that given the enormity of the challenge facing government “it almost seems wrong to be critical”.But he believes part of the problem is that insufficient advice has been sought from experienced NHS clinicians who would have warned of problems with PPE early on, of the shortage of ventilators and would have told ministers of the urgent need to test NHS staff.“An early over-reliance on academic modelling also resulted in a lack of experienced frontline NHS clinicians – in other words, the people who really understand the day-to-day challenges our hospitals and health service face – from feeding into the initial Covid-19 action plan,” he said. “This has manifested itself amongst other things in the slowness of providing adequate PPE for frontline NHS staff and in the lack of virus testing for healthcare staff in the earlier part of the outbreak.”When the investigations into the UK’s response to Covid-19 come to be written, there is widespread recognition among experts that this lack of long-term strategic planning will be at the centre of it. So too should be the need to ensure that the views of experts are fed into government more efficiently and widely. The prospect of a previously unknown disease spreading catastrophically around the globe and infecting millions is, after all, not a new one.Indeed, many warnings have been given in the past about the viral dangers facing humanity. “Given the continual emergence of new pathogens ... and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal pandemic will occur in our lifetime,” Bill Gates predicted several years ago. “And it will have the impact of a nuclear war,” he warned, while urging nations to start stockpiling antiviral drugs and therapies. If only.For its part, the WHO prepared – several years ago – a list of viruses with no known treatments or vaccines, illnesses that could one day trigger that pandemic and kill hundreds of thousands. Prospective killers included nipah disease and lassa fever as well as an ailment it simply called “disease X” – “a serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown”.As to the most likely nature of that mysterious virus, most modelling assumed that disease X would be flu-like in behaviour, says Dr Josie Golding, the epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust. After all, influenza had caused so many deadly global outbreaks in the past. As a result, a lot of investment went into making influenza vaccines in preparation, she says. “But have we been thinking about diseases other than influenza that might become pandemics? I don’t think we have. There has been a real gap in our thinking.”Then came the appearance of Covid-19 – caused not by a strain of influenza but by a coronavirus – in November. Initially, only a few cases were highlighted, a trend that began to change early this year with a rise in numbers of infected ill people.“The report that really grabbed my attention came out in mid-January,” says epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University. “It said 41 cases of this new respiratory illness had now been diagnosed in one small area of China, around Wuhan. And that set the alarm bells ringing for me.”For Woolhouse, the cluster of cases in one place showed this was not a matter of a few people scattered around China picking up an occasional infection from an animal such as a bat or a chicken. “Forty-one cases in one small area at the same time could not be explained that way. People are not picking this up from animals, I realised. They are actually spreading it to each other. It was already heading out of control.”Ewan Birney, head of the Cambridgeshire-based European Bioinformatics Institute, part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory network, also noted the significance of the new disease at the time. “I presumed, at first, that this one would also burn itself out, probably somewhere in Asia,” he says.Then there was the infectiousness of the new virus. A person with Sars generally starts to display symptoms before they infect other people. That makes it much easier to contain. But this was not the case with Covid-19. Early data from China – again released in January – showed the virus was being spread from people who were displaying only the mildest symptoms, or in some cases no symptoms. This was making the condition very difficult to track, says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.“At that point I realised this outbreak was going to be very serious,” he added. “I sent a tweet to a colleague in Australia. It simply said: ‘This one is out of the bag properly’. He sent one back agreeing with me.”Around this time, Paul Nurse, Nobel laureate and head of the Francis Crick Institute, recalls attending a conference where he met Mark Wolpert, head of UK Research and Innovation, the organisation that funds a vast slice of British scientific research.“He had just received a text message from a colleague about the outbreak and we started to discuss the implications,” Nurse recalls. “It did not take us long for us both to realise this was going to be very significant. It took another two or three weeks to confirm these worst fears – by mid-February.”By this time, Birney had realised the virus had a real sting in its tail and could cause serious illness among the elderly and those with other underlying serious ailments. “It was half-term and I was on holiday with my parents. All I wanted to do was to get the holiday over and then get them back to their house in the country where they could keep themselves isolated.”Britain was still doing quite well in containing the disease by testing, tracing contact and setting up quarantine for those suspected of being infected with Covid-19 at this time. “Then, in March, the government decided to abandon this approach and shift from containing the disease to delaying its progress,” says Wingfield. “I would really like to know why the decision to give up testing and contact tracing was taken.”Many other researchers also question why the government took so long to react to their warnings. “Part of the trouble was there were other virologists who were saying this was going to be like Sars or flu and there was not too much to worry about,” says Ball. “But Sars happened in 2003. The world is much more connected now than it was then. More to the point, Covid-19 was also much more infectious than Sars. And so it started appearing in lots of other countries.“Perhaps some of us should have got up in front of BBC News and said you lot ought to be petrified because this is going to be a pandemic that will kill hundreds of thousands of people,” adds Ball. “None of us thought this was a particularly constructive thing to do, but maybe with hindsight we should have. If there had been more voices, maybe politicians would have taken this a bit more seriously.”“There is no question that we were insufficiently prepared,” Nurse says. “We had been warned a few years ago when reports made it clear that the UK was not ready to combat a major flu pandemic and we did not take up that warning. As a result, we were caught out.”He and many others say an inquiry into Britain’s Covid-19 preparedness will have to be held at some point but stress that this should not be started until the crisis has been dealt with in the UK.Professor Ian Boyd, a former chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, agrees. “There is a great danger there will be a lot of looking back with the benefits of hindsight and poking fingers of blame,” warns Boyd. “But when you are in the middle of things you have to make a lot of very hard 50-50 decisions, and sometimes you make the wrong call. On the other hand, there is no harm in making sure that we learn as many lessons as we can.”Boris Johnson, after his own brush with death at the hands of Covid-19, will presumably no longer take the gung-ho attitude to illness that he has always has. A former Tory minister said: “If Boris had any sense he would take control of the inquiry and lead it.”One conclusion that experts are already drawing is that it was those countries close to China, with memories of Sars, or cultural ties to their neighbour, which were much faster to act in response to Covid-19. Perhaps most notable in its success was Taiwan. Closely linked by economic and cultural ties to mainland China, Taiwan could have been at high risk of a major Covid-19 epidemic. Tourists and business people travelled regularly back and forth.But helped perhaps by having an epidemiologist as vice-president, the government set up a gold standard regime of testing and contact tracing that means that nearly three months on from its first confirmed infection, it has registered fewer than 400 cases and six deaths.Taiwan’s extensive testing and thorough contact tracing are precisely the kind of action that the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is demanding before the UK lockdown is lifted. Hunt points out that it is one of the essential conditions set by the WHO to avoid a second wave resulting from an easing of restrictions.Hong Kong, which also suffered from the Sars crisis, also moved early to enforce quarantine and social distancing, as well as widespread mask wearing, and today has registered just over 1,000 cases and only four deaths.In late February, South Korea looked like it was on a trajectory to disaster, with the highest number of confirmed cases outside China, and numbers rising rapidly. But after the country’s first infection, the government met medical companies and urged them to start developing coronavirus test kits on a massive scale.The results were impressive. When the epidemic hit, it was ready to deploy largescale testing. Its measures allowed South Korea to become the second country to flatten its coronavirus curve, without the sweeping shutdowns of society and economic activity that China had pioneered and the west would be forced to adopt.China’s experience should have provided a grim template for western countries to use to prepare. The speed with which Wuhan’s crisis had intensified showed that a relatively advanced medical system could be swamped. Within three weeks there were over 64,000 people infected and 1,000 dead.The pleas for help from Wuhan’s residents and doctors were to be echoed by those from Italy a few weeks later, and soon after the UK.Look back three months, and in China there were not enough tests to work out who had coronavirus, there was not enough protective equipment for medical staff treating patients, and then, soon, tragically there were not enough hospital beds and ventilators for sick patients. These are exactly the challenges faced by authorities from New York to Rome, London to Madrid.If the UK has serious questions to answer, the country that so far has seen the worst of the outbreak, the United States, was slowest of all to act. Trump for months ignored, played down or lied about the threat posed by coronavirus, leaving inidual states to act unilaterally as it became clear it had already taken hold on US soil.On 17 March parts of California issued “shelter in place” orders, effectively a lockdown. By the end of that week New York City had also shut down, along with a dozen states, and the majority of the rest of the country had put some restrictions in place. Only five states had few or no controls.There have now been nearly 700,000 confirmed cases in the US and over 33,000 deaths actual numbers are likely to be higher for both. The economy has also been devastated, with more than 22 million out of work as businesses collapse or shrink under the strain.Trump insists the US is turning a corner, and has tried to blame – among other targets – the WHO for failing to fully raise the alarm, and has stripped it of its US funding.There have certainly been questions about the organisation’s strong praise for China and the exclusion of Taiwan, which may have contributed to the delay in recognising human-to-human transmission was occurring. But it began daily briefings on 22 January and had declared a global health emergency by the end of that month.While initially sceptical about China’s distancing measures, it urged other countries to adopt them once there was evidence they were working. It warned about shortages of PPE over a month ago, and since the beginning of the outbreak has urged countries, including the UK, to “test, test, test” to contain the virus – a strategy followed by almost all countries that have managed to suppress it.A senior Whitehall source with detailed knowledge of the UK’s response and those of other countries said: “The fact is that those countries who knew a lot about Sars quickly saw the danger. But in the UK the attitude among politicians and also scientists was that it was really just some form of a flu. All the government’s pandemic planning was based on a flu scenario. And then it turned out to be something different and far, far worse and the response was completely inadequate.”And we are going to be living with the consequences for a long time. Don’t expect a vaccine to come to the rescue in the short term, says Nabarro. “For the foreseeable future, we are going to have to find ways to go about our lives with this virus as a constant threat to our lives. That means isolating those who show signs of the disease and also their contacts. Older people will have to be protected. That is going to be the new normal for us all.”• This article was amended on 19 April 2020 to restore a section of a quote from Boris Johnson’s 3 February speech that had been lost during the editing process.

The global death toll has reached 162,070, while the total number of infections worldwide is at 2,356,475.As of 5pm Saturday, of those in hospital in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus, 16,060 had died, the Department of Health and Social Care said.New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the total number of Covid-19 hospital cases was down to 16,213, the sixth consecutive day that the number has dropped. On Saturday, 507 people died with coronavirus across the state, bringing the overall death toll to 13,869.There were 433 more fatalities from coronavirus in Italy on Sunday, 49 fewer than on Saturday, taking the death toll to 23,660. The number of people currently infected went up by 486, a rise of 323 fewer than on Saturday.The number of people with coronavirus in hospitals in France declined for the fifth consecutive day, while the number of people in ICU units fell for the 11th consecutive day. The country’s total death toll in hospitals and nursing homes has risen to 19,718 from 19,323 on Saturday.Chile has announced that the number of coronavirus cases in the country had passed 10,000, the third highest tally in Latin America after Brazil and Peru.

Some policymakers believe that extreme caution is required to avoid undoing the positive work and provoking a fresh outbreak. Others point to the increasing economic costs of lockdown measures and say the low number of cases and deaths should allow a swift reopening, perhaps combined with continued closed borders to prevent the virus arriving from outside.“The numbers look good so far, but even the governments are not sure if there could be a surge ahead,” said Milan Nič, an expert with the Berlin-based German Council for Foreign Relations.The Czech health minister, Adam Vojtěch, announced last week that the country’s tough approach had prevented the uncontrolled spread of the disease and justified a cautious lifting of restrictions. The five-stage plan will begin on Monday with farmers’ markets, car dealerships and some other small businesses allowed to reopen for the first time since one of the earliest lockdowns in Europe was introduced on 12 March.In the final stage, tentatively scheduled for 8 June, all businesses would be allowed to reopen, including bars, cafes, restaurants and hotels. However, Vojtěch warned people against being lulled into a sense of false security and said officials would reimpose restrictions if there was a sudden surge in cases.As of Sunday morning, the country had recorded 6,657 cases and 181 deaths. Neighbouring Slovakia had just 1,161 cases and 12 deaths, making it one of the least affected countries in Europe.There may be several reasons for the low numbers, but the decisive one seems to be a speedy move to enforce lockdown measures. Border closures and restrictions on movement and gatherings were introduced much earlier than in countries further west. A concerted effort to persuade citizens in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia to wear face masks may also have helped.There has been criticism of the slow pace of moves to ease the lockdown, particularly among those in the service and tourism sector.“The number of cases has dropped significantly, but still the government is talking about opening most stores only in June, with quite a few restrictions remaining through the summer, including travel bans and significant limits on tourism activity,” said Tomáš Prouza, a former secretary for European affairs who now heads the Czech Confederation of Commerce and Tourism.In Slovakia, the prime minister, Igor Matovič, has faced criticism from within his government for the continued lockdown. Richard Sulík, the economy minister and leader of the pro-business junior coalition partner in the government, complained on Facebook, “We don’t destroy our economy for the 800 people who die of flu every year”, and questioned why the country was doing so over the much lower numbers for coronavirus.Matovič has promised to release a plan and timetable on Monday, but insisted that he would base it on the recommendations of epidemiologists, not economists.Nič said: “As countries with much higher infection rates start to discuss gradual relaxations, the paradox is that in central Europe, where the numbers are lower, we’re likely to see a much more cautious exit from lockdown.”Many countries in the region have imposed severe border restrictions and closed airports, and this may continue even after internal measures are relaxed.The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said last week that reopening the country’s borders was not a priority. This suggests there is little realistic hope of respite for the country’s beleaguered tourism industry, which until the coronavirus crisis was preoccupied with mitigating the effects of an excess of foreign visitors to Prague. Babiš said the industry’s focus should now switch to domestic tourism.Another part of the exit strategy is likely to involve masks. In both the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens have been obliged to wear masks for more than a month, with politicians leading by example. The newly elected Matovič gave one of his first press briefings in a mask in mid-March, and advised others to follow his lead. “Even a home-sewn mask made from old bedsheets or a T-shirt is much better than not wearing any,” he said. Television anchors have read the news in masks, and thousands of volunteers have sewn homemade masks to distribute for free.Roman Prymula, the Czech deputy health minister and an epidemiologist, has warned that the face mask requirement is likely to remain in force throughout the warm summer months.Other countries have since followed suit: Poland, where there is talk of a gradual easing out of lockdown measures in the coming weeks, made mask-wearing outdoors compulsory last week. Austria and some regions of Germany have also ordered the wearing of masks in public places."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bdfa650aef3c55db7800762260243637fe2d1cc/0_318_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8668721887ae2b0eeacd93c6927a6740","title":"dutch flower parks virtual tour brings its blooms to living rooms","story":"Keukenhof will showcase 7m plants to online viewers after coronavirus forces closureThe 7m bulbs were planted and now the flowers are in bloom: tulips, daffodils, hyacinths, orchids, roses, lilies and more. Everything is ready at the Dutch flower park of Keukenhof – everything, except the visitors.For the first time in its 71-year history, the renowned flower park in South Holland will not open to the public. Instead, managers hope to bring the park to the people via a virtual opening. Every week, three new videos are posted on social media showcasing the profusion of blooms in the English-style landscape park.“Hyacinths, they prefer to stand in the foreground and the tulip always wants to stand slightly neat, but the daffodil just does not care. No fuss, nice, cheerful,” says gardener André Beijk in one video as he praises his favourite flower.Another clip showcases the 500 tulip species that grow in the Willem-Alexander pavilion. It is a riot of peach-melba, cerise, orange and pale pink, with lily-flowered and parrot varieties of the best-known Dutch flower. Tulips exist in many colours, except blue or black, says another gardener, Michael van der Voet.“Corona came to Europe a few weeks ago and we quickly realised that would mean Keukenhof cannot open this year, which is very negative for us,” said Bart Siemerink, the park’s director. “The timing couldn’t have been worse.”Usually the park welcomes 1.5 million visitors from around the world during its eight-week season between March and May. This year it will not open for a single day.Siemerink said: “The park is looking astonishing at this moment. It’s the best spring ever. We created a team to try to bring Keukenhof to the people at home instead of people coming from all over the world to visit the tulips in Keukenhof.”Organisers released a 360-degree video tour of the park on Saturday, with a drone’s-eye view to follow in coming weeks.The virtual opening is a splash of colour in a torrid year for the Dutch flower industry. Since coronavirus struck Europe, millions of flowers have been destroyed and turned into compost.Last Monday half the day’s flowers went unsold at Royal Flora Holland, the largest flower auction house in the world. For the remainder, prices have crashed.The auction house does not own the flowers, while growers have pre-existing agreements to destroy unsold stock to preserve prices.Growers have given away 150,000 bouquets to healthcare workers and people living alone, said van Schie. The industry has also been urging people “to buy flowers not toilet paper” in a campaign slogan that riffs on panic buying in the early phase of the crisis. But growers have missed out on the most important season of the year, which includes Mother’s Day (in the UK), Easter, as well as gardeners’ spring planting.Van Schie said the sector was hopeful of government support but he worried about the fate of smaller growers among the 4,000 companies who cultivate 30,000 varieties of flowers and plants in the Netherlands. “It is important that not only the large companies but the small growers survive, because otherwise there will be less variety.”Keukenhof’s manager is confident the park will survive, despite the lack of income from this “disaster” year. He expects the park to open in 2021, but for now flower lovers will have to go online. “You miss a little bit of the atmosphere, you miss the fragrance of the flowers, but you can at least see all the tulips that we have at the moment,” Siemerink said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c2e8649d147a9e9f1f2b3d84cd1d4f62df94f31/0_69_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af77bb10ac85466ca1db0ecddf7af2e2","title":"israel and south korea to ease coronavirus lockdowns","story":"Countries erge on exit strategy as Europe’s coronavirus death toll nears 100,000European countries are erging on how and when to reopen their shuttered societies, as Germany, the Czech Republic, Norway and others prepared to lift some restrictions on Monday while France and Spain ruled out any relaxation for several weeks.The confirmed coronavirus death toll in Europe approached 100,000 on Sunday, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally, but infection rates continued to slow, heaping pressure on governments to start easing the economic and social burden of a weeks-long shutdown.Germany will permit small retail spaces to reopen from Monday alongside car dealerships, cycling stores and bookshops, though people will be urgently advised to wear masks while in public.Poland will reopen parks and forests from Monday, while children in Norway will return to kindergarten and open-air markets in the Czech Republic will be permitted to trade as part of a six-week strategy to gradually lift restrictions.In Spain, with nearly 200,000 confirmed cases and more than 20,000 deaths, authorities said at the weekend they would hold off on lifting one of Europe’s tightest lockdowns.“We have done the most difficult things and we have left the most extreme moments of the crisis behind with sacrifice and resilience, but these results are still not enough and still fragile,” said the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, in a televised address on Saturday evening.He said the restrictions would be loosened slightly to allow children time outside from 27 April. Spain’s Covid-19 death toll rose by 410 on Sunday, the lowest daily increase since 22 March.French officials said on Sunday that although the virus appeared to be under control there, the country’s strict lockdown would continue for at least another three weeks.“It is an epidemic unique in France in modern history and it is not finished,” said the prime minister, Édouard Philippe. “We are making progress against this epidemic. The situation is improving slowly but surely … but we are not out of the health crisis. To think the epidemic is behind us would be an error.”He added: “Our lives after 11 May will not be exactly the same as before the lockdown. Not at once and probably not for a long time.” More than 150,000 French people have tested positive for the virus and nearly 20,000 have died.Philippe said isolating positive cases, some degree of social distancing, an emphasis on washing hands, as well as “massive and quick testing” of those showing symptoms of the virus and their contacts was likely to persist even if restrictions were eased in May.“We have to learn to live with the virus,” he said. “We see the population is not immunised – it may be one day, but today it is not, the circulation of the virus has been restrained. Nor will we have a vaccine before 2021 … and at this stage there is no treatment that has been shown to work. That leaves us one instrument: prevention.”President Emmanuel Macron announced last week that schools would begin to open from 11 May, but Philippe said on Sunday they would do so gradually. He said the government was considering various options, including having half a class in rotation, or opening schools in areas where there have been few or no Covid-19 cases before others.After a week of slowing infection rates in Israel, the government there announced on Sunday it was easing the stringent quarantine measures in place for the past five weeks. It will allow the partial reopening of hardware, electronic and office supply stores, and group prayer outdoors – for up to 19 people, standing two metres apart – and extend the perimeter for exercise to 500 metres from a person’s home.Preschools, schools, hairdressers and shopping malls will remain closed, and people will continue having to wear a mask in public spaces, with fines for non-compliance.The country of 9 million has had 158 casualties and about 13,000 cases. The relaxed measures will be trialled for a fortnight and tougher restrictions reinstated if the infection rate grows again.Maharashtra, India’s worst-hit state with more than 3,600 confirmed cases among its population of 114 million, said some activity would be permitted in its least-affected areas while maintaining a strict lockdown in zones that have the most infections.South Korea reported only eight new coronavirus cases on Sunday and said it would loosen some of its lockdown restrictions.The prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, said the government would consider opening public outdoor facilities and would relax guidelines on the circumstances in which sports facilities and restaurants can open. Other measures that were due to expire on Sunday were extended until 5 May.South Korea has recorded 10,661 infections and 234 deaths. “We must not let down our guard until the last confirmed patient is recovered,” the president, Moon Jae-in, said on Sunday.The UK, which is still in the middle of its outbreak, has said it is too soon to give dates on easing its lockdown.Pushbacks against lockdown measures continue elsewhere, including in Brazil. In Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and the capital, Brasilia, people took to the streets calling for the resignation of politicians who had decided to implement strict controls.The president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been fiercely critical of the measures and on Thursday he fired his health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, who had defended physical distancing.Agencies contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8496277729900608d0a811f93041f17037c7214e/0_109_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7c04fa8d28b6ae2c2c90c33047d03ff","title":"take me to your lada cubas passion for a little russian box","story":"The rugged Soviet-era car is 50 years old – and in Havana, classic models still sell for the price of a houseLandy is a stylish man. He has an ageing crooner’s slicked-back hair, the short-sleeved cool of a Miami Beach architect, and a terrible, terrible Lada car.He’s my go-to chofer in Havana, which sounds a little grand, but it’s more economical than buying one of these babies, which will set you back £15,000. It’s also why, despite the windows having no handles (a wrench is passed back) and the rear seat containing a loose spring like an unkind proctologist, Landy fusses over it like a baby.For this little blue car completes his look. On this island better known for its American incredible hulks, it marks him out as a member of the Ladaocracia, Cuba’s revolutionary Lada aristocracy.It’s 50 years to the day since the first Lada ran off the production line in Tolyatti, a Russian company town – also known as Togliatti – on a bend in the Volga. That means it’s also three days until the 150th anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, whose centenary that moment celebrated.A collaboration between the Soviet state and Italy’s Fiat, the Lada was the vision of designers who set out to make these small cars virtually indestructible. The result was the Zhiguli, a bulked-up Fiat 124, that even poets have struggled to describe as anything other than “boxy”.The body was toughened, drum brakes installed and clearance was heightened, all to help with the Russian roads and winters. More crucially, the car – renamed for the world as the Lada – was easy to maintain. The “classic” Lada became one of history’s most manufactured vehicles, with around 18 million built.In the 1970s, Soviet support for Cuba was at its height. “The government gave Ladas to doctors, people working on the sugar farms, athletes, engineers, scientists,” says Hendy Cobas, of Cuba’s Club Amigos del Motor, which has 1,000 members.This set the owners apart from those with the leftover Chevy Bel Airs and Ford Fairlanes from before the 1959 revolution. A friend recalls going to nightclubs and seeing the smarter set beginning to jump into Ladas at closing time: “You knew their parents or grandparents were someone important.”Willy Hierro Allen, the 77-year-old editor-in-chief of the magazine Excelencias del Motor, recalls: “In 1978, I was running Transporte magazine, and it seems someone thought I deserved it. The vice-minister called and told me ‘you are going to have a car’. I felt really excited. The car was blue. I still keep it the same colour.”Cuba’s extraordinary ability to soften and sentimentalise swiftly went to work on the utilitarian runaround. “Almost any Cuban can change the spark plugs, and most can swap the brake pads and fuel pumps,” says Cobas. “Ladas are members of the family.” It’s a sentence everyone here uses.“I’ve seen modifications to the bodywork, new air inlets or extensions to make it closer to the ground, but, apart from music systems, these are always small,” he goes on. “We don’t feel good about making big cuts on a Lada’s bodywork, it’s like you are cutting somebody.”It’s easy to understand why people look after them. The last classic Lada arrived in Cuba in 1988, but AutoCubana, Cuba’s version of Autotrader, lists models from 18,000 Cuban convertible pesos (CUC) – about £14,500. Good ones sell for twice that. It isn’t love, though it’s the dearth of other cars. For that money, Cubans can buy an apartment in one of the best areas of Havana.Following perestroika, Lada’s vast parent company, AvtoVAZ, went through the upheavals felt by many Soviet state industries. Production plummeted and corruption flourished. While the classic Lada continued to be built, the wheels were coming off. In the mid 1990s, there were 130,000 Ladas registered in the UK, By 2018 there were just 179. Countries were imposing carbon emission laws and the Lada couldn’t make the grade. Only in Cuba, with its estimated 250,000 Ladas, did the smoke refuse to clear.“Here, we are responsible for caring for our cars,” says Hierro, the editor of Excelencias del Motor. “When you grow old your son comes saying ‘Dad, let me fix the car’, then your son has a son too, and with time he is the one in charge of the car. That’s how the Lada ended up becoming the car of the Cuban family.”Sadly, as Landy and I head out to the highway, it may be the lingering smell of exhaust fumes that triggers my nostalgia. My first car was a Skoda, the Czech equivalent of the Lada. My dad bought it for me, saying – and I still hope he was joking – that he’d got it cheap because the previous owner had suffocated in it.There’s only so much I can take. I have a second go-to chofer. Jesus is a more austere figure than Landy. He rents a modern Lada from the state, one of 320 built under AvtoVAZ’s new owner, Renault, that arrived here in 2017. It is an entirely different creature and, in truth, it’s far better for long journeys. As Jesus says: “It’s comfortable and has a large trunk.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4232650.1587300404!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"back to school partial reopening to be examined by health authorities simon harris","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhile secondary schools look set to remain shut for the remainder of the academic year, officials are monitoring the experience of  Denmark which reopened its primary schools last week. Photograph: iStockHealth authorities are to examine the potential of reopening primary schools on a limited basis, such as one day a week, in the summer.Minister for Health Simon Harris said officials will closely monitor the experience of other countries such as Denmark which reopened its primary schools last week.He cautioned that any decisions regarding easing current restrictions will be taken on the basis of public health advice.However, he said, on a personal level he saw there was merit in partially reopening primary schools if permitted by public health advice. Secondary schools look set to remain shut for the remainder of the academic year.Such a step would be positive for the mental health and wellbeing of students and parents, he said.“The issue of reopening schools is very much an open question,” he told The  on Sunday.“All issues in relation to easing any restrictions will be considered by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and will follow public health advice.”Current public health restrictions are in place until May 5th, at which stage they will be reviewed.Any easing of measures will depend on public compliance and the advice of public health experts.It is understood that if primary schools do partially reopen, it is more likely to be take place in June and would be subject to social distancing measures.In Denmark, for example, pupils’ desks are spaced apart and children are required to wash their hands on an hourly basis. At break-time, children are only allowed out in small groups.Mr Harris also explained his personal views of why opening schools would be a positive development for children in an interview with the Sunday Independent.“I’d like to see a situation whereby our schools could come back or at least could come partially back. Now I can’t guarantee the timeline for this, but in terms of you’re asking me the hierarchy of things, I’d like to see comeback that would be one of them,” he told the newspaper.“From a socially distanced, safe point of view, meet their friends, and then go home. That would provide breathing space for families and information and I think that would help.”In response to Mr Harris’s comments, the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) said any decision to reopen primary schools must be led by public health advice.“Engagement with workers and their unions must take place in advance of any such decision,” an INTO spokesman said.“The health and safety of teachers, pupils and parents must be guaranteed before our schools reopen. We should look closely at the small number of jurisdictions where some schools have opened and endeavour to avoid repeating any mistakes that may have been made elsewhere.”The spokesman added that primary teachers were ready to resume facilitating the continuity of learning remotely from Monday, following the Easter holidays.School managers, teachers’ unions and other education partners, meanwhile, are meeting with the Department of Education on a weekly basis between now and the end of May to discuss issues relating to supporting students and the State exams.Sources say the possibility of secondary schools opening later than normal in September and on a staggered basis has been discussed.This could allow for classes to attend for part of the week and to continue remote learning for the rest of the week.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4232723.1587308284!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nearly 200 signs of otter activity recorded across dublin s rivers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOtters are a protected species under the EU habitats directive and Ireland is required to monitor and conserve otter populations. Photograph: Getty ImagesNearly 200 signs of otter activity have been observed around Dublin’s rivers and streams over the past two years, new research commissioned by Dublin City Council has found. The Dublin Otter survey, carried out over two years between 2018 and 2019, found 196 signs of otters across 84km of watercourses including the rivers Mayne, Santry, Naniken, Tolka, Liffey, Camac, Poddle, Dodder, Owendoher, Little Dargle and Slang.The research was also carried out around the Whitechurch, Wyckham and Elm Park streams. While otters are shy animals that mainly come out at night and can be difficult to find, their presence can be spotted through a range of signs including spraints (droppings), latrines (regular spraint sites), slides (worn areas where otters enter the water), couches (resting areas) and holts (burrows). Otters are a protected species under the EU habitats directive and Ireland is required to monitor and conserve otter populations.The Dodder and Tolka rivers were found to be the most heavily marked with otter signs while in other areas, such as the Naniken in St Anne’s Park, no otter marks were recorded. The study found the rivers of Dublin remain “highly important passageways for wildlife and also important breeding areas for otter” proving that otters can “continue to survive in densely populated areas such as Dublin”. The rivers examined during the study are “some of the last remaining secluded habitats in cities that are becoming increasingly fragmented”.The authors of the report, Bill Brazier and Ross Macklin, also noted that while its commonly believed otters prefer to stay away from human activity, evidence from their research “isn’t quite that clear cut”.‘Substantial buffer’“We did find that the less-disturbed areas of the city’s rivers and streams featured more otter activity in general. Having said that, provided there is some substantial buffer, such as mature tree lines or inaccessible areas bounded by high walls, between the river channel and human disturbance, otters can be found in surprisingly urbanised areas.”New methods were used in the two-year research project including surveying the introduction of a new index to calculate levels of human disturbance to the otter habitats. City council senior executive parks and landscape officer Maryann Harris said the results of the study highlighted the need to conserve undisturbed sections of rivers for otters to breed while also reinforcing the council’s goal of the “re-naturalisation of river corridors”.“Otters are sensitive to encroachment by development and this study will better inform the management and conservation requirements for otter in the city,” she said.

The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

Photograph: Megan JelingerAFP via GettyGovernors in US states hardest hit by the coronavirus sparred with president Donald Trump over his claims they have enough tests and should quickly reopen their economies as more protests are planned over the extension of stay-at-home orders.New York continued to see hospitalisations decline to 16,000 from a high of 18,000, and the number of patients being kept alive by ventilators also fell. There were 507 new deaths, down from a high of more than 700 a day.“If the data holds and if this trend holds, we are past the high point and all indications at this point are that we are on a descent,” governor Andrew Cuomo said at a daily briefing, while urging residents to continue social distancing.“We showed you can control the beast. But it’s only half time. We still have to make sure we keep the beast down.”To get a baseline of how many people were infected with the novel coronavirus, Mr Cuomo said the state would do the most aggressive anti-body testing in the nation in the next week using a random sample.New York will test 2,000 people a day or 14,000 per week out of the 19 million residents in the state.The United States has by far the world’s largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 740,000 infections and over 40,000 deaths.It took the United States 38 days after recording its first fatality on February 29th to reach 10,000 deaths on April 6th but only five more days to reach 20,000 dead, according to a Reuters tally. The United States’ toll rose to 40,000 from 30,000 in four days after including untested but probable Covid-19 deaths reported by New York City.Mr Cuomo, along with other governors, are clamouring for more tests to detect new infections as well as to test for immunity as part of their plans to reopen their states.Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland during a CNN interview said claims by Mr Trump and vice president Mike Pence that states have plenty of tests were “just absolutely false.”Democratic governor Ralph Northam of Virginia told CNN the idea states have enough tests was “delusional”.The region of Maryland, Virginia and Washington DC is still seeing increasing cases. New Jersey reported on Sunday that its new cases rose by nearly 3,900, the most in more than two weeks. Boston and Chicago are also emerging hot spots with recent surges in cases and deaths.Several states, including Ohio, Texas and Florida, have said they aim to reopen parts of their economies, perhaps by May 1st or even sooner. The governors of Michigan and Ohio on Sunday said they could double or triple their testing capacity if the federal government helped them acquire more swabs and reagents, chemicals needed as part of the testing process.Economy guidelinesMr Trump’s guidelines to reopen the economy recommend a state record 14 days of declining case numbers before gradually lifting restrictions. Yet the Republican president appeared to encourage protesters who want the measures removed sooner with a series of Twitter posts on Friday calling for them to “LIBERATE” Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia, all run by Democratic governors.Governor Jay Inslee of Washington redoubled his attacks on Mr Trump’s call to “liberate” states, saying the president was encouraging people to violate state laws on self-isolating.“These orders actually are the law of these states,” he said. “To have an American president encourage people to violate the law, I can’t remember any time during my time in America where we have seen such a thing.”Demonstrations to demand an end to stay-at-home measures that have pummelled the US economy have erupted in a few spots in Texas, Wisconsin and the capitols of Ohio, Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia. More than 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits in the past month.Mr Trump had touted a thriving economy as the best case for his re-election in November.On Saturday, several dozen protesters gathered in the Texas capital of Austin chanting “USA! USA!” and “Let us work!”In Brookfield, Wisconsin, hundreds of demonstrators cheered as they lined a main road and waved American flags to protest at the extension of that state’s “safer at home” order.The demonstrators mostly flouted the social-distancing rules and did not wear the face masks recommended by public health officials.US lawmakers are very close to an agreement on approving extra money to help small businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic and could seal a deal as early as Sunday, congressional and Trump administration officials said.Congress established the program last month as part of a $2.3 trillion coronavirus economic relief plan, but it has already run out of money. -

For this reason, it is crucial that we all act now to follow current health advice. Washing your hands and staying at home means you not only reduce your risk of getting COVID-19, but you are also protecting others by greatly reducing the chances of the virus spreading further in the community.”The findings are in line with previous research in other countries showing that coronaviruses are seasonal in winter in temperate climates, with greater variation in tropical regions.A separate review from Yale University also found that the cold, dry air of winter helps coronavirus to spread among people. But as humidity increases during spring and summer, the risk of transmission of the virus through airborne particles decreases both outside and indoors in places such as offices.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uneasy alliance scientists government face coronavirus pandemic","story":"Looking back, it was a moment that Sir Patrick Vallance may now view as regrettable.As he articulated the government’s decision to pursue a policy of “herd immunity” to the television journalist interviewing him, the Chief Scientific Adviser stressed that it was only following “the most up to date and relevant advice” from the experts appointed to navigate a way through the unfolding coronavirus crisis.Herd immunity, he explained, would necessitate around 60 per cent of the country contracting the disease so that, once recovered, their bodies’ acquired antibodies would effectively protect the rest of the population, too.It was put to him that, with the virus having an estimated fatality rate of up to one per cent, that was potentially an awful lot of deaths to countenance. Sir Patrick couldn’t deny it.“That is a real prospect, this is a nasty disease.”Neither he nor his interlocutor spelled out the numbers, but anyone with an elementary grasp of maths could have deduced that achieving herd immunity might therefore cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. That interview was on March 13, a day after Sir Patrick, side by side with Boris Johnson, had first floated the idea of herd immunity at a press conference.The PM had also taken that opportunity to declare that people with mild symptoms of the coronavirus should self-isolate themselves at home for a week but stopped short of calling for the cancelling of mass gatherings or closing schools.It has now emerged that for nearly a fortnight the government had been privy to scientific advice from Imperial College, London, which had forecast mass casualties from the Covid-19 strain. Mathematical modelling of potential deaths had been made available as early as March 1, according to Professor Neil Ferguson, who led the Imperial team.Furthermore, on March 12, the date of the “herd immunity” press conference, Imperial had presented a further study to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) which predicted a quarter of a million fatalities in the UK unless truly stringent measures were taken to suppress the virus.Yet here was Sir Patrick, a day later, insisting that fully suppressing the virus with a lengthy lockdown was unhelpful as it would only lead to a second, potentially larger, outbreak towards the end of the year.“We want to…not suppress it so we get the second peak and also allow enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune to this to help with the sort of whole population response, which would protect everybody.”Sir Patrick may not have known it, but the ground was already shifting beneath him. According to insiders, the latest offering from Imperial had indeed made an impact and a seismic change in thinking was now taking place in the government’s inner circle. Actually seeing the numbers starkly on a page – 250,000 deaths unless we lockdown the country – had apparently concentrated a few minds.The result was that, even as herd immunity was being expounded on national television by the hapless Sir Patrick, the very real prospect of abandoning its pursuit of was now being actively considered in No10. The government was about to change direction, but it was hardly to be a handbrake turn.It was a full eleven days after the Imperial study’s call for full suppression before Mr Johnson announced that he was putting the country into lockdown. That was nearly four weeks ago, and since then the line from the government has been consistent: stay at home, only go out for essentials such as food or exercise and keep the vulnerable isolated.For now, it seems, the country is on a single, straight, Imperial-sanctioned path.Why did it take so long to get here? Is it definitely the right path? And how do we go from here, in an unsustainable state of economic stasis, back to something resembling normality? The key to understanding the first of those questions lies in the structure of the committees set up to advise the government in such times of crisis.SAGE, and the three sub-committees which feed into it, are comprised of a range of scientists, the identities of whom are largely unknown, apparently in order to protect them from threats. This opaque nature, and the fact that the committees are dominated by epidemiologists, behavioural scientists and particularly mathematical modellers, has led to criticism.Professor Anthony Costello, of University College’s Institute for Global Health, says: “I think that is quite a narrow view of science. You needed independent public health scientists, social health scientists, IT people, logisticians – and maybe citizen scientists – people that understand how you collect data on a large scale from communities and feed it back to them.”Until the pivotal Imperial report was acted upon, it had appeared to some that the government was actually most in thrall to the behavioural scientists. One report, submitted to SAGE on March 4, examined the potential public resistance to various anti-viral interventions, such as school closures, and concluded they would be “highly disruptive” and “likely to present an unequal burden to different sections of society.”Some committee members clearly felt it would cause to “discontent” to isolate only vulnerable people. But others said that explaining that the rest of the population was building herd immunity for them “will make this acceptable.”This kind of advice, together with the naturally liberalist instincts of Mr Johnson himself, seems to have contributed to the delay in bringing in lockdown.Prof Costello says of the Prime Minister, “He wants people to be pretty free. The thing that they didn’t realise was that every week’s delay on an exponential part of the curve can be a disaster.”Prof Costello points to other countries, such as Ireland, as examples of how more effective actions could have been taken earlier, as does Sir David King, the Chief Scientific Adviser between 2000 and 2007. Sir David says that allowing the Cheltenham races, as pictured below, in the second week of March, for instance, had been a clear error.His own son caught the coronavirus while attending the four-day festival, but has now recovered.“I do know Patrick Vallance rather well and have enormous respect for him and think he’s the right man in the right job. I cannot believe that Patrick, knowing what he knows about epidemics, would have said go ahead with Cheltenham.“I can’t believe that that was the science advice. A big crowd of jostling people all trying to lay bets and collect money at the same time, it’s just the formula for spread.”Sir David’s perception is that, unlike in his time as Chief Scientific Adviser, when he advised and politicians listened, now it is more like the other way round with scientific advisers kept on a tight rein. And having worked with Mr Johnson when he was London Mayor, he says, “It was very clear that he does want people to like him and as a scientist he certainly showed that he enjoyed listening to what I had to say, but I became aware that the next person walking into his office who said the opposite to me would get the same treatment.”Having finally opted for lockdown, the government is now being accused by some academics of having swallowed the Imperial study too readily and depending too much on the mathematical modellers.Professor Richard Sullivan, co-director of the conflict and health research group at King’s College, London, says, “They went from almost nothing, which was \u0027oh, we\u0027re going to ban a few mass gatherings here\u0027 to the full lockdown, just like that.”Prof Sullivan says that he has argued for the modelling to include the unintended consequences of the lockdown on public health, but that his pleas have been ignored. He fears those suffering from non-Covid-19 conditions will now suffer.“The mistake that was made was the models were not red-teamed properly, which means you give it to other people in other areas who model other indirect causes, you say what’s wrong with this model?...They were not exposed to a sufficient critique.”The problem with mathematical modellers, he adds, is that the modelling community in infectious diseases is a very closed and very small community. So if you get it right, of course you get it right, but if you get it wrong you can’t see you’ve got it wrong.”Whether Prof Ferguson at Imperial has got it wrong on Covid-19 remains to be seen, but certainly some of his past pronouncements over pandemics have appeared to fall well wide of the mark.His research that sparked the mass culling of farm animals during the 2001 epidemic of foot and mouth disease was disputed.In 2002 Prof Ferguson got involved in the BSE crisis, which had years earlier seen the then agriculture minister John Selwyn Gummer attempt to reassure the public that it was safe to eat beef by feeding a hamburger to his four-year-old daughter.Prof Ferguson authored a report speculating that BSE in cows and sheep could cause up to 150,000 human deaths: to date is fewer than 200. Three years later he aired the possibility of bird flu leading to 200 million deaths and then said in 2009 that swine flu could kill up to 4 million.The sum total of the death toll for both diseases was in fact around 19,000.Prof Ferguson, however, stands by the integrity of his modelling.As the debate over the justification for the lockdown goes on, now the government is also facing pressure over its insistence that the use of face masks for everyday use by the general public is unnecessary. The official line has been that unless you are in close contact with someone a mask is not going to make much difference and can, conversely, make people less careful about keeping their distance while making them more prone to touching their own masks and faces.But the Government is now considering revising its stance, following a prediction from David Nabarro, the World Health Organisation special envoy on Covid-19, that they could play a role in our eventual exit from the lockdown. He says, “I’m envisaging in the coming weeks and months that as people start trying to get back to what I call the new normal – the Covid-ready normal – they will be wanting to wear face protection.”He says that after the SARS outbreak in Asia “people used to tell me, one of the reasons they wear masks is they want to do everything possible to keep safe. The second reason is to show to others that they’re taking it seriously.”The exit strategy is very much on academic minds. For this part of the process, we should definitely not rely solely on the mathematical modellers, says Robert Dingwall, Professor of Social Sciences at Nottingham Trent University, and an advisor to one of the SAGE sub committees.“There is a space in the policy making that might be occupied by a combination of sociologists, political scientists and historians who have worked on previous pandemics…you could argue there is a gap in the system of expert advice for that kind of input.“Modellers are smart people but they’re mathematicians primarily and that’s why you need to set their advice into a social and economic context. That’s why you need to have an understanding of the real world.“Ferguson for example keeps talking about social distancing as a kind of all or nothing thing. Whereas if we’re going to talk about an exit strategy, there isn’t going to be a VE day where we declare it’s all over.”One problem, he says, is that “the government have ramped up the level of fear to a point where it’s very hard for people to hear the messages about ‘this is the way out’.” He describes the lockdown on parks, for instance, as “cruel and unjust.”“It’s a policy by people like me who live in houses with big gardens.“If the politicians are trying to follow the science, and the science is only giving them a limited range of input, then it might be quite difficult for some of these everyday considerations to get taken more seriously.Prof Sullivan echoes some of those points: I think the fear out there is extraordinary. Now, it’s our view that the fear is out of all proportion to the threat and the risk. There’s been a real perspective loss here.“I keep saying to people we have as many if not more people dying of pneumonia and loads of other conditions. I think life has to start renormalizing again with sufficient care and attention to the vulnerable.”In addition to the search for a vaccine, comprehensive testing of the population so that infected people – and anyone they have had contact with - can remain in isolation, will also be essential. Only then, it seems, can the rest of us – with or without masks – realistically hope to return to something resembling normality.But with the government struggling to even reach its projected target for the end of the month of 100,000 tests a day, that goal feels a long way off, as does a vaccine, which could take a year or even two to produce on the necessary scale. According to some scientists, the only other option might involve us coming full circle.Prof Sullivan says that, even after sorting out testing and the provision of adequate personal protection equipment, “I’m afraid it comes down to this problem of, are we going to wait for two years for a vaccine which may never happen?“Of course not. The British economy and society will be finished by then. So, your only option here is about building up herd immunity.”After all this, herd immunity?But then, as Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer told the media last week, “The thing about scientific advice is that it evolves.”Perhaps Sir Patrick won’t find he has anything to regret after all.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"better coronavirus testing may not have saved lives deputy chief","story":"Better coronavirus testing may not have reduced the UK death toll, the deputy chief medical officer has suggested, as she questioned whether it had helped Germany.Dr Jenny Harries has staunchly defended the government’s original approach, saying it was right to switch focus to managing people’s condition rather than testing, once the virus had got out of control in the community.It comes less than a week after Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, conceded more testing should have been undertaken.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference last night, Dr Harries described the initial “Contain” phase of the response, where testing of suspected cases was vigorously pursued, as “very successful”.She also said there was no evidence to connect German’s policy of continued aggressive testing with its significantly lower mortality figures.“We are at different phases of the pandemic” she said, cautioning that the rates of disease in Germany are starting to rise.“I think we have rather ended up with a conversation which is a demand on testing without necessarily seeing that causal link.”Whilst acknowledging that it is important to investigate the link between better testing and reduced death figures, she said: “I think the actual mechanism between the two is still not clear.”As of 9am on Sunday, 16,060 people have died in hospitals in the UK having tested positive for Covid-19, although many more have died in the community, including at least an estimated 7,500 in care homes.So far, more than 482,000 tests have been conducted, with 21,626 tests on Saturday.Germany had recorded 4,547 deaths from coronavirus as of yesterday.At the beginning of this month, Germany was conducting more than 50,000 tests a day, and as of April 15 it had conducted the highest number of coronavirus tests in Europe at 1,728,357.Dr Harries declined to say whether the UK had passed the peak of the virus.She said: I would be very tempted to offer a comment on that today but I\u0027m not going to be, for a number of reasons.She identified that the low number of deaths recorded today was positive but cautioned against reading too much into the figures, which are often retrospectively revised.She said: We could jump to all sorts of positive conclusions about that, but we shouldn\u0027t.I do think it is fair to say that we do know from the hospital data that we are starting to plateau across.But she added: If we don\u0027t keep doing the social distancing, we will create a second peak and we definitely won\u0027t be past it, so this is no reason to consider that we have managed this.But I do think things look to be heading in the right direction.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"german regions force citizens wear masks following success city","story":"The German government is under pressure to make mask-wearing compulsory in public after the success of a city-wide trial. Several German regions and cities sent a clear signal to Angela Merkel\u0027s government that they don\u0027t see its advice on face masks as adequate, with two states announcing inidual measures to enforce face mask usage.The eastern state of Saxony announced that everyone will have to wear a face mask as of Monday when entering shops or travelling on public transport. Wolfsburg, hometown of Volkswagen, and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania soon followed suit, announcing mandatory masks  in public starting the following week.Stephan Weil, state leader in Lower Saxony, said he was convinced that everyday face masks will soon become part of our pubic life and that they could be made compulsory on public transport as soon as we have enough stocks.”  The moves come after the city of Jena has seen new cases of the virus flatline since it brought in compulsory masks on April 6th. Sunday was the tenth day in a row that no new cases were reported there, although authorities have declined to say whether they believe the mask rule is primarily responsible.It came as Edouard Philippe, the French prime minister, promised on Sunday that face-masks would be widely distributed “within weeks” as the country prepares a gradual exit from lockdown starting on May 11 and said they would probably be compulsory on public transport. Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, said half a million masks would he handed out to the capital’s residents by the end of this month. She pledged that the more than 2 million people living in central Paris would receive free masks by mid-May, which will cost the city authorities €3 million (£2.6m).On Wednesday, while announcing a gradual relaxation of the country\u0027s lockdown, Ms Merkel stopped short of enforcing face mask usage in public, instead calling it a “strong recommendation.”  Stockpiles would not appear to be a problem, as the government confirmed earlier in the month that it had received delivery of 80 million masks while official guidelines make clear that using a scarf or a homemade mask is acceptable.Despite growing political pressure, a blanket mask requirement remains controversial among virologists. Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of the Bernhard Nocht Institute in Hamburg has called the debate misguided, saying that “we need to try and achieve a slow infection of the population, one hundred percent protection doesn’t help anyone.”In Spain, the government has announced that it is to fix the cost of face masks to prevent abusive pricing in a situation where demand has outstripped supply.Spain has struggled to import sufficient quantities of masks during the crisis, and last week the health ministry was forced to order the withdrawal of hundreds of thousands of FFP2 masks from hospitals after a batch, purchased from China, was found to be substandard.Security forces handed out up to 10 million face masks to people travelling to work in the days after the Easter weekend, when Spain’s economic lockdown was eased to allow workers in construction and other non-essential sectors to return to their jobs.Ministers have said that sufficient face masks will be available for the entire population to purchase from chemists this week with the national healthcare card, as in the case of prescription drugs.The CGCF pharmacies’ body has welcomed the move as the only way to “prioritise distribution to the most vulnerable”, but it also warned that as of Friday it had not been informed of any timetable for the rolling out of this system.Fernando Simón, the head of Spain’s health emergency department, said on Sunday that there was still no plan to make the use of masks obligatory. “The use of face masks is a recommendation, but it is just one of many ways to reduce the risk of contagion.”The Spanish health ministry announced on Sunday morning that 410 people had died of Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours, the lowest daily toll for four weeks. The death toll since the start of the country’s epidemic now stands at 20,453, with close to 200,000 confirmed cases.In Germany, where official figures put fatalities at the relatively low figure of 4,300, the pandemic is continuing to erode the popularity of the far-right AfD party and the Greens, both of whom had previously been performing strongly in polling. The AfD have fallen into the single digits for the first time in three years, while the environmental party have slumped from the low twenties to the mid teens as voters rally behind Ms Merkel’s CDU, who are widely viewed to be managing the crisis well.Meanwhile Berlin announced over the weekend the long-delayed arrival of the first refugee children from overcrowded Greek refugee camps. Some 50 children landed at Hanover airport, well below the figure of 1,500 promised by Berlin in March. The minors will now spend two weeks in quarantine.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"isil linked jihadis target mozambiques gas fields","story":"For more than two years the fighters waged a war so shadowy no-one really knew why they were fighting or even what they called themselves.They seemed to come out of nowhere, bands of masked men who attacked villages in northern Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado province, carried out mass beheadings and then vanished as mysteriously as they had appeared. Up to 1,000 soldiers and civilians have so far been killed by the group. Then, in the past few weeks, everything changed.No longer masked, the militants seized important towns and villages in a series of sophisticated operations launched under the noses of a Kremlin-linked Russian mercenary outfit.Unfurling the black flag of Islamic State in southern Africa for the first time, the fighters defiantly declared their intention to turn a region that will soon be vital to Britain’s energy security into a Sharia-based caliphate.Until recently, Cabo Delgado’s insurgency had garnered little attention in Western capitals.For many politicians, it seemed to be just another obscure conflict taking place in a chronically corrupt country with a long history of violence.But the latest attacks and the threat they potentially pose to what is becoming one of the world’s most important gas regions are causing a rapid and urgent reassessment.Until recently, the violence in Cabo Delgado had indeed seemed like a local affair.True, the group responsible for it had initially been dominated by foreigners, radical east African Muslims who fled down the Swahili coast after their leader, Aboud Rogo, was killed by police in Kenya in 2012. But they were rapidly able to find adherents among the local population.Cabo Delgado should be one of the richest regions in Africa. Not only does it boast the world’s largest ruby mine, it is home to a £44bn liquefied natural gas (LNG) programme — the continent’s largest ever energy project — that is being developed by some of the world’s biggest oil companies.With investment in the LNG project set to double over the coming decade, Cabo Delgado is turning Mozambique into an energy superpower, one of the ten largest producers of natural gas in the world.As Britain’s North Sea reserves dwindle, the UK is among those queuing up for a share of the region’s resources. Last year Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, entered into a joint venture to buy 2.6m tonnes of LNG from Mozambique a year for the next two decades.The mostly Muslim population of Cabo Delgado has seen little of the wealth, however. The region is by far the least developed in Mozambique and its 2.3 million people the poorest, making some ripe for recruitment.As its ranks swelled, the group -- which operated under a series of names, most commonly Ansar al-Sunna -- grew steadily bolder after launching its first attacks in 2017, culminating in its apparent adoption into the ISIL franchise at some point in the past six months.Increasingly worried by the group\u0027s growing capability, Mozambique’s government last year deployed 200 Russian mercenaries to Cabo Delgado from the Wagner Group, believed to be owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to Vladimir Putin.Although the Russians arrived with attack helicopters, drones and sophisticated weaponry they were swiftly forced to make a “tactical retreat”. As many as 12 Russians have been killed, according to diplomats.Success against the Russians seems to have emboldened the militants further.From mid-March the number of attacks has surged.In the most significant, militants marched into the port of Mocimboa da Praia on 23rd March and seized control of the town.  Although they marched out 24 hours later — replicating a tactic used by al Shabaab in Somalia and Isil fighters in the Middle East — they had made their point. Mocimboa da Praia is just an hour’s drive from gas fields.Amid a collapse in oil prices and economic uncertainty unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic, the escalation in the insurgency is making western energy companies increasingly anxious.The reaction to the jihadist occupation of some towns, with many locals coming onto the streets to cheer, will do little to allay their nerves.It is difficult to tell how genuine the support is. Stepping up their public relations campaign, the Islamists have sought to woo people by distributing stolen food and blowing up cash machines to dole out banknotes.But support may also be rooted in fear. “We don’t want to hurt you,” a militant leader told residents in one captured town, according to video footage. “If you do not report us to the police, we will live with you.”“But if you denounce us and tell the pigs where we are hiding, the next time we come here we will kill everything, even chickens and eggs, old people and babies.”The threats, Western officials say, are working because neither locals nor the energy companies have any confidence in the ability of the underpaid and demoralised security forces to stand up to the jihadists.Instead of fighting when towns were attacked, many soldiers and police officers have been ditching their uniforms and blending into the civilian population, locals say.Few therefore believe Mozambique’s national police commander, Bernardino Rafael, who claims that the situation in Cabo Delgado is under control and the insurgents are merely a handful of “criminals” who will soon be dealt with.“When armed men come, instead of defending the population, the police flee,” said Viana Magalhaes, a senior opposition politician.  “If a group of insurgents can take control of a whole province, then the country has no protection.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"london olympics supremo joins coronavirus top team ppe tsar","story":"Never has this seemed more apt than for his latest task: to steer Britain out of a crisis by tackling the shortage of protective equipment (PPE).This is a role which, according to the Health Secretary, will be akin to Lord Beaverbrook\u0027s wartime efforts to build aircraft.A former Treasury minister and investment banker, Lord Deighton, 64,  is married and has two sons. He is well regarded in Whitehall, and is seen as a doer who can get big projects off the ground. His role as chief executive of the 2012 Olympic Games was viewed as hugely successful by ministers who felt that he turned initial scepticism and uncertainty into a national triumph.He was rewarded by being appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2013 New Years Honours for services to the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Lord Deighton has described the seven years of total cynicism he faced as chief executive of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, adding that the experience hardened him for his ministerial role in the Treasury. After completing his schooling at Wallington County Grammar School and reading economics at Cambridge University, Lord Deighton embarked on a successful and highly lucrative career in the city.  He worked at Security Pacific National Bank and Bank of America before joining Goldman Sachs in 1983 where he remained for over two decades and was promoted to the roles of partner and chief operating officer for Europe.  After delivering the 2012 Olympic Games, he was brought in by the Government to kick-start negotiations on bringing new nuclear power stations to Britain.The Chancellor called me up during the Paralympics and asked if I\u0027d like to transfer some Olympic magic to the broader economy, he told The  in 2013.  In government, it\u0027s one thing to announce things and have policies – it\u0027s quite another to get them done.In his role as Commercial Secretary to the Treasury,   Lord Deighton led negotiations with the French nuclear firm, EDF.

Ronald Dahl, 25543.The rare first edition was a presentation copy gifted to John Alexander, who befriended Dahl when the pair served together during the Second World War.Experts believe Alexander helped come up with the plot for the book, which Dahl wrote for Walt Disney Productions. It featured mischievous mythical creatures - the \u0027Gremlins\u0027 of the title - which were often invoked by RAF pilots as an explanation of mechanical troubles and mishaps.In Dahl\u0027s story, the gremlins\u0027 motivation for sabotaging British aircraft is revenge of the destruction of their forest home, which was razed to make way for an aircraft factory. The principal character in the book, Gus, has his Hawker Hurricane fighter destroyed over the English Channel by a gremlin, but is able to convince the creatures as they parachute into the water together that they should join forces against a common enemy - Hitler and the Nazis - rather than fight each other.The copy, which is being sold by a relative of Alexander\u0027s, is expected to fetch up £4,000 when it goes under the hammer in an online auction - the date of which is yet to be confirmed because of the coronavirus outbreak.It includes corrections by Dahl in pencil, including two instances where Dahl has amended \u0027Barry\u0027 to \u0027Gus\u0027, and an arrow with the word \u0027No\u0027 pointing to a colour illustration of a gremlin next to a teapot.Jim Spencer head of Hansons\u0027 Library Department, said: The provenance for the item is established by descent from John Alexander to our vendor - who believes Alexander provided some inspiration for the plot.Most authors draw from their personal experiences and Dahl served as a pilot in the Second World War. The book was written for Walt Disney Productions in anticipation of a film being made but this never happened for various reasons.For any Dahl fan, and there are millions worldwide, this book is a remarkable collector\u0027s item. Not only does it take us back to Dahl\u0027s early days as a published author, that personal note provides an insight into the warmth of his character and regard for a wartime friend.Dahl joined the RAF in Africa in 1939, and was badly hurt when his plane crash-landed in the Libyan desert a year later. He was discharged from hospital in 1941 and became a fighter pilot, taking on the Luftwaffe above the skies of Greece until severe headaches caused him to be invalided home.He was subsequently sent to the British Embassy in Washington to help make the case for US involvement in the war in Europe, and became involved in sending intelligence back to London.While in the States, the writer C. S. Forester - who penned the Hornblower series and was working to aid the British war effort - asked Dahl to provide details of his RAF experience in North Africa, including his crash landing, which Forester hoped to use for an article in The Saturday Evening Post. Instead of the notes which Forester expected, Dahl sent a finished story - for which he was paid $900, a considerable sum of money at the time.The work led to The Gremlins, initially serialised in Cosmopolitan magazine, and a commission by Walt Disney for a feature-length animated film adaptation. The book publication consisted of a 50,000 print run for the US market, with Dahl ordering 50 copies for himself as promotional material, which he handed out to everyone he knew - including the British Ambassador in Washington Lord Halifax, and the US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who read it to her grandchildren.It was considered an international success with 30,000 more copies sold in Australia, but initial efforts to reprint the book were hampered by a wartime paper shortage. Copyright issues and the complicated involvement of the British Air Ministry delayed development of the proposed film, and after a year of story conferences and related research, Dahl realised that his book would be the only tangible product emanating from the project, despite Disney himself having a personal interest in The Gremlins.However, the incident failed to halt Dahl\u0027s career. He continued to write, selling a string of short stories to newspapers and magazines, with his next children\u0027s book - James and The Giant Peach - being published in 1961.A series of books that went on to become children\u0027s classic followed, including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Fantastic Mr Fox, Danny, the Champion of the World, The Twits, The BFG, and Matilda. Dahl\u0027s final book, The Minpins, was released in 1991, a year after his death. In total, Dahl\u0027s books have sold around 250 million copies worldwide.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us","story":"The line of cars stretched for more than a mile from the steps of Maryland\u0027s wooden-domed state capitol in Annapolis.Horns blared in protest for hours as signs and giant flags saying Trump 2020 No More Bulls--- were waved from windows.We want our city opened now! a middle-aged woman screamed from the passenger seat of an expensive white SUV. A girl, aged about 10, leaned out of her family\u0027s sedan with a handwritten sign reading Covid is a Lie!.Unlike recent protests in industrial states like Michigan and Ohio, the capital of Maryland was an improbable setting for an anti-lockdown rebellion.Annapolis, a genteel city of 40,000 on Chesapeake Bay an hour from Washington DC, is known as the sailing capital of America, and is home to the US Naval Academy.The average income is twice the national average. Unemployment has not previously been an issue.But this weekend\u0027s vehicle-based protest - called Operation Gridlock - mobilised middle class Annapolitans in numbers the organisers, a group called ReOpen Maryland, had never expected. Hundreds paraded through the city\u0027s narrow central streets. Many in American suburbia, it seems, have had enough.Protester David Thalheimer, 58, an engineer, stuck a large sign out the sun roof of his SUV quoting the poet Robert Frost. The best way out is always through, the sign said.It means you can\u0027t delay the inevitable, we have to just go through the virus, Mr Thalheimer said. “Sensible measures there can be, but what we have now is way too much. It\u0027s hitting the economy exponentially and we can\u0027t continue like this. They need to test people. Instead, they\u0027ve just done all this out of fear.Natalie Brown, 43, who runs a successful, though currently stalled, travel business, brought a sign saying This is 2020 not 1984.She said: It’s getting to be like an Orwell novel come to life. They\u0027re talking about tracking us for coronavirus. Google and Yahoo will be tracking and pinging us. It\u0027s all a total violation of our laws and constitutional rights.We need common sense and locking people up isn\u0027t common sense. A lot of people are suffering from mental health issues as a result. These are draconian measures and the state governors aren\u0027t listening. I think we\u0027re seeing a power grab by the governors.She added: Our governor doesn\u0027t like Donald Trump, so he\u0027s just doing the opposite of what Trump says. Trump says reopen, so he doesn\u0027t reopen.Most US states have imposed some form of lockdown measures and they remain popular.According to a Quinnipiac poll taken in early April, 81 per cent, including 68 per cent of Republicans, back a national stay-at-home order. But in recent days Americans who want an end to stay-at-home orders, like the one in place in Maryland, have felt buoyed by the president.He has encouraged states to liberate themselves, offering sympathy for protesters and tirades for, mostly Democrat, state governors who refuse to countenance a quick lifting of restrictions.This weekend other protests took place in the state capitals of Texas, Indiana, Nevada and Wisconsin. Larry Hogan, Maryland\u0027s governor, is a Republican, but he has been critical of Mr Trump\u0027s handling of the crisis.Mr Hogan is also chairman of the powerful National Governors Association. Andrew Coumo of New York is the vice chairman.ReOpen Maryland called on Mr Hogan to immediately end his closure of the state\u0027s businesses, schools and churches.They’ve lost their businesses, their livelihoods. This cannot go on. This is not sustainable. These are real people behind the numbers.Participants in the protest were advised to stay in their cars to avoid breaking Mr Hogan\u0027s ban on gatherings of more than 10 people.However, a small number did abandon their vehicles. They included a man in a Grateful Dead T-shirt, and no mask, who waved a giant US flag near the capitol.Another protester, a military veteran, said he was not scared of catching the virus and would rather die than give up my freedoms.As cars poured by the capitol\u0027s manicured lawns many Annapolitans made their feelings known through words painted on their windscreens.They wrote statements like The models are wrong, Legalise Church, We the people, Live Free or Die, and 1776, a reference to the Declaration of Independence.One man shouted through a megaphone: I’m not wearing masks to show my submission.Glen James, 60, who runs a business supplying fish to local restaurants, brought a sign saying Open Boating.He said: The government\u0027s gone way too far. I think Hogan believes fish have coronavirus.The marina\u0027s closed, they won\u0027t let us put a boat in the water. There are all these small businesses associated with boating, so we\u0027re all boat people.Maryland has suffered around 500 coronavirus deaths, and more than 12,000 cases so far. According to Mr Hogan the peak has not yet been reached.He will not reopen anything until daily figures have declined for at least 14 consecutive days, and testing capacity has tripled.So far, Maryland has lost 300,000 jobs in a month.Mr Hogan said he understood the protesters\u0027 anger. I\u0027m a lifelong small business guy. There\u0027s nothing more important to me than getting our economy back, getting people to work.Outside the capitol a lone counter-protester, Amy Windham 51, a health researcher, stood with a thick mask on her face, waving a Go Home sign at passing vehicles.They have they\u0027re right to protest and so do I, she said. But I think they\u0027re being irresponsible.“It’s unfortunate that people have lost their jobs, and we do need to open, but we need to preserve public safety first.She was interrupted as a woman wound down the window of a passing SUV and, without a mask, yelled You go home!Ms Windham said it wasn\u0027t the first, or worst, abuse she had received.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wolf seen northern france first time century","story":"A wolf has reportedly been seen and photographed in Normandy, near France’s Channel coast, for the first time in a century.European grey wolves re-entered France from Italy in the 1990s after being hunted to extinction in the 1930s. They have been spreading across the country, but none had previously been sighted so far north.The wolf was photographed at night by an automatic surveillance camera near the village of Londinières, in the Seine-Maritime department. The Prefecture said in a statement that experts at the French Bioersity Office, a state organisation that monitors the country’s wolf population, “have authenticated this observation as very probably being a grey wolf”.The sighting of a lone wolf is not surprising, the Prefecture said. Young wolves typically roam alone in spring, when they leave the packs where they were born to find a mate. “They can cover distances of several hundred kilometres in a few months before settling. The maximum distance from the place of birth can exceed 1,500 kilometres (1,350 miles),” according to the Prefecture.France’s wolves, estimated to number about 530, live mainly in the Alps, the south-east and the east of the country. Conservationists have welcomed the expansion of the wolf population but farmers are demanding the right to cull more of them to reduce attacks on livestock. Wolves kill thousands of sheep each year.The agriculture ministry, which is in charge of regulating the wolf population, set the quota allowed to be killed at 17 per cent in January.As an endangered species, the grey wolf is protected under EU law. Wolves have spread to every country in continental Europe, but France, Italy, Denmark, Latvia and Estonia are lobbying Brussels to allow farmers to shoot more of the animals, arguing that they threaten farming communities and livelihoods. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/17/17/macbook.jpg","title":"apple mac update battery charge life power","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Laptops may not charge up all the way all the timeApple is rolling out a new feature called battery health management that will change how laptops charge themselves.The update will mean that laptops may not charge themselves all the way up all of the time, if the computer believes doing so will protect the life of the battery.It aims to avoid a problem that means fully charging a laptop\u0027s battery puts a strain on it, because of the chemicals inside. Leaving a computer charged up in this way can therefore reduce its capacity, leading the battery life to fall over time.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInstead, if the computer believes that it is not likely to need 100 per cent battery in the future, it will only charge up some of the way. The computer will show that the battery is full, but it may not actually be.The feature can be turned off and may not be activated in all situations, Apple said. It will also ensure that the battery life is not significantly affected, the company said.Everything you need to know about the new iPhone SEA similar feature is already in place on Apple\u0027s iPhone, and was introduced in a recent update. It means that the phone will learn when it goes on charge at night and when you tend to wake up, for instance, leaving the final bit of charge until it expects you to get up and start using your phone.The Mac update will work in largely the same way, using its history of charging and battery use to notice times when you tend not to need the full battery life. If a computer tends to be used plugged in throughout the day, for instance, it may not charge up its battery fully.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

One researcher said it had the potential to be really, really stunning as it reached its closest point to Earth, in May.The comet that took 100 million years to pass EarthBut shortly after it became clear that the comet was actually distintegrating, getting dimmer as it did.As well as offering a chance to see the comet as it breaks apart, the images may prove useful to the scientists studying the object.

Frustration that the pandemic we are living through was predictable and preventable,” Mr Jermey writes.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe blunt acknowledgement by Mr Jermey\u0026nbspcomes amid increasing anger at home and abroad over\u0026nbspfailures by national governments to prepare\u0026nbspadequately for\u0026nbspthe infectious disease, which has so far claimed more than 150,000\u0026nbsplives globally.\u0026nbsp​“Humanity’s relentless exploitation of wildlife has been putting us at increasing risk of an event like this for decades. And this knowledge has not been some big secret, despite the rhetoric from various world leaders claiming this pandemic couldn’t have been anticipated,” Mr Jermey writes.\u0026nbsp”The truth is, we knew this was coming.”The message would\u0026nbspappear relevant for successive Conservative governments, which\u0026nbsphave been accused of repeatedly ignoring warnings\u0026nbspwithin “pandemic preparedness” documents over the past decade.To minimise the risk of future pandemics, Mr Jermey\u0026nbspcalls for the international community to focus on better regulation of so-called “wet markets”, such as the one in Wuhan largely considered the epicentre of the outbreak, and a renewed battle against the “illegal and unsustainable” wildlife trade.\u0026nbspOf the latter, Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent and Evening Standard, wrote last week: “From the financing of terrorists like Al-Shabab to the propagation of corruption and smuggling groups, this demand has done untold damage to the African continent.

It will also mark the final test before the spacecraft is approved for use, sending Nasa\u0026nbspastronauts to the International Space Station and beyond.Nasa veterans Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, who both took part in a number of space shuttle missions, will be carried up into space on a Falcon 9 rocket at 4.32am local eastern time, from Kenned Space Center. They will go for an extended stay at the space station, Nasa said, but the precise duration of the mission is yet to be determined.During the mission, they will test all parts of the Crew Dragon capsule, including the launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, and operational capabilities, Nasa said.Lifting off from Launch Pad 39A atop a specially instrumented Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon will accelerate its two passengers to approximately 17,000 mph and put it on an intercept course with the International Space Station, Nasa said. Once in orbit, the crew and SpaceX mission control will verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system and the maneuvering thrusters, among other things.In about 24 hours, Crew Dragon will be in position to rendezvous and dock with the space station. The spacecraft is designed to do this autonomously but astronauts aboard the spacecraft and the station will be diligently monitoring approach and docking and can take control of the spacecraft if necessary.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

By contrast, the new evidence suggests very clearly that the people of Nazareth lived purely Jewish lives – and kept to all the major ritual laws.The area seems to have been actively anti-Roman. In the year 4BC, an anti-Roman revolt is known to have broken out in the area – and rebels attacked the military arsenal and government treasury in the centre of nearby Sepphoris.Indeed, the archaeological investigation revealed that in Nazareth itself, in the middle of the first century AD, anti-Roman rebels created a sizeable network of underground hiding places and tunnels underneath the town – big enough to shelter at least 100 people.Religious Jews saw Roman and Greek influence as a serious and direct threat to their faith. Thus pious religiosity and anti-Roman politics often went together.The new archaeological investigation – the largest ever carried out into Roman period Nazareth – has revealed that Jesus’s hometown is likely to have been considerably bigger than previously thought. It probably had a population of up to 1,000 (rather than just being a small-to-medium sized village of 100-500, as previously thought).No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“Our new investigation has transformed archaeological knowledge of Roman Nazareth,” said Dr Dark, who has just published the results of his research in a new book Roman-Period and Byzantine Nazareth and its Hinterland.“For the first time ever, we are now gaining a reasonable understanding of the sort of place Nazareth was in Roman times.”By examining in detail all the archaeological evidence, gained from recent landscape-survey work and from a detailed re-analysis of previous excavations, we are now beginning to learn about the cultural and economic environment in which Jesus grew up,“ Dr Dark told The Independent.One of the most significant revelations to have come out of Dr Dark’s investigation is the fact that the farmers of Nazareth seem to have had a prohibition on the use of human manure as a fertiliser, in contrast to the people of Sepphoris and potentially many other areas. Field surveys by the archaeologists have revealed that, about halfway between the two towns, there is an abrupt change in the agricultural strategy.The discovery is significant because different Jewish groups took very different attitudes to human excrement. Mainstream religious Judaism took the view that such excrement was unpleasant, rather than ritually impure. Their only prohibition on the subject was that people should make sure that human excrement should be at least four cubits (almost 2 metres) away when prayers were being recited.However, an ultra-religious Jewish sect called the Essenes (and potentially, therefore, other extreme groups) did regard excrement as rituallyspiritually impure and unclean, as well as being merely physically unclean and unpleasant. They took the view that all human excrement must be buried so as not to offend God’s “ine rays of light”.The fact that the people of Nazareth seem to have had a strict prohibition on the use of human excrement as a crop fertiliser implies therefore that they too regarded it as ritually impure, rather than simply unpleasant.It therefore suggests that they were, in some ways, either aligned with aspects of Essene thinking or with the thinking of another similarly hard-line religious movement within Judaism of the first century AD.However, in other aspects of their material culture, the people of Nazareth were totally in line with other, more mainstream forms of pious Judaism.The archaeologists have found numerous fragments of stone bowls and cups in and around Nazareth: a fact that strongly suggests a high degree of traditional religiosity in the town.Religious Jews of the first century AD believed that stone vessels were immune to ritual and spiritual impurity in a way that ceramic and wooden vessels were not.So to keep themselves and their homes ritually clean, they often preferred to use stone vessels.The belief is stated quite clearly in chapter 10 of the Mishnah, the Roman-period compendium of Jewish tradition and law that was later incorporated into the Talmud. Indeed, the use of stone vessels for ritual washing is also referred to in chapter 2 of St John’s Gospel. Frequent hand-washing – after sleeping, before eating bread, before worship – was, and still is, an extremely important aspect of strict traditional Jewish religious life.However, religious Jews of Jesus’s time may also have been reluctant to use manufactured goods that may have been rendered ritually impure during their manufacture: for instance, by having been placed near non-kosher food or near to a dead body or by having been handled by a woman during menstruation.This fear may well be behind the type of ceramics used in Nazareth.Archaeological sites in Arizona threatened by Trump’s border wallWhy archaeological antiquities should not be sold on the open marketArchaeologists have found thousands of fragments of pottery in and around Nazareth. In contrast to the pottery of Sepphoris, however, it is virtually all of one type: a\u0026nbsprough ware, made in a Jewish village called Kefar Hananya, 23 miles to the north of Nazareth. Interestingly, archaeologists have found that the distribution of stone vessels and Kefar Hananya pottery in first-century Palestine seems to correlate. It’s likely that religious Jews were taking no chances with their domestic utensils, and made sure that their pots came from strictly religious Jewish sources that could be relied upon to keep them ritually pure during manufacture.The newly emerging picture of Roman-period Nazareth as a place of substantial religiosity does, however, resonate not only with the emergence of its most famous son, Jesus, but also with the fact that, in the mid-first or second century, it was chosen as the official residence of one of the high priests of the by-then-destroyed Temple in Jerusalem, when all 24 of those Jewish religious leaders were driven into exile in Galilee.Indeed, what are probably priestly tombs have been discovered by archaeologists in and around Nazareth. Remarkably, some of them were even equipped with extremely rare life-size glass versions of the goats’ horn musical instruments – the shofarot, or shofars, that had been used during religious services in the Temple in Jerusalem and which are still blown today during the two most important religious events of the Jewish calendar.Significantly, after the fall of Jerusalem in AD70, when the Romans destroyed the Jewish Temple there, the shofar came for a period to be seen, and blown, as an expression of mourning for the Temple’s destruction.The archaeological investigation in Nazareth will help historians to better understand the ways in which Jesus’s hometown may have helped shape his religious outlook. The gospels of St Mark and St Luke suggest that his views were not popular there – and it may be that what seems to have been the ultra-strict nature of Nazareth’s religiosity had actually pushed Jesus towards a perspective that would perhaps have been more acceptable to less strictly religious Jews, such as many of those living in places like neighbouring Sepphoris.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know in some cases it’s their only main meal for the day and they’re not able to get much else.How to support our campaign“I am seeing some scared elderly people on their own, so if I speak to them from the pavement, I’m just trying to reassure them and keep their spirits up,” he adds.Briana LeBold, 47, works in fashion production and was furloughed by her company soon after the lockdown began. She has been volunteering as a food delivery cyclist a few days a week.“I decided worrying about work isn’t going to change anything,” she says. “I thought what Made in Hackney and some of the food charities were doing was wonderful, so I just wanted to get involved to support the work.“There isn’t a huge amount of interaction with people, obviously, but they do let us know how much they’re enjoying the meals. Even if it’s just a wave and a ‘hi’ – it’s still really nice to see people and feel like you’re helping in some way.”Tais Lima, a 41-year-old yoga teacher, is volunteering one day a week. “I like getting out on my bike with a sense of purpose,” she says. “There’s a lot of lonely and vulnerable people out there, but it’s rewarding to see they’re getting a meal that changes their day.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her staff identified 420 iniduals and families in the London borough in dire need of food each day, and asked for volunteers to help drop off the vegan meals between 2pm and 6pm every afternoon.Kitchen staff at the Angelina restaurant in Dalston have helped with the cooking so they can meet a target of delivering 30,000 meals over the next three months.“We knew there was going to be this incredible level of need out there, so we ripped up our job descriptions and threw ourselves into this work,” says Ms Bentley. “It’s been pretty emotional at times, pretty intense to see what people are going through. We want to be able to help more people if we possibly can.”She told The Independent how one family had no food at all in the house for more than two days before they began getting daily meals out to them.One of those receiving a delivery each afternoon is David Pavlovic, a 63-year-old with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, who was told not to leave home for a 12-week period.“I’ve got family outside of London and friends across the city – but they have problems of their own with job losses,” he says.“I did get worried for a while about having enough food, so it was just a massive relief to get meals delivered. The charities like The Felix Project and Made in Hackney are doing really important work, and it seems like they enjoy doing it too.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The initiative will be launched on Monday when the Hubb Community Kitchen plans to start cooking between 250 and 300 meals a day, three days a week.\u0026nbspThe scheme\u0026nbspfollows a Zoom conference call last week, when the duchess talked to women involved in running the kitchen about how they could adapt their service to feed people at a time when social-distancing rules prevent it from opening as normal. Much of the produce will be supplied by The Independent’s charity partner The Felix Project which sources surplus food from cafes, restaurants and supermarkets.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMeghan said: “The spirit of the Hubb Community Kitchen has always been one of caring, giving back and helping those in need, initially in Grenfell and now throughout the UK.\u0026nbspA home-cooked meal from one neighbour to another, when they need it most, is what community is all about.”How to support our campaign“I’m so proud of the women of the Hubb Community Kitchen, and the continued support The Felix Project gives them to carry out these acts of goodwill, which at this moment are urgently needed.\u0026nbspI’m equally moved by the many people who are contributing to campaign to raise money for these vital organisations in the wake of Covid-19.”The meals will be prepared in the cooks’ homes and delivered by another charity, StreetGames, which runs the Fit And Fed campaign that aims to provide nutritious meals for children at risk of going hungry during the school holidays.The Duke of Sussex, who saw the charity’s work during a visit to one of its centres in Streatham last year, put it in touch with the kitchen.Harry and Meghan on Thursday\u0026nbspcompleted two days of volunteering with Project Angel Food in California, helping to deliver food parcels to people in need.The Hubb Community Kitchen was set up in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster in June 2017, when a group of local women gathered in a communal kitchen at the Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre.The duchess first visited it in January 2018 and has continued to make regular private visits. She wrote the foreword for Together, a collection of the women’s own personal recipes from across Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mark Curtin, Felix’s chief executive, said: “The women of Hubb Community Kitchen have stepped up yet again in the face of a global pandemic.“We stand together with all of our partners to get food to people most at risk of experiencing hunger and malnutrition in this time of need.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in\u0026nbspThe Independent, said: “It is a pleasure to have the backing of the Duchess of Sussex for our campaign.\u0026nbspHer support for the survivors of the Grenfell fire is truly admirable. Our campaign will continue to support the Hubb Community Kitchen, along with so many other essential community organisations at this time.

They’re also using mobile apps tied to payments, such as Amazon Prime Now, to place delivery or pickup orders for groceries. The Treasury Department may even let people who don’t have bank accounts receive their coronavirus relief checks via mobile-payment services like Venmo.“We shouldn’t be touching anything,” said Richard Crone, chief executive officer of mobile-payment research firm Crone Consulting. He expects contactless payments to grab an additional 10 per cent to 20 per cent of transactions at stores and ATMs as the result of the pandemic. Person-to-person services like PayPal, Venmo and Zelle should benefit as well, Mr Crone said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt’s easy to see why. Even with retail stores cleaning more often than ever – if they’re open at all – handling cash or touching payment keypads stands out as a major risk. With contactless pay, you link a bank account or credit card to your phone and then tap the device on a contactless reader or hover over it to trigger payment.Already, 27 per cent of US small businesses have seen an increase in customers using services like Apple Pay, according to a survey of 361 companies released in April by the Strawhecker Group and the Electronic Transactions Association. Publix Super Markets sped up its transition to contactless terminals because of Covid-19, according to the company. Starting in early April, consumers at all Publix stores have been able to use services like Apple Pay and Google Pay to check out.“I know a lot of merchants are putting signage up at the point of sale, ‘Please use contactless’,” said Linda Kirkpatrick, a Mastercard executive who works with banks and credit unions.Burger King released a commercial in March to encourage customers to use an order-ahead app to pay at drive-thrus.A couple of weeks ago, retail giant Walmart Inc. tweaked its self-checkout system to go completely contactless when shoppers use Walmart Pay. Previously, you had to touch a “Pay now” button after scanning your groceries. Now, you can read a QR code with your phone to pay. Use of pickup and delivery at Walmart is growing as well.A million doses of coronavirus vaccine could be available by September“You are seeing customers start to use services they weren’t interested in before,” said Molly Blakeman, a Walmart spokeswoman.Many sellers at farmers’ markets have stopped accepting cash, and are instead using apps like Venmo, which is owned by PayPal Holdings Inc. The app got it started as a way for friends to reimburse each other for dinner or for roommates to handle rent.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some are buying items in bulk for the whole neighbourhood and then using Zelle to collect payments. Others are sending cash gifts to relatives for their birthdays.“People don’t want to handle cash, especially at this time, so they are looking to mobile payments as the b,est alternatives,” Ms Fintland said.That said, the coronavirus shutdown has hurt some types of mobile payment services and forced others to adjust.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastToast Inc., which makes management systems for restaurants, laid off half its staff in April. Earlier this week, Grubhub pulled its 2020 guidance, largely because of the acute situation in New York, where many restaurants have closed. Companies that serve ride-sharing companies, like Stripe and Adyen, may also suffer as usage declines.The industry’s established players are also facing new competition. In March, portable-reader heavyweight Square Inc. rolled out ways for its restaurant owners to offer pickup and delivery options.“We’ve seen so many folks pivoting to online to keep their businesses going,” said Katie Dally, a Square spokeswoman. Independent booksellers and other businesses are offering pickup and delivery too, she said.As more people embrace contactless technology and get used to paying that way, consumer behaviour is going to change for good, experts say.The rush delivery service at supermarket chain Safeway hit 670,000 weekly active US mobile users the week of 29 March, up from fewer than 50,000 in the week of 1 March, according to the analytics platform App Annie. Amazon Prime Now’s Android and iPhone active user base grew 60 per cent, according to App Annie.“It’s behaviour that’s going to stick after stay at home ends,” said Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 Research. “There will be muscle memory about paying, and consumers will use it going around their daily life.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is the country hardest hit by coronavirus in the Middle East, with at least 5,118 people reportedly killed by Covid-19 and at least 82,000 confirmed infections that have led to quarantine measures and a shuttering of public and commercial life like those in the west. Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastBut the shutdown of business activity has damaged an economy already in deep recession because of low oil prices, harsh United States sanctions, and persistent incompetence and corruption.\u0026nbsp“Social distancing in poor\u0026nbspcountries can cause death due to starvation, too,” said\u0026nbspNassim\u0026nbspAssefi, a global health physician who has worked in Iran.Iran finds itself facing the same pressures as leaders in much of the world, attempting to balance a growing clamour from the public to resume economic life with recommendations of health and public officials warning that while the peak of the pandemic had been reached, a resurgence of the virus is likely if social distancing measures were eased too soon. \u0026nbsp“We are concerned about another outbreak in Tehran,” Mohsen Hashemi Rafsanjani, chairman of the capital’s municipal council, was quoted as saying.Health experts have pointed to the resurgence of infections in Asian cities that may have lifted restrictions too early. “I think it’s premature,” said Arin Balalian, an epidemiologist of Iranian descent at Columbia University. “It\u0026nbspcarries a substantial risk for the disease to come back. You are going to have shoppers and labourers, and all of them are going to use public transport, which increases the risk of transmission.”Some researchers caution that Iran’s actual numbers of dead and infected may be far higher than those promulgated by a government with a long track record of opacity and distortion.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Physicians inside the country have also noted an improvement in conditions at Iranian hospitals in recent weeks as authorities imposed stringent lockdown measures.\u0026nbspIran’s economy is in shambles. It shrank an estimated 8.7 per cent last year, with the official unemployment rate expected to rise to 13.5 per cent this year. Thanks to US\u0026nbsppressure, Iran has reportedly been denied a $5bn\u0026nbsp(£4bn) loan from the International Monetary Fund that it had requested, adding to pressure on Iranian authorities.\u0026nbspIran began allowing what it described as low-risk businesses such as offices to reopen last weekend throughout the country and on Saturday in the capital Tehran, leading to massive traffic jams, large crowds in metro stations, and queues to apply for $238 (£190) loans offered by the government.On Friday an Army Day parade was held, with officers maintaining social distancing measures as they marched in formation at a base in Tehran while displaying disinfectant trucks used to clean streets of potential coronavirus instead of tanks and jeeps.\u0026nbspDespite the partial reopening, the number of cases and deaths did not spike, according to officials. “Our assessment is that people cooperated with us and businessmen, too, observed the protocols, one of the signs of which is that we have not had an increase in the number of citizens infected,” Mr Rouhani said.But Iranian and international health officials have warned that it could take up two weeks for a surge in cases to be detected, with many coronavirus carriers either asymptomatic or suffering from relatively mild symptoms while continuing to spread the airborne pathogen. “To get from\u0026nbspexposure to\u0026nbspsymptoms takes four or five days,” said Ms Assefi. “You’re not going\u0026nbspto see death rates or even severe infections for up to weeks after easing distancing.”Nonetheless, Mr Rouhani was upbeat,\u0026nbspurging\u0026nbspbusiness leaders to launch construction and development projects to increase employment and restart the economy.Many coronavirus containment measures will remain in place. Schools will remain closed, with distance-learning in place classes have been extended for an additional four to six weeks into the summer.\u0026nbspMr Rouhani announced that all shops must close by 6pm and warned that the opening of businesses at malls, bazaars and shopping areas did not include gyms or restaurants, which he described as high risk.“If there is a shopping mall with a high-risk business, for example, a restaurant or a teahouse, but people gather there, those high-risk businesses will be closed again,” he said.\u0026nbsp“They can do takeaway. But people cannot sit in restaurants and have food.”\u0026nbspMr Rouhani said professional conferences, training workshops or academic seminars would continue to be banned, along with any kind of public gatherings whether for “happy or sad” occasions.\u0026nbsp“This is a gradual move,” he said. “Any step we take the health practitioners will scrutinise them constantly. If they see a problem arising we will for sure reverse our decision.”To contain the potential spread of coronavirus at prisons, Iran has also extended for at least a month a leave it has granted tens of thousands of detainees, including the British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.The partial reopening of the country to commerce comes ahead of the beginning of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, a time of frequent religious gatherings, and festive iftar meals marking the end of daily dusk-to-dawn fasts. But Mr Rouhani announced a continued ban on religious gatherings, including group iftars, for at least the next two weeks.“During Ramadan people go to the mosques more than usual,” he said. “We urge people to hold inidual prayers rather than group ones. God will listen to people.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Half of those , deaths are blamed on coronavirus.We do not know how the other half died, although some will have missed le-saving healthcare because of the ­pandemic.What we do know is that this hideous virus is killing the economy.The Office for Budget Responsibilitywarns a three-month shutdown will slash growth by more than a third, push unemployment up by two million and raise borrowing by an eye-watering  per cent.Lockdown has destroyed Britain’s “jobs miracle”, put paid to a fragile “Brexit bounce” and triggered what could be the worst depression in living memory.“It is important people know there will be hardship ahead,” warned Chancellor Rishi Sunak, an under- statementever there was one.On your one-hour daily exercise break, you can see the tragedy unfolding.Once-thriving restaurants and bars, busy offices and shops and key construction sites are locked and bolted.Behind every door is a personal and economic tragedy.Despite a torrent of taxpayers’ cash unleashed by Mr Sunak, many will never reopen. Some are already bust. Le will never be quite the same again.The Treasury is stumping up billions to pay furloughed full-time workers, help the self-employed and offer Universal Credit to the very large number who slip between the cracks.We are piling shedloads on to our already massive national debt. For many firms and iniduals this is a devastating blow from which they may never recover, financially or mentally.Lives lost from delayed emergency care, alcoholism, drugs and domestic abuse have rocketed.Together with fatalities from other causes — mostly poverty and despair — they could dwarf the toll from the virus.Some children’s le chances will be wrecked by a long break from school or, worse, from being cooped up with violent family members.Those who keep their jobs may be forced into severe pay cuts. Costs will spill down through the generations.Not everyone is suffering.Public sector jobs and pensions are secure, for the time being.Some with savings, decent homes and jobs they can do from home might actually be enjoying Easter with their families at their side.Breadwinners forced to stay in instead of eating out or flying abroad will have spare cash in their pockets at the end of the month. And some will have grabbed Rishi Sunak’s offer of  per cent pay to put their feet up at the taxpayers’ expense.But it all adds up to a crimson bottom line that our children and grandchildren will have to meet over decades to come. Some of it will be paid for in blood.Without cash from tax revenues, how do we meet Sunak’s pledge to fund — “whatever it takes” — our wonderful NHS and its costly new le-saving treatments The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealCan we afford a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state, good schools or the promised infrastructure linking North and South with better roads and railways One day a vaccine will bring this miserable pandemic to an end.

A terrying collapse in tax revenues. A vast Government bailout to save businesses and jobs.It should be a comfort that these same official forecasts also predict a rapid rebound, assuming the lockdown ends and the virus is largely conquered.But eventhat startling optimism — which we struggle to share — is borne out, immense and permanent damage will already have been done. Millions of jobs will have been destroyed, thriving firms bankrupted and a monstrous new debt pile amassed, taking years to pay off. The pain of the austerity era after  will have been a mere taster.It is good at least that Britain now knows this. We hope it sinks in. The public must consider it before it rails against any relaxing of the lockdown in case more Covid victims die.No one wants more lives lost. But the debate is not lives versus money and jobs. Many will also die from the hardships of poverty, unemployment, tax rises and spending cutsthe economy is kept paralysed much longer.The behavioural scientists advising the Government rightly fear that the public will doubt whether the lockdown’s success in protecting the NHS is still worth itthe recession it triggers kills thousands and destroys the health ­service’s funding anyway.We are not there yet. We do not yet knowUK deaths have peaked, though hospital admissions are flattening and the NHS does now look likely to cope.But the crunch point, where a date is set to slowly release Britain from house arrest, cannot wait much longer.Labour will blame the Tories, but all of these pandemic risks were pointed out as far back as  when Labour were in power.Boris, who became Prime Minister only nine months ago, was occupied with other matters until his December landslide.There are some “green shoots”, to quote one of our medical experts.The NHS now has spare capacity. There is no longer a risk of it being overwhelmed.This was one of the key reasons for the draconian crackdown — to avoid an unmanageable “spike” in crisis admissions.That risk has diminished.

apprenticeship.And while  per cent feel attending university is an essential part of getting their dream job,  per cent believe le skills - rather than academics - are more crucial.The study, by free careers education service SPRINGPOD, also found that of those who attended university, one in six said their course did not correlate to the career they wish to pursue.A third even said they would now reconsider their choice of degree.When it comes to preferred careers, Britain is set for a boom in scientists – after that came out as the top choice for young jobseekers.Treading the boards as an actor came second, followed by teaching, in third.Despite the ‘Love Island’ effect, just four per cent of -to- year-olds consider ‘social media influencer’ as the profession for them.However, their career choice inspiration comes through social media - with a third saying it’s their core source of job inspiration.This beats parents’ influence, with just one in four saying they get career inspiration from their mum and dad.In order to help navigate this tricky le-stage, SPRINGPOD has launched Learn Lounge, an online community showcasing a wide-range of career paths from some of the leading lights in each industry, to help the next generation of workers find the right career path for them.The free initiative has lined-up online talks from a erse pool of careers, including ex-England cricket legend Monty Panesar, polar explorer Ann Daniels and the Guinness World Record-holding inventor Richard Browning.Oliver Fisher, co-founder of SPRINGPOD said: “There’s a dizzying array of routes into the perfect job, but navigating this can be an arduous task.“We want to redefine career advice to help -to- year-olds find the right way to the right career.“It’s incredible to see the influence on STEM education, leading to scientist being named the number one profession for the next generation.“And despite the boomer generation being concerned that everyone under  wants to be a social media star, just four per cent said they would consider this a career.”The study also found one in four of the - year-olds polled felt pressured to follow in the family footsteps and carry on in the same career as their parents.And despite some youngsters being steadfast in their career aspirations, many found contacts, geography, and debt among the barriers to getting them the job.A fth also said they feel like a lack of real-le connections in their chosen industry will hinder their chances, while one in six said living in the ‘wrong’ place could scupper them.The same number also felt like there were not enough opportunities to get into the business.But just two per cent see social class as a potential barrier.The study, carried out via OnePoll also revealed a money-savvy one in  is concerned about accruing student debt in order to get the job they want.And when it comes to earnings, one in five expects a starting salary of £,, while an ambitious one per cent hope to earn at least £,.The former Secretary of State for Education and Science, and patron of SPRINGPOD, Lord Baker said: I have seen first-hand the impact that employers and influential role models can have on young peoples career trajectories by engaging with them at an early age.“Inspirational career stories are hugely beneficial in helping them understand real-world challenges and how to overcome them to attain success.“Showcasing dferent career paths also help young people understand the wide choice of roles available out there.”For more information on the free lessons and a full line-up of speakers

The move has led to accusations that Chancellor Rishi Sunak ’s appointment of ex-boss Richard Sharp could cause a potential “conflict of interest”.The former City banker is chairman at Roundshield, a firm that makes money helping struggling firms get access to cash. One financial expert told us: “The appointment will give him a privileged insight into the market where his business operates – as well as knowledge of government thinking competitors would love. “I believe it is a conflict of interest.” Ex-shadow chancellor John McDonnell is among MPs infuriated by the move. He said: “It is an extraordinary ministerial decision and needs explaining how on earth it cannot represent a serious conflict of interest.” Multi-millionaire Mr Sharp, , has donated £, to the Tory Party in the past. He is on the board of right wing think tank the Centre for Policy Studies. He also owns % in a drugs company linked to the testing of potential coronavirus vaccines. He was Mr Sunak’s boss and mentor when the Chancellor worked as a banker at Goldman Sachs. His new unpaid role will involve sorting out the chaotic Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans Schemewhich has so far dished out cash to just , firms forced to furlough staff or stop trading, despite , inquiries.It’s not the first time Mr Sharp – once an advisor to Boris Johnson as London mayor – has been caught up in controversy. In , he was appointed to the Bank of England’s powerful Financial Policy Committee– and then joined Roundshield, fuelling questions over a conflict of interest. He also attended a Tory fundraising party weeks after assuring parliament he would not let past political connections compromise his independence.

Jenny Harries defended the governmentaposs approach, saying the plan was very clear. So far, , people have died in hospital from the disease, with many more thought to have died at home or in care homes. Boris Johnson has faced mounting pressure over the early days of the outbreak.He did not attend the first five Cobra meetings on Covid-, and his government has been accused of responding to the pandemic too slowly.Asked about the Prime Minister missing Cobra meetings, Mr Williamson said: The Prime Minister from the moment that it became clear that there were challenges in terms of coronavirus developing in China has absolutely been leading our nationaposs effort to combat the coronavirus, making sure that resources or money is not a concern for any department, especially the health service.He added that many Cobra meetings are led by the departmental minister. He said: The focus the Prime Minister was putting on this and has continued to put on this has meant that this is the whole Government effort. Speaking at the daily Covid- briefing, Dr Harries said: We had and we still have a very clear plan - we had a containment phase and it was very successful. We had very strict quarantine regimes from high-risk areas, we followed up inidual cases and families wherever that was possible. But once you end up with seeding and cases across the community, our focus has to be on managing the clinical conditions of those iniduals. And she cautioned against comparing UK figures with Germany, adding: We are at dferent phases of the pandemic.  Dr Harries declined to say whether the UK had passed the peak of the virus. She said: I would be very tempted to offer a comment on that today but Iaposm not going to be, for a number of reasons. She identied that the low number of deaths recorded today was positive but cautioned against reading too much into the figures, which are often retrospectively revised. She said: We could jump to all sorts of positive conclusions about that, but we shouldnapost. I do think it is fair to say that we do know from the hospital data that we are starting to plateau across. But she added: If we donapost keep doing the social distancing, we will create a second peak and we definitely wonapost be past it, so this is no reason to consider that we have managed this.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailBright canvases fill the walls, paint pots and crayons scatter the tables and a cat called Pablo Picasso is curled up sleeping in a corner. Louise Allen’s colourful, bohemian home is an homage to all things artistic. The -year-old is an illustrator, artist and author, her husband Lloyd, , is a graphic designer, and their two sons aged  and  are named Jacksonand Vincent . Surprisingly, however, Louise’s passion for beautul things came about because of her exposure to ugly abuse as a child. And now, as a foster parent, she uses the healing power of art to benefit the vulnerable children in her care. ‘Art was the one thing that saved me throughout a very dficult childhood,’ explains Louise, who lives in Somerset. ‘When I had no words to express myself, I found real comfort in drawing and creating things. Often shame and trauma are hard to vocalise. But pictures can be a powerful way to help children communicate.’ Louise – whose real mum was an unmarried teenager – was adopted in  and grew up in Oxford. But her adoptive mother was cruel. Louise was starved, forced to scavenge for food and eat dirt, punished with ice baths, and frequently hit. The only respite in her otherwise miserable childhood and adolescence was art. ‘At school we were asked to make a family tree for a project,’ recalls Louise. ‘Well, I knew I was adopted and mine would not be the neat chart on a piece of A paper that my peers would produce. So instead I painted a huge ft tree with branches and leaves for the teacher. Amazingly, I was told my efforts had earned me a trip to the Tate in London. ‘Being in that gallery, seeing all these beautul pictures, was an eye-opening, le-changing experience. Standing next to them gave me a sense of value. They were important and admired, and being in that environment made me have more self worth by proximity.’ After that, Louise – who suffers from dyslexia and dyscalculia, and constantly felt ‘thick’ – began bunking off school. Not to hang out at McDonald’s like other kids her age, but to educate herself about art with trips at her local Ashmolean Museum.  Eventually, at , unable to cope with her cruel adoptive mother’s bullying, Louise ran away to the coast with a boyfriend. She worked as a waitress and barmaid saving every penny until she won a place at Portsmouth School of Art. ‘Le changed completely from then,’ smiles Louise, who ended up teaching and lecturing at the art school for more than  years. It was also where she met her future husband, Lloyd. As students in the s they were just mates, but re-met and fell in love in  and married three years later. It was seven years ago, in , when the family decided to start fostering children. ‘It was time to give something back to society. I knew I could relate to vulnerable children after my own experience of trauma, neglect and abuse.’ Louise, who is currently fostering two girls of  and nine, has now looked after  children in total, some of whom have stayed with her for five years and are very much part of the family. Louise’s calm, caring presence and natural warmth help youngsters feel comfortable coming into the family home. ‘I give all the children who come here a proper sketchbook and pens and pencils. Often they can communicate much better with pictures and images. Children who have suffered abuse will say whatever they think an adult wants to hear, that’s a survival instinct. ‘It’s what I used to do. But they can draw things that they may not have the words for, the images they produce can be so insightful.’  One of the first girls Louise cared for, Stella, was helped to communicate through art. ‘Stella came to me aged five, a tiny bird-like little thing. Her wild, teenage mum Shannon had named her after a can of lager. Her dad was a low-level drug dealer. She bounced between them all and then, with the misguided support of a social worker, Stella ended up back in Shannon’s care.’ Stella’s school teacher noticed she behaved inappropriately when getting undressed for PE, and had bruises. They alerted the authorities and the little girl was found abandoned in a deserted house with no food, water, clothes or warmth. With the security and love of Louise’s family, Stella made good progress. One of the first times the foster mum encouraged Stella to express herself with crayons and paper, her simple drawings were heartbreaking. ‘I could quite easily tell there was her mum, and then there was a group of men with spiky hair and sharp teeth,’ describes Louise. ‘Stella had drawn them all with these big penises. ‘Shannon had pimped out her daughter for drug money. I crouched down next to her and said, “Thank you for showing me”. Stella didn’t have the language at that time but she wanted to share that information with me.’  But there were more shocking insights of Stella’s abuse to come. ‘One day I lined up the kids in the garden to have their picture taken, I said, “Say cheese!” and Stella’s immediate response was to throw herself to the floor, take her knickers off and open her legs.’ Sickeningly, poor Stella had been frequently coerced into performing sex acts for the camera. ‘It shocked me to the core, I felt like screaming inside,’ admits Louise. ‘But when things like this happen, you have to stay calm, put the child’s feelings first, don’t make a big deal. Then try to make sure they don’t do it again. aposI generally put Stella in trousers after that, and when I took her to the beach I dressed her in a one-piece to eliminate her taking her pants off, which she had been taught to do. You have to be pragmatic as a carer.’ Another time, Stella had a violent reaction to a Lion bar Louise had provided for a garden picnic. Unbeknown to the foster mum, it was the same brand of chocolate the little girl had always been awarded by Shannon as a ‘treat’ after she had been subjected to vile sexual abuse. ‘She began shaking and ran off and hid behind the shrubs,’ says Louise. ‘Sadly child abuse victims commonly get treated with sweets.’ Another time, Stella was happily playing when – asshe had been taken over by an alien – she began screaming a stream of graphic sexual swear words, replaying some of the terrible things that had happened to her. ‘I gently shooed the other children away so they couldn’t hear and then I stayed with Stella, made her feel safe and loved while she calmed down.’ Stella’s tragic abuse and exploitation could not simply be solved by colouring or crayons, of course. Louise explains that a wonderfully sympathetic policewoman, and other healthcare professionals all became involved.  But there is no doubt the hours spent quietly painting and drawing in Louise’s calm, non-judgemental company, organically opened up conversations. And became an important part of the healing process. Happily, Stella’s story ends well. Aged six, she was adopted by Danny, who was already a loving dad to three other adopted children. ‘When a single middle-aged man said he would adopt Stella I was full of suspicion and concern,’ admits Louise. ‘But Danny is delightful, he set up an engineering company when he was much younger and made a lot of money, and wanted to do something worthwhile with his le.

Alongside runners and cyclists enjoying their daily form of exercise, some people have been spotted sunbathing on the grass or by the sea. Some groups of people were seen lying down in Kensington Palace Gardens in London today, despite Health Secretary Matt Hancock saying that sunbathing is against the rules.  Other people were seen sitting down on the pebble beach at Hove while enjoying the nice weather as UK temperatures hit C.It comes after the Government has repeatedly asked people to stay home even when the weather is nice - going out only when necessary, such as for grocery shopping, any medical need, one form of exercise a day or go to workit cannot be done from  home. The National Police Chiefsapos Council and the College of Policing has recently issued a new guidance meant to clary the rules around the lockdown.Officers are advised not to intervenepeople stop to rest or eat lunch while on a long walk, but short walks to sit on a park bench are not allowed. The guidance says: A very short period of aposexerciseapos to excuse a long period of inactivity may mean that the person is not engaged in aposexerciseapos but in fact something .  The document also claries that anyone can travel to workit is not reasonably possible to work from home. However, it says it is not allowed for home-workers to choose to work in a park.The lockdown in the UK - has to be reviewed by law every three weeks - is currently in place until May .Government sources admit that ministers are debating how to balance tackling the  coronavirus  against the economic effect of the lockdown. One government source  told the Mirror  : “We’re clearly concerned about the economic impact of all of this but public health is the absolute priority right now.“It would be wrong to look like bean counters at the expense of saving lives.” "},{"url":null,"title":"children to sent back school","story":"NewsSchools will reopen in three weeks under new three-stage lockdown exit planIt has been claimed that primary schools will resume lessons first and students from Years  and  who are due to sit their GCSEs and A-levels next year will alsoto the classroomShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video government-announce-vaccine-task-force-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news children-to-sent-back-school-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

With less footfall across cities and towns there is less associated food waste being left in bins and on the floor. As a result, rat populations are likely to move further afield to satisfy their need for a food source and this, in turn, is likely to cause more sightings. By nature, rats will also try to avoid humans directly and so, with less of us walking the streets, they may be getting a little bolder and possibly be seen in areas they normally wouldn’t. In terms of rats in domestic homes, so long as you manage your food waste properly and there are no considerable harbourage opportunities, you shouldn’t experience any unusual problems. The risk may be thatyou find you are doing more gardening and creating more garden waste, the storage of this in piles around your garden can provide a perfect place for rats to live and breed. Pest experts working in homes around the country say they have experienced similar issues. Peter Higgs, managing director of PGH Pest Control  Prevention, based in Cranleigh, Surrey, said his firm has seen a  per cent increase in residential call-outs since social distancing measures were introduced.  He said: They are coming into homes - thataposs exactly whataposs happening. All of the waste that was produced by people eating food out, and from establishments doing the cooking - thataposs gone. I think some bin collections arenapost quite as frequent at the moment too. They are getting into rubbish. When they are hungry they will eat each other. They will use a hierarchy in cities - the big rats will eat the smaller ones. They will come in using the drainage system - they eat faeces. They transmit diseases. A professional should be called to deal with the problem. We donapost want people trying to sort it out themselves and using their own poison and contracting something - they need to stay away. Itaposs really important they get an expert in. When the lockdown was first announced some people took to stockpiling food, fearing supermarkets would run out. But a leading body recently warned of the dangers of doing so - fearing it could further encourage rats into residential properties. The National Pest Technicians Association said rodents could get in without people knowing and cause problems. Technical manager John Hope said: It’s the same as when rubbish piles up on the street due to missed bin collections.

Up to  people have ­volunteered for the project, which is led by Oxford University and will test four drugs. They include the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, an anti-inflammatory drug, a steroid and an anti-retroviral drug that is normally used to treat HIV. The Recovery trial, which takes in  UK hospitals, will kick off within days and is due to wrap up in August. Similar trials under way in the US and Europe have a few hundred ­patients in total. Key Government adviser Sir John Bell, who is part of our vaccine taskforce, said: “If we can see ­evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or the end of May, then I think the game is on. “Then, of course, there is the massive issue of how you manufacture at scale many billions of doses.” Professor Peter Horby, another vaccine expert, added: “The UK is leading the global fight against the pandemic.“We’ve set up this trial in ­record time. It’s the biggest trial in the world and realistically by June or July we will get a very clear signal on whether the drugs are effective.” Drug companies and universities across the globe are racing to develop a Covid- vaccine.

As many prepare to leave education and enter the world of work, research found  per cent are nervous about picking the right career path. But % of the   to -year-olds polled have never considered taking part in an apprenticeship. And while % feel attending university is an essential part of getting their dream job, % believe le skills - rather than academics - are more crucial. The study, by free careers education service SPRINGPOD, also found that of those who attended university, one in six said their course did not correlate to the career they wish to pursue. A third even said they would now reconsider their choice of degree. When it comes to preferred careers, Britain is set for a boom in scientists - after that came out as the top choice for young jobseekers. Treading the boards as an actor came second, followed by teaching, in third.Despite the apos Love Island apos effect, just four per cent of -to- year-olds consider apossocial media influencerapos as the profession for them.However, their career choice inspiration comes through social media - with a third saying itaposs their core source of job inspiration. This beats parentsapos influence, with just one in four saying they get career inspiration from their mum and dad. In order to help navigate this tricky le-stage, SPRINGPOD has launched Learn Lounge, an online community showcasing a wide-range of career paths from some of the leading lights in each industry, to help the next generation of workers find the right career path for them. The free initiative has lined-up online talks from a erse pool of careers, including ex-England cricket legend Monty Panesar, polar explorer Ann Daniels and the Guinness World Record-holding inventor Richard Browning.  Oliver Fisher, co-founder of SPRINGPOD said: Thereaposs a dizzying array of routes into the perfect job, but navigating this can be an arduous task. We want to redefine career advice to help -to- year-olds find the right way to the right career. Itaposs incredible to see the influence on STEM education, leading to scientist being named the number one profession for the next generation. And despite the boomer generation being concerned that everyone under  wants to be a social media star, just four per cent said they would consider this a career. The study also found one in four of the - year-olds polled felt pressured to follow in the family footsteps and carry on in the same career as their parents. And despite some youngsters being steadfast in their career aspirations, many found contacts, geography, and debt among the barriers to getting them the job.  A fth also said they feel like a lack of real-le connections in their chosen industry will hinder their chances, while one in six said living in the aposwrongapos place could scupper them. The same number also felt like there were not enough opportunities to get into the business. But just two per cent see social class as a potential barrier.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAcross the country, children have been stuck in their family homes for weeks. Away from friends and school, this new way of le is taking its toll on their mental health. A survey commissioned by children’s charity World Vision has shown one in three British children aged five to   have told parents they are lonely since schools shut. And unsurprisingly almost a third of parents have noticed negative changes in children’s behaviour since lockdown – including tantrums, meltdowns, nightmares, tummy ache, fighting and crying. Daniela Buzducea, from World Vision, says the global pandemic is having a serious impact, leaving some children frightened, insecure and isolated. So how can parents look after their youngsters’ mental health in these stay-at-home days  Daniela says: “Parents can give children emotional support, reduce stress levels, and help them feel safe. It’s important to find out what children have heard about the pandemic and listen to their concerns. Parents should talk calmly and explain in a way appropriate to their child’s level of understanding. “It may be easier for young children to draw a picture rather than talk about something scary. Offer them crayons and paper.” Here are more ways to support your children through the lockdown.  Explain it Child psychologist Dr Alicia Drummond, author of Teen Tips, runs a podcast aimed at helping parents cope in isolation. She suggests finding a quiet moment to talk honestly with your children, whatever their age. “Recognise this is a challenging time. Tell them it is a serious situation, but it won’t last forever,” she says. Young children may not understand why birthday parties and family outings have been cancelled. Or they might worry about parents or grandparents catching the virus. Discuss with your children how your family is doing everything it can to minimise the risks such as washing their hands and social distancing. Encourage them to keep in touch with grandparents and other family members online. Make sure you don’t have the news on all the time. Constant updates can feel overwhelming and even the youngest kids pick up on the anxiety of adults.  Discover their worries Dr Peter Fuggle, clinical psychologist at the child mental health research Anna Freud Centre, says for children aged three to seven, playing together may be the best way to find out what is worrying your child. Often the games children play are based on what they are thinking. There are a host of programmes and initiatives to help young kids understand the current situation. Sesame Street has launched a new website Caring For Each Other , while Sky Kids has introduced virtual playdates. Dr Emma Maynard, psychologist and senior lecturer in education at University of Portsmouth, says younger children, mainly those under seven, need plenty of reassurance. “If you are self-isolating and cannot hug them, let them hold their favourite teddies and toys for as long as they want.” Maynard also suggests putting hug tokens in a jar for cashing in after isolation. This also works for teenagers who have missed out on some key celebrations. By postponing them until autumn or even next year, it reminds them we will not be in lockdown forever.  Stick to routines Structure is important for kids of all ages as is regular exercise. “Routine is very reassuring for children. Stick to regular mealtimes and bedtimes. It’s important to eat well and sleep well, and routine also helps the day pass more quickly,” says Dr Maynard. “Family playtime is also important in isolation and children learn every time they play.” While some families have embraced home schooling with fixed timetables of lessons, don’t worryit doesn’t work for your family. “It might be better to have a more gentle, sustainable work and play routine that can be maintained over time,” says Dr Maynard. Stay creative Now that we are spending more time together we need to keep our routine creative. For older children showing heightened anxiety, try Headspace for Kids . Its series of guided meditations are designed to help calm children down and focus their minds.For seven to -year-olds, there are numerous online resources reached through a simple google search. Bear Grylls has teamed up with the Scouts organisation to launch the Great Indoors to provide fun inside activities. Strictly’s Oti Mabuse is running dance classes and David Walliams is reading his children’s books online. For more ideas try artfulparent for craft activities, littlecooks for baking courses and cosmickids for online yoga. Teenagers can join Club Quarantine’s DJ D-Nice on Friday nights, -pm on Instagram live, as an alternative to going out. Space to chill If you are getting cabin fever staying at home, Dr Alicia Drummond’s suggests making a quiet corner where kids can take time out. If your children are squabbling and driving you to distraction, take yourself off to the quiet area instead. If you can, create a separate space in your home for learning and relaxation. Butthat’s not possible, then make sure you pack away school work once the day is done. Stay connected The most important part of staying healthy during this period of isolation is staying in touch. “Staying connected is important for safeguarding our children’s mental health through the lockdown,” says Dr Maynard.“Encourage your children to chat with friends using Google Hangouts or Zoom.”But while social media plays a part in helping our children stay sociable, it is also a good idea to have a time and place to connect that is offline. Go for a walk near your house or build a denyou have access to a garden. Woodlandtrust.org.uk has produced a list of nature activities children can do at home and the Happy Little Farmer App has great ideas to encourage children to get into gardening.

It happened on no ordinary day. And the sheer wanton destruction and vile state the house was left in convinced Caley it was by no means a random raid. Through sheer dogged detective work over two long and stressful years she would finally prove that her former best pal Katie Morrison, , was behind it. Caley even uncovered a long history of deception in which she had been conned out of thousands of pounds. Her nightmare began on the day she had organised a fundraiser in memory of beloved brother Tom, who was only  when he died in a moped crash. Jobless Katie, her brother Christopher and boyfriend David Rodericks struck while Caley was out. The entire house – even her two kids’ stuff – was a mess. Clothes were cut up, wardrobes and drawers were ransacked, the bathroom was trashed and walls were smeared with gunk. Food, cigarette butts and beer bottles littered the floor. The intruders set fire to a bedroom, used the home as a toilet and left other insulting evidence of their raid. Building surveyor Caley, , was heartbroken... and furious. Police had no valid forensic evidence because Katie used to live with Caley and Rodericks knew his victim too – explaining their DNA at the scene. But Caley was suspicious after they gave flimsy and conflicting reasons for not being at the fundraiser. She quizzed neighbours and uncovered a paper trail that finally led to all three being convicted. Last night mum-of-two Caley said: “I built the case against them myself and I was determined they wouldn’t win. Now they know, when they targeted me, they were messing with the wrong woman!” Caley had spent months organising the fundraising event at Capel Manor College in Enfield, North London. She explained: “It was an amazing event to raise money for Tom’s college where he had learned gardening. “We had a funfair, pony rides, a barbecue, performances and even a Bob Marley tribute act. The sun was shining and the crowds were loving it. But at pm I got a text from my neighbour, saying my window blinds were fully down.  “I asked him to look through my window. He said the TV was missing and my house had been ransacked. I felt sick. “I had to carry on the rest of the day knowing my house was wrecked.” When Caley got home to Charlwood Village, Surrey, she was horried. She was mystied too... then realised Katie and Rodericks, , had failed to turn up at the fundraiser. “Something told me it was Katie,” said Caley. “We’d been pals for  years and once shared the house, but our friendship had fallen apart when David came on the scene. He was jealous of our relationship and Katie eventually moved out.” Katie texted Caley saying she missed the memorial event because she was in hospital. But brother Christopher, , had said Katie had gone to Yorkshire. The raiders’ story had unravelled at the first hurdle – and Caley was on to them. Without revealing her suspicions, Caley quizzed neighbours and learned the trio had been at her house that day. One local called police after spotting them arguing outside. Forensics were called in and the three were arrested. “I thought bingo, I’ve got them,” said Caley. “I was gutted a friend could have done such a horrible thing but at least I would get justice.” But police dropped the case after Katie claimed to have a key to the property – explaining the DNA find. Caley went on: “I was livid. I was not about to take this lying down. I hadn’t let on to Katie I knew she had been arrested and she was texting me as normal. “It was a really dficult time. I wonderedthe  years we shared as friends had ever meant anything to her.” But things were to get worse. Weeks later Rodericks filed a civil claim against Caley for money he said she owed him.  Caley said: “I was furious. David had given Katie and I a loan as a rent deposit for the house but I paid it back. I knew he was behind my house being ransacked so I was determined not to pay a penny.” As part of Rodericks’ claim, he supplied credit card statements which were sent on to Caley. She spent hours going through them and realised many household items she and Katie had bought were paid for on Rodericks’ credit card. Caley revealed: “I started to notice discrepancies. Katie and I had bought the TV which she said cost £,, but on the statements it was clearly £,. “I delved deeper and deeper and was shocked. There were so many items she said we’d gone halves on that were cheaper than she claimed. “That’s the catalyst moment when I snapped. I was not having this – no way!” Caley, now of Enfield, filed a counterclaim alleging Katie and Rodericks had conned her out of £,. She won a civil court case and the pair were to told to repay £, between them. Caley continued: “It was great and something to celebrate but they had still got away with wrecking my home.”  After sending police a bundle of evidence – backed up by witnesses who had seen the trio that day – the case was reopened. Caley said: “Every time I found new evidence or someone who could strengthen the criminal case I’d call the police. They must have been fed up of me but I was determined to get justice. Police tracked their phone movements to the area of my house that day. “If I hadn’t kept pushing I don’t think that would have happened.” "},{"url":null,"title":"live updates uk coronavirus pandemic","story":"\"liveBlogUpdate\": ,\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news live-updates-uk-coronavirus-pandemic-\",],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news live-updates-uk-coronavirus-pandemic-\",\",\"author\":,\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news live-updates-uk-coronavirus-pandemic-\",],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news live-updates-uk-coronavirus-pandemic-\", said.

Turn your gaze skyward out your windows or grab a blanket and set up the deckchairs outdoors at your home to take in the spectacular lightshow. Anywhere from ten to hundreds of meteors an hour are predicted to glitter across the Northern Hemisphereaposs night skies this week. The annual meteor shower is expected to peak on Tuesday night and the best viewing time is just before dawn on Wednesday. Hereaposs some tips on taking in the dazzling phenomenon safely during the national coronavirus lockdown. What is the Lyrid Meteor Shower and when can you see it  The spectacular light shower is already underway but will be most visible in the United Kingdom and the United States early this week. Experts say the peak viewing time will be late Tuesday night and into the early hours of Wednesday, with observations are affected by the phases of the moon and local weather conditions. The Lyrid Meteor Shower occurs every April - putting on a spectacular light-show for stargazers. Shooting stars appear as dust from the Comet C  G Thatcher and interact with the Earth’s atmosphere. When this dust enters Earth’s atmosphere, it burns up, producing a trail of light through the sky. It takes its name from the Lyra constellation, from which the meteors appear to radiate. While it is due to start tonight, the peak of the Lyrid meteor shower will be overnight on April -, NASA meteor expert Bill Cooke told Space. The Lyrids will be visible beginning at about :pm, but are best viewed in the darkness after midnight and when urban lights have been switched off as households turn in for bed. The best time to watch is after midnight and before the light of dawn, the expert said. Check the weather forecast in your area to determine the prime time overnight to skygaze. The phenomenonaposs peak visibility time of Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning is due to the phase of the moon. It will be a thin crescent only about two days from the new moon at that time, Mr Cooke said, so the moonlight wonapost drown out the light-show. Visibility will depend on how clear and dark the night sky where you live is, Cooke said.  The expert said the average Lyrid shower produces  to  meteors per hour, and this year about  per hour are predicted - although sometimes hundreds an hour can be seen tearing across the skies. Some years, the Lyrid meteor shower can produce up to  meteors per hour in whataposs called an outburst, but it is hard to predict, Mr Cooke added. There is an average of  years between the outbursts, but the actual number of years between them ies, he said. How best to view the meteor shower during the UK lockdown The spectacular could not have come at a better time for the UK in lockdown. As we stay home to protect the NHS and stop spreading the coronavirus, those of us who are not key workers on shts should be in the perfect spot to catch the light-show. Normally, eager stargazers are urged to head to the countryside where there is less light pollution to see the meteors in all their glory. However under lockdown rules, you must not travel to the countryside.

The powerful look was down to an Emilia Wickstead dress, teamed with a matching hat and shoes - perfect for the Commonwealth Day Service with the rest of the Royal Family. But Christine Ross, the editor of the Meghanaposs Mirror blog, believes there was a lot more to the outfit than just a stylish fashion moment. She thinks Meghan was sending a clear message to designer Wickstead and to people who believe the two women have a complicated relationship. Speaking on the Mirroraposs royal podcast Pod Save the Queen, she said: One of the most iconic looks is going to be her green Emilia Wickstead cape dress. That cape blowing in the wind as she walked into the church and then walked out of the church, which was such an emotional moment for so many people as it was their last formal engagement as royals. That green dress will stand out in history books I think. She goes on to explain the complicated story between Meghan and Wickstead, which came from an interview the designer did with a magazine.  Christine says that Wickstead described Meghanaposs wedding dress as simple, and taken out of context in other reports left many believing she was criticising the dress. She said: It was a pull quote from a larger interview, she really didnapost say anything negative. People thought Emilia Wickstead had really wronged Meghan, and it turned out that Emilia Wickstead hadnapost wrong Meghan, it was a pull quote.  Maybe a month or so later Meghan actually wore a custom Emilia Wickstead dress, and that situation shows the power of Meghanaposs fashion choices. She was able to say with this fashion choice, Emilia Wickstead and I are great. Weaposre on great terms, that whole thing was a huge misunderstanding and look at the lovely dress she designed for me. Emilia Wickstead is a popular British designed and is a favourite of Meghanaposs sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge.  Christine added: To chose Emilia Wickstead for that design, someone who is iconically British and so iconically royal as well, I think was very, very well thought out. I think that vision of Meghan walking back towards the car with the cape blowing in the wind, it can make you quite emotional canapost it. Christine also believes Meghanaposs first ever royal outfit sent a very clear message about how she planned to approach le in the royal spotlight. Looking back over Meghanaposs royal looks, she said: Her most memorable and most powerful message was surprisingly the one that she wore to the Invictus Games in Toronto when she was just Harryaposs girlfriend.

Experts have warned that the bushmeat trade is not only a threat to wild animals but could result in more zoonotic diseases being transmitted to humans. Dr Ben Garrod, Professor of Evolutionary Biology and Science Engagement at the University of East Anglia, Norwich, warned: “While this global pandemic started in Wuhan, it is just as possible for the next one to start in London or Washington. Currently, animal meat and body parts are being illegally transported all around the world.  “Airlines and border agencies are great at stopping people, drugs and weapons from being smuggled. But here we are with something more fundamentally dangerous than any act of terrorism or natural disaster, yet it is allowed to go largely unchecked. “Until those transporting products of animal origins internationally are stopped, we are going to see primates, pangolins and other exotic, endangered animals coming into the UK, Europe, USA and Asia.

Prince Philip has previous chosen to say such choice ditties as “You managed not to get eaten then ” in conversation with a British trekker in Papua New Guinea in  and, famously, “If you stay here much longer, you’ll get slitty eyes, which he said to a British student in China in . Charles, meanwhile, was more coy when he let slip a famously rude comment - but perhaps did not expect to be caught out by the latest in sound recording tech. It was back in , at a photo session in Klosters ski resort in the Swiss Alps, when the Prince of Wales was asked about his upcoming wedding to Camilla. The eager reporter was one Nicholas Witchell, a seasoned operator who since  had been the BBCaposs royal correspondent. In , Witchell had been the first reporter to announce the death of Princess Diana, Charlesapos first we.And in  his obituary of Princess Margaret - the Queenaposs sister - caused some offence at the Palace for references to her lovers and copious consumption of whisky.For whatever reason, on that cold day in the Swiss Alps, Charles, surrounded as he and his two sons William and Harry were by TV cameras, microphones and journalists, let slip his true feelings about the BBC man. Witchell had asked how Charles was feeling about his upcoming nuptials - William having just answered a similar question. Somewhat cheekily, the Prince of Wales replies: Iaposm very glad you heard of it anyway, before his face contorts into an awkward, somewhat exasperated grin. But then, through gritted teeth, Charles mutters under his breath: Bloody people. I canapost bear that man. Heaposs so awful. He really is.  Whether or not he expected his comment to be picked up is open to debate, but thereaposs no doubting he could see the dozens of microphones honed on his every word. William, to his credit, remains composed despite his dadaposs muttered utterances and continues with a light-hearted response. As long as I donapost lose the rings. I have one responsibility and Iaposm bound to do something wrong, he jokes. William was to be a witness at the wedding the following week.The clip recently resurfaced on Channel aposs The Royals on Holiday programme.Ten years on from that day, Witchell and the Prince had an uncomfortable reunion.  The royal correspondent came face-to-face with the Prince of Wales at an environmental fundraiser in Washington DC in March . It was believed to be the first time the two had met since the heir to the throne was caught muttering his cutting aside. But the Prince seemed unrepentant when confronted by the reporter outside the event. He gave a curt reply when Witchell asked why he still cared so much about environmental issues.  Well, Iaposll turn it round the other way, responded Charles. I think youaposd be more surprisedI didnapost care about these things. But I think particularly in terms of what Iaposve been talking about now, thereaposs an awful lot to worry about. The Prince then quickly got into his car. Speaking in  about the incident, Witchell said: There has never been an apology, and why should there be  He was probably quite right. You know, awful man. You could take the view it was the best thing that happened to me, because it showed that it is our job as BBC journalists to report fairly and accurately, but not to seek approval. Weaposre not there to be liked.  Reports suggested that, back in , Charles had perhaps hoped the cameras would leave him and his sons alone for their weekaposs holiday while preparations for his wedding continued back home. Along with the comment about Witchell, Charles was also caught muttering, I hate doing this, and, Bloody people, as he smiled wryly. That day was also famous for an endearing interaction between Charles and his then-youthful sons. As the reporters bustled in their media huddle, Charles asked William and Harry: Do I put my arms around you   William replied: No, donapost, but you can take the horrible glasses away. Charles said: Do not be rude about my glasses, I couldnapost bear ityou were. A cheeky photographer then tells the Royal trio to look like you know each other, causing the princes to lean into their dad who puts his arms around his sons. Charles then said to his sons: What do we do   And William replied: Keep smiling, keep smiling. As the clip began circulating the globe - far more of a scoop than anything the hopeful hacks could have dreamed of bagging that day in the Alps - the Palace was quick to offer explanations to mitigate the impact. Pictures of Prince William sitting next to his then girlfriend and fellow St Andrews student Kate Middleton on a restaurant terrace the previous day had appeared in the press, and aides suggested the Prince was narked by this.

But while the UKaposs lockdown shows no signs of letting up, being outdoors is not banned as authorities say spending time in nature could help with the nationaposs physical and mental wellbeing. As long as government guidelines on social-distancing are being followed, people are allowed to leave their homes in certain circumstances. Previously, the public were told they could only go outdoors to exercise once per day, to buy essential goods and to travel to workit was not possible to work from home. But new police guidelines have  expanded on that list, with officers being told to consider a string of scenarios that could be deemed reasonable under coronavirus lockdown rules. The Government has also asked councils to keep parks open, stating access was necessary for the health of the nation, while grieving families have been told they can now attend funerals and visit graveyards. Here is a list of things you are allowed to do outdoors...  . Drive to the countryside for a walkDerbyshire Police came under fire when officers used drones to film people parking their cars for walks in the Peak District. Now guidelines to police say the public can drive to the countryside to go for a walk, as long as they spend more time walking than driving. . Exercise more than once per dayThe public can go outdoors, either in the city or in the countryside, to exercise, which includes running, cycling, walking, practising yoga and attending an allotment. While police guidelines say exercising more than once a day is likely to be reasonable, it gives officers discretion in deciding whether repeated exercise on the same day can be considered a aposreasonable excuseapos for leaving home.. Stop to rest or have lunch while on a long walkPeople who go out to exercise are allowed to stop to take a short break. This includes stopping to have lunch while on a long walk. However, police can question those who take a short walk to a park benchthey remain seated longer than they have been walking. . To buy tools and supplies for maintenance and upkeep   The public are allowed to head out to buy tools and supplies, for example, to repair a fence  damaged in recent bad weather. But shopping for renovations and improvements in the home, such as buying paint and brushes to redecorate a kitchen, is not allowed. . To move in with a friend to cool off after an argumentFor some people, staying indoors can be suffocating, especially after an argument with family, friends or the people you live with. To get some respite, new guidelines say people can move in with a friend for several days to cool off after an argument at home. However, a move between households will only be acceptableit is a genuine move for several days and not hours. People are not allowed to visit friends at their address or in a public place to socialise. . To provide support to a vulnerable personYou can deliver food packages and offer care and support to vulnerable people in your area. This rule applies to all volunteers and not just those who work for an organisation or charity. While socialising is not allowed, there may be exceptional circumstances for someone to visit a vulnerable person, for example,a hospital has authorised a visit. . To attend a funeral or visit a cemetery or graveyardOn Saturday, families were told they will be able to attend a funeral to mourn for their loves ones. Speaking at the daily Downing Street press briefing, Communities secretary Robert Jenrick said: For clarity, funerals can go ahead with close family present. Social distancing measures must be respected, but families must have the opportunity to say a respectful goodbye to those that they love. . To take pets to the vetsVet surgeries remain open to the public, allowing pet owners to take their animals for emergency treatment. People are encouraged to sort medical needs for their pets over the phone where possible, such as renewing prescriptions.. To buy non-essential goods such as luxury items and alcoholThere is no need for your shopping trip to be only for essential goods such as food - you are allowed to nip to the shops to buy items such as alcohol and luxury items.

William said the temporary field hospital - - was also a wonderful example of the pulling together going on up and down the UK amid the Covid- outbreak. In a speech on Thursday, delivered via video-link because of social distancing rules, William said he was happy to be attending in digital spirit at least and later joined in remotely with a clap for carers. Their selfless commitment has touched the hearts of the entire nation.

Initially, this was for my family and friends, but I thought it would be nationally beneficial for those elderly, vulnerable and isolating.Due to the coronavirus pandemic, shoppers have found it hard to book delivery slots at leading supermarkets due to high demand.Some slots are dedicated to vulnerable or elderly shoppers, and those who can visit stores are encouraged to do so. Sabrina said: My grandparents couldn’t leave the house and my family are isolating so we couldn’t deliver her food shop this week. Using Shopping Slot, I was able to book her a next day delivery slot from Iceland and was so grateful. I want Shopping Slot to become a national brand to help others in need.

The outgoing royals sported colour-coordinated blue bandannas over their faces to protect against coronavirus as they walked two dogs in the city they now call home. The couple had settled in Canada in a £million Vancouver Island bolthole after their split from the royal family. But they relocated to Calornia as the coronavirus outbreak began to spread around the world to Meghanaposs hometown, nearer her mother Doria Ragland. Meghan can be seen carrying a bottle of hand sanitiser as she and Harry walked with beagle, Guy, and black labrador, Oz, and took a hike up a steep, tree-line path.  Both wore face coverings in line with new Calornian regulations as the US battles the pandemic during the outing on Thursday. At one point the beagle appeared to become so overwhelmed in the sunshine cityaposs heat, Meghan had to pick up the pup and carry it. The couple left Archie at home as they took an outing at a hilly local path. Harry, , sported a baseball cap, sunglasses, a t-shirt and Meghan, , was dressed casually in a tee, white trousers and trainers, carrying her iPhone with a gold case and also wearing shades and a cap.They both used blue bandannas to comply with new Calornia regulations on face coverings to combat the spread of coronavirus. A source told The Sun : “Harry and Meghan seemed in very good spirits and the dogs were clearly over the moon to be out and about. “They were hiking for over an hour and when they got back to the car the dogs looked exhausted.  “Meghan even had to carry the beagle back because he was so worn out from the heat. There was one security guard with them during the hike. The pair packed their dogs into the boot of a silver Kia car before heading home. The coupleaposs outing came just hours after Meghan and Harry delivered free meals in West Hollywood for charity Project Angel Food.  The charity helps critically ill people who will be at serious riskthey are infected with Covid- as is close to Meghanaposs heart, as her mother supported it for years. One of the charityaposs recipients, Daniel Tyrell, , told of coming down from his apartment to pick up his food parcel at the main entrance. Daniel, who has HIV, said he did no recognise his visitors at first. “My phone rang, and a lady said, ‘Hi, this is Meghan from Project Angel Food.” “I said, ‘Oh, do you want to meet me downstairs ’ - I didn’t realise it was THE Meghan at this point.’Daniel said he spotted two black-out SUVs on the road outside and realised this was no ordinary visitor. “I knew they was something going on.” As he approached the front door, Daniel said he spotted a familiar face. “I recognised Harry first because I saw his red hair, but he didn’t say anything,” said Daniel. “Then I looked at Meghan and put it all together.

The images, which were first released by state-owned China Daily newspaper in , were published again last month on Twitter before being deleted. In the pictures the seal to one of the refrigerators inside the lab appears flimsy and loose, while a lab worker dressed in gloves and a mask can be seen pulling out a box which contains virus samples. Minsters said earlier this month that there are fears the global pandemic may have started from a leak in one of the labs storing the deadly virus. It has previously been claimed that Wuhan Institute of Virology, where it is alleged coronavirus may have been leaked from, has been carrying out experiments on bats from the cave believed to be the source of the  coronavirus  pandemic. The  Mail on Sunday  reports that that the Institute has been carrying out research on bats captured from caves in Yunnan, where the Covid- genome is thought to have come from. The caves are , miles away from Wuhan, the Chinese city which is now infamous for having been the epicentre of the global coronavirus pandemic. Scientists say it is highly likely that Covid- first came from bats, but first passed through an intermediary animal before jumping to humans. The Wuhan lab has previously dismissed allegations that coronavirus came from their facility, while the Chinese Embassy has described speculation around the labaposs activities as hasty and reckless allegations.  Bats are believed to have responsible for six outbreaks of coronaviruses, including the Covid- pandemic, but experts insist problems only occur when people come into contact with the creatures themselves. Chinese scientist Shi Zhengli describes the Wuhan outbreak as a wake-up call for the world and work is now taking place around the globe to find a way to prevent another pandemic. She said: What we have uncovered is just the tip of an iceberg. The mission must go on. Bat-borne coronaviruses will cause more outbreaks and we must find them before they find us.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here “I had my first customer yesterday who said he wanted to get a refund on  packets of -pack toilet paper and  units of one-litre sanitiser, Mr Drake says in his video on April . Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities.

It was then that we decided to put our foot on the ball and pause.#We conveyed that decision to the centre and ceased taking calls on the subject.  We needed time to develop a clearer DFC view on the situation.#Whilst it is not our responsibility to take the lead on solutions for the league , it is our duty to attempt to ensure that the future of Scottish Football remains promising for all the clubs.#To that end, we have we have worked tirelessly to achieve solutions to help those who were being disadvantaged and sought ways to help them.#We have discussed options with a iety of member clubs to show solidarity to the clubs most negatively impacted by the SPFL proposal.  Relegated clubs must have financial assistance to help soften the landing so they can begin the next season on more equitable footing.#Through our discussions it appears that there is an appetite to provide ious forms of support from other member clubsthese clubs are in fact relegated.  Further details of these acts of kindness and solidarity will be worked out amongst the member clubs.#Also, we are sorry to disappoint all of the conspiracy theorists by saying that we were never exposed to any ‘deals’ from either of the Glasgow giants.  They both acted, as we would expect, with complete professionalism.#Additionally and most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes does not give us much of a chance and this is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.#There are several things that have to be in place in order to deliver a proper opportunity of achieving a better foundation for Scottish Football’s future.  First, a working group should be assembled and must have members from the highest levels of Scottish Football with long-term interest in the future success of the game.#We need to agree a set of goals that will be the basis of reconstruction which takes into account current and future wants and needs of media member clubs’ financial benefits and sporting integrity as a basis.#It is our belief that after speaking to numerous clubs that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to set up an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.  The centre will have to accept and support the will of the members.#We do believe the centre has made mistakes in this process, namely not taking into consideration any financial fallout to their member clubs and publishing of the incomplete ballot results, which has put Dundee FC in a position to receive criticism and undue torment.#If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal.#We would like to thank the fans for their patience, and most of the member clubs for their cooperation and support during this time.  Make no mistake, we continue to have a daunting task ahead of us, but we are encouraged by everyday acts of kindness, resolution, and humanity that we are all sharing as we get through this together.  Stay safe and hope we see you soon in a newly revamped league.#lthr  gtltstronggt🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

This was a highly unusual end to the season, to say the least, and not the one any of us would have preferred, but all three deserve enormous credit for their performances over the course of the season.“With the turmoil and uncertainty caused by the Covid- outbreak, there was always going to be a highly-charged and passionate debate about how we secure the future of Scottish football.“It is no exaggeration to say that this was an existential matter for Scottish clubs, with many of them telling us they were at real risk of going under unless the situation was resolved very quickly, so I’m pleased that the game has moved decisively.“Whilst more than % of clubs agreed with the directors’ written resolution, it’s clear that others were strongly opposed.“There has been talk of voiding the season, making emergency loans and so on, but what has been agreed today is not just the best way forward, it was the only realistic way forward and I now call on all  clubs to move forward in a constructive and positive way.”SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster also had his say on tonight’s development.He said: “Prior to this positive result, we were unable to make the vital end-of-season payments, which will provide a leline to so many clubs in the lower isions. From our detailed discussions with clubs, many were facing an enormous cash-flow crisis. We have moved as quickly as possible to try to resolve this unprecedented situation.“We’ve achieved the % agreement threshold in the Ladbrokes Premiership, Championship and Leagues  and  and will now be working as quickly as we can to get the end-of-season payments to members in the three lower isions by the end of this week.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

dundee fans want answers from john nelms over vote u turn","story":"Dundee chief John Nelms told fans a ‘yes’ vote was the best possible deal for the club after supporters questioned his U-turn in the SPFL voting saga.Managing director Nelms responded to an email from the Dundee Supporters Association, which comprises  clubs and over , members, after they demanded answers over the Dens Park side’s stance on the controversial SPFL proposal that handed titles to rivals Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers.The Dark Blues have been at the centre of the storm that engulfed Scottish football since last Friday’s requested deadline where their ‘no’ vote failed to arrive with the SPFL and subsequently saw the club holding the decisive call for five days.The club issued a statement at lunchtime yesterday outlining their side in the furore but fell short of declaring their intention to later change to a ‘yes’ vote which sparked outcry from a number of Dark Blues fans when it emerged.The vote saw the SPFL resolution passed but also brought forward league reconstruction talks with Hearts chair Ann Budge joined by Hamilton counterpart Les Gray leading the working group – a stipulation Nelms had made clear would be in exchange for a ‘yes’ to minimise the financial harm dished out to some clubs by the original deal and get the best deal for the Dee.The reaction has been mixed across the Dundee fan group, some positive, many refraining from casting judgement, but amongst that there has been real anger with some fans left dismayed and some even feeling betrayed by the change of decision from Nelms, prompting the request for answers from the DSA.The concern from many is the move did little for the club’s interests while, at the same time, gted the Championship league title to their fiercest rivals.The email sent by the DSA committee yesterday and seen by the Tele said: “We are sure everyone felt a sense of relief yesterday with the casting of the Dundee FC vote in regards to the SPFL resolution of April  but are disappointed that the club has not yet offered a statement to clary the Dundee FC position or explain the change of mind in the voting process from a ‘No’ to a ‘Yes’.“We would urge you therefore to make one as soon as possible to put an end to the conjecture which still continues.“Supporters of Dundee Football Club have been patient over the last few days while trusting that the club would make the correct decision in not just our interests and but the interests of Scottish football as a whole and would welcome a public statement of clarity.“The statement issued by the club yesterday was thought to be vague in some quarters and we feel did not clary or explain our voting position and so we would like to request that the club do this as soon as is practically possible.”Nelms moved quickly to try to assuage fears from the fans responding in a statement: “By way of further explanation of our statement from April , Dundee FC submitted its vote to the SPFL and issued its statement simultaneously.“There was no changing of our vote at any time that day as has been reported in some channels.“If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal on  April .“We have achieved the best deal possible out of a situation that was going to be bad for us in any iteration that was being proposed.“Let us be clear, no matter what the proposal looked like, the majority of the clubs in the Premiership and the Championship are proponents of promotion relegation.“Any solution that did not include this would not have enough support to be passed.  Therefore, the SPFL chose to include it to expedite the conclusion, but without considering the ramications to all clubs.“Most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes did not give us much of a chance.“This is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.“As stated yesterday, reconstruction could help ensure the future of Scottish football as a sustainable and profitable one.“After speaking to numerous clubs we believe that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to establish an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.“We stated that the SPFL will have to accept and support the will of the members.  As you saw in the SPFL statement last night, they already have started this process.“In conclusion, from a very poor situation we have gotten the best result for Dundee FC and for Scottish football as a whole.“Of  teams,  have voted yes in a democratic ballot and for most, the important thing is the monies can be distributed and they can work on survival plans for their clubs.“It is time now toour focus on staying safe and planning for the future of Dundee FC.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The most-quoted line is a statement of Scottish independence.Mr Noble said the idea behind the forthcoming book, titled Conquered by No-one, was that  modern-day Scots would write about the  signatories to the Declaration.But Mr Noble himself is writing about two iniduals ndash William Ramsay, Earl of Dalhousie, and Malise IV, Earl of Strathearn.Authors of other chapters include Linklater ndash former editor of The Scotsman ndash and historian Murray Pittock.Mr Noble said: ldquoWhat I see as the underlying justication of this publication is to try to raise the profile of the Declaration of Arbroath as the most signicant document in Scottish history.Mr Noble said the -year-old document introduced the concept of government by consent to Scotland.ldquoI think thatrsquos the critical thing and why itrsquos the most important document in Scottish history, said Mr Noble.ldquoItrsquos recognised by the United States Senate as a contributing factor in the discussions that took place before the signing of the Declaration of Independence in  and itrsquos something that has had a status in the English-speaking world for quite a long time, but lost its traction in Scotland.Mr Noble said a recent survey of Scots found that around a third did not know much about the Declaration.The same poll revealed that many supporters of Scottish independence viewed the Battle of Bannockburn as more important, said Mr Noble.Asked for his own thoughts on Scottish independence, Mr Noble noted that he has lived in England for many years so would not be allowed to participate.Buthe were permitted, he would choose to remain in the United Kingdom, he said, albeit with the hope that a federal system would eventually emerge.Mr Noble said: ldquoI donrsquot think Scotland is going to stay as it is ndash I think decisions in the main should be made in Edinburgh but I believe in shared sovereignty and I think therersquos a value in being part of the UK.He added: ldquoIrsquom not yet persuaded that complete independence is in Scotlandrsquos interests but I certainly think we should be going a lot further in that direction than we are at the moment.Mr Noble is the chairman of the Royal Caledonian Trust, a charity that supports the education of Armed Forces children. He is immediate past president of the Caledonian Society of London.During his career as a teacher, he was headmaster of Bexley, London, which was then the largest school in the capital. When he was a schoolboy himself, he attended Peebles High School.Conquered By No One will be published later this month by Hammer  Mirror Books.

She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

She dipped her bushy tail into the water then ran back.She stood a safe distance from the flames and then shook her bushy tail, sprinkling the flames with droplets of water. The flames fizzed for a few moments, but it didnrsquot make any dference.So the squirrel ran back to the river and once again dipped her bushy tail into the water and ran back to the fire.Once again she stood a safe distance but shook her tail, and once again sprinkled the fire with small droplets of water. As before, the flames fizzed for a moment but it made no dference.Just then a hare ran by and saw what the squirrel was doing.ldquoYou foolish animal, said the hare, ldquoyou canrsquot put the fire out by yourself.The squirrel looked at the hare and nodded.ldquoI know she said, ldquobut the forest is my home so Irsquom doing what I can do.Then she asked the hare, ldquoWill you help me The hare thought for a moment. He didnrsquot live in the forest like the squirrel, but it was important for him as he would use the forest often to eat bark and twigs when there was no grass to eat.ldquoI wouldI could, said the hare, ldquobut the thing is I donrsquot have a bushy tail like you.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the squirrel, ldquobut you do have long ears. You could use them.The hare stroked his ears.ldquoSo I do he said, ldquovery well I will do what I can do.And so the squirrel and hare ran to the river.The squirrel dipped her bushy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, collecting as much water as possible.They both ed to the fire, and stood a safe distance away. The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and as before the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made very little dference.Just then a wild cat came by. She saw what the squirrel and hare were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the wild cat, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the two of you.The hare looked at the wild cat and nodded.ldquoWe know he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the wild cat and asked her, ldquoWill you help us The wild cat looked at the squirrel and the hare, and licked her lips.Normally they would be a good lunch option.

The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related. We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature. We share a common ancestor with every creature and plant yes, even with the trees.So while I, like us all, yearn for the end of the lockdown for many reasons, I am also going to try to make the best of it by being more aware of naturersquos wonders that are literally outside my window, while I stay at home to help keep others safe."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-economy-braces-biggest-recession-300-years-due-lockdown---likely-recover","story":"While adjusting to le in isolation has been dficult, businesses have been hit particularly hard by the restrictions, with the budget watchdog now warning the country could suffer its biggest recession in  yearslockdown continues into the summer.The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the economy could shrink by  per cent this spring, with unemployment levels reaching . million over the coming months - its highest level since the s.The struggling economy has sparked comparisons to the financial crash in , and the Great Depression of the s, but experts are now predicting the outcome will be much worse.Experts now believe the UK is headed for its biggest economic slump since , when the country was hit by a deep freeze that spread across Europe.Temperatures plummeted on January , bringing with it the worst winter in  years and freezing over several countries, including France, England and Russia.The lsquoGreat Frostrsquo, as it came to be known, lasted for three months and sparked food shortages, thousands of deaths in France, and a huge deficit to the economy.The coronavirus pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record  per cent by June, the Office for Budget Responsibilityhas warned.A drop this big would mark the largest decline ldquoin living memory, Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR has said.However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak stressed that this forecast is just one possible scenario, and it merely suggests the scale of what the country is currently facing will have ldquoserious implications for our economy.He said: ldquoWe came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses.ldquoOur planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities and households.ldquoOur plan is the right plan.Mr Sunak assured that the government would not stand by and will act to support the economy, adding that the OBR expects the economic impact of the pandemic to be temporary.Despite being forecast for a signicant decline, the UK is expected toto its pre-coronavirus economic growth by the end of this year, with the OBR stating this amount will depend on how long the lockdown lasts.The OBR predicts that any drop in growth will be reversed in the three months to September, as the economy starts to recover.However, it warned that the pandemic may have a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise to . million by the end of June.Unemployment levels are currently . million, marking a rise from . per cent to  per cent.Unemployment rates are expected to remain high until , before dropping back to four per cent, according to the OBRrsquos forecast."},{"url":null,"title":"11-year-olds-thank-letter-delights-ambulance-staff","story":"Sarah Brady, , a primary seven pupil at Wallyford Primary School, was taking part in the first lsquoClap for our Carersrsquo event on March  with mum Samantha.She noticed the ambulance sitting at the end of her street so quickly drafted a letter and ran over with a rose and gave it to them.The letter read: ldquoThanks for everything yoursquore doing for the world, love Sarah Brady.Samantha said: ldquoThe clap was amazing.ldquoA few days later the ambulance had to come back to my house for my partner.ldquoThe ambulance lady said that two men were in Wallyford recently and someone gave them a letter and that they were really overwhelmed.

Grieving relatives are left to tell their stories on social media, devastated that their loved-onersquos death doesnrsquot seem to count, distressed at the lack of knowledge or discussion around care home guidelines.There is still no honest or plausible explanation for why so few coronavirus tests are taking place, or why tracing ndash which has helped Germany and South Korea keep deaths down ndash was abandoned so early on.

Even with thoughts of lugging heavy panniers full of day-to-day necessary detritus.Even knowing Id have to scrap with private hire drivers at junctions and dodge buses in cycle lanes.Thats a large part of the current joy. No scrapping, no narrow misses, no stress.The roads are so much emptier that the nagging fear always following at my shoulder, that heightened sense of potential doom, is gone.There are streets so quiet on my route that you can almost forget about motorised traffic and freewheel, carefree up the middle of the road. It is glorious.Even in the centre of the city the roads are largely silent. While its eerie, definitely, for the cyclist it is exciting. The roads are mine.Elsewhere, children cycle along with their parents, in that zig zaggy way little kids do, unfussed about straight lines. Older couples cycle side by side, leisurely, having a lovely time.Its not only the newfound freedom of space that makes the roads more enticing, its the lack of noise. Theres a nice silence, easy on the ears. Birdsong is more pronounced.Of course, its not all utopia. There are still idiots treating the almost empty roads as a racetrack challenge and lets hope these chumps feel the force of the law. Police forces in some parts of the UK have said the number of motorists exceeding speed limits has doubled since the start of the coronavirus lockdown.But, broadly, we are being given a glimpse of what cycling cities could look like. Its being widely reported that the sales of bikes are up. Cycling Scotlands figures show that in some areas the number of cyclists has doubled or more.Other countries have seen similar increases in cycling and have seized the opportunity to make cities more bike and foot friendly. Cities in Germany are turning roads into bike lanes to help people with social distancing.Road layouts have been adapted with relative ease using removable tape and mobile signs. The redesign of urban spaces helps everyone as it takes pressure off parks as people take their exercise on the roads, and gives more space to pedestrians trying to keep their two metre distance by stepping into the road.London is also looking at repurposing space on its busiest roads to make more room for cyclists and pedestrians. This is the perfect time for Scotland to do the same.There will be plenty of people tempted by cycling but who are afraid of going on the roads, given how congested they usually are.Novice cyclists are not now competing with as much traffic and so its the perfect time to gain confidence, find routes that work for them and develop a healthy habit that they wont want to kick when the lockdown lts.It also plans to reduce speed limits across the city. Were seeing, right now, what a car free city centre could look like. And its pretty glorious, as long as we have the public transport network to support it.Could we also introduce reduced speed limits  Cycling is a safe mode of transport - the danger comes from external forces and, even in lockdown, drivers are still putting their foot down and making roads less safe. If we could further curb that with an increase in mph zones, what a dference it would make to the feel of the roads.Deep rooted health inequalities dont go away during lockdown people still have diseases linked with inactivity.Cars destroy health - at an inidual and societal level. They destroy the environment.There are so many sound and sensible reasons for pushing active travel and cutting car use - we know them well already.The dference now is that this is such an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of lightening the vehicular load on our roads.The means of creating wider pavements and segregated cycle lanes are easy to do, simple toto normal when lockdown lts. This, though, is a point for and a point against.Its hard to argue against simple, easily reversible measures. But when the pandemic is over we want to keep people using active travel. Hopefully, having had so many more people using cycling as a means of getting around, there will be wider support for current cycling strategies.Maybe there will be a push to take them further.It would be a great shame to see the current enthusiasm for cycling wane as lockdown is lted.It is joyous to see families cycling together, couples out on the roads, novice cyclists confidently owning the tarmac - all with reduced fear of vehicles.It is joyous to cycle fear-free down the middle of a road. It is a boost to mental and physical health, the fresh air, the bird song, the pure pleasure of physically activity.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

Both Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, and the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon were at pains to stress in their daily briefings that a precipitate easing of restrictions could endanger the progress that has been made, and waste the enormous sacrices that have already been made by so many.They were right, too, to resist calls for a timetable on possible changes. If, as all the UKrsquos governments have accepted thus far, policy is guided by the science, it would be foolhardy to assume that the worst is past until there are solid grounds for believing matters are under control.At best, we may have done enough to slow transmission, to buy time for the NHS to prepare, and to ready infrastructure to deal with this deadly disease. The questions that remain over the availability of PPE, or reliable testing, or other less urgent supply chains indicate we cannot yet be sure even of that.Unless and until a vaccine is developed and ready for distribution, every countryrsquos response to the coronavirus has been one of containment alone: the disease will not go away. A premature end to lockdown could make matters worse ndash and psychologically, it will be much harder to reintroduce necessary measures once they have been loosened.Butwe should not expect a firm timetable for the reopening of schools, factories or shops, we can at least enquire what the current thinking is on the criteria that will allow such decisions to be made. That mightinclude a combination of factors: confident assessment that the number of deaths each day is falling, widespread reliable testing to see who may have immunity, or certainty that capacity for treatment is not under the colossal strain that has existed to date. And it will not be ato the status quo ante it is much more likely to be limited opening of businesses or services with distancing enforced.To obtain accurate information on the disease and its toll, to assist the front-line staff and volunteers who have received less support than their tireless work deserves, and for reasons of basic humanity, we also need to focus much more on care homes and areas of the system other than intensive care. Badges showing support for carers are not a bad idea, but they are a token, not a comprehensive solution.Similarly, it is not to belittle the efforts of fundraisers such as Captain Tom Moore, to say that their hugely impressive contributions need to be lined up against the cost of this crisis. There will need to be a detailed description of how the economy can restructure unprecedented government subsidy is welcome, but must be effectively directed ndash particularly for the poorest, and for small to medium businesses, on whom recovery will depend.

Irsquom lying in bed, have been for half an hour, trying to beat back the fragments of thoughts, the noisy nonsense of insomnia, breathing in and out, my brain churning through indefinable problems which probably donrsquot even really exist, until finally, I admit defeat, walk downstairs, make myself a cup of caffeine-free tea and try to work. My only company is the birdsong ndash and, perhaps, you. Because I know, during this lockdown and pandemic, there are others out there, somewhere in this city, somewhere in the land, somewhere on Twitter. This is lockdown. Days and nights donrsquot work like they used to.They neither work for those of us trapped in our homes in quarantine, nor for those on the frontline. One study found that one-third of healthcare workers suffered insomnia during the Covid- epidemic in China. Those reporting sleeplessness were also more likely to feel depressed, anxious, and have stress-based trauma. I canrsquot help feeling my own sleep struggles are nothing compared with the torment of being unable to drop off while also knowing you have to go, exhausted, into a hospital the next day, to do your work of trying to save lives, perhaps with equipment that is inadequate.But all of us listen to the news. All of us have heard the stories about the extension of lockdown, the impact on the economy, the rising figures in intensive care, the elderly dying in care homes. Almost all of us have lost the routines that kept us rooted. Almost all of us are worrying about something or somebody. We are all in touch with the collective trauma of this pandemic.Sleep expert Dr Donn Posner, speaking at a Hard TH Chan School of Public Health online forum, recently described the current pandemic, with its lockdown conditions, as a ldquoperfect storm of sleep problems. He observed: ldquoThe actions that wersquore taking to protect ourselves can not only precipitate problems with sleep, but lead to chronic problems with sleep.We probably all know the common advice on whatrsquos called better sleep hygiene ndash donrsquot drink caffeine after lunchtime, avoid too much alcohol, do plenty of exercise, turn off your screens in the evening, create a bedtime routine, meditate, aim for around seven hours sleep, avoid daytime napping. Yet that advice doesnrsquot seem quite adequate for these times of fear and social distancing. Our bodies are bound to react to the combination of being cooped up and under the kind of stress that triggers the fight-or-flight response. One clinical psychologist, Lucy Johnstone, interviewed by Wired last week, noted: ldquoI think itrsquos important not to medicalise our responses, whether emotional or physical, and of course these are intertwined. Personally, I would be more concerned about someone who is not feeling alarmed by the threats we are facing.In my view, worse than insomnia is worrying about insomnia. Even sleep experts like Posner advise not trying to force ityou canrsquot sleep. ldquoGood sleepers, he says, ldquoput no effort into sleep whatsoever. Thats why Im up and working. That and the fact that I do think there may be a place for working our fears out during the night. Waking in the early hours may simply be a natural response to what wersquore collectively going through.LETHARGYJust as the nights are wakeful, so are the days slumpy. Itrsquos the middle of the afternoon, the kids are under their duvets, and I wonder where my husband has disappeared off to, only to find he is there in bed reading some council report. I ask himhersquos okay, loading the word ldquookay in that way that makes it a shorthand for, ldquoHave you got a persistent dry cough, headache, loss of taste or fever  He nods to say hersquos fine ndash too much effort to properly reply.I try to read a book on the sofa and find myself swamped by the kind of woozy tiredness I havenrsquot felt since pregnancy. Soon Irsquom looking up ldquolethargy and the virus\" ndash its my symptoms search of the hour. Unsurprisingly, tiredness is associated with the illness. But, says the internet, lethargy is also a symptom of the cabin fever all of us are getting during lockdown, and the best antidote to it is moving around.I tell the children: ldquoItrsquos not true that wersquore too tired to exercise ndash the only thing that will give us energy is exercise. No-one moves. The idea of getting them out the house wearies me.So I slump back onto the sofa and look up ldquoweariness and the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"eco-fascism-environment-green-light-far-right","story":"With the world in crisis and belief in democracy crumbling, extremists are starting to embrace green politics. Writer at Large Neil Mackay reportsITrsquoS just over a year since the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand, when  people were shot dead at a mosque and Islamic centre ndash the killings live-streamed online.What marked the atrocity out as dferent from other white supremacist attacks, was that a manesto believed to have been connected to the gunman spoke of the acts being inspired by \"eco-fascism\". The manesto talks of environmentalism and population growth. It states that: ldquoContinued immigration into Europe is environmental warfare.Christchurch, however, wouldnrsquot be the last time that far-right violence intersected with the environment. Four-and-a-half months after Christchurch, on August , , a gunman shot and killed  people in El Paso, Texas. The killings were the deadliest attack on Americarsquos Latino community in history. A manesto, which police believe is connected to the alleged gunman, said the El Paso killings were inspired by what happened in Christchurch and motivated by ldquothe Hispanic invasion of Texas.The El Paso manesto is called \"An Inconvenient Truth\" ndash mirroring the title of Al Gorersquos  documentary on the threat of climate change. In the manesto, the writer says the people of America are ldquotoo stubborn to change their lestyles ldquoso the next logical step is to decrease the number of people in America using its resources. If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of le can become more sustainable.The writer also talks of oil, agriculture, and recycling the destruction of the environment and the impact of environmental degradation on future generations. ldquoOur lestyle is destroying the environment of our country, the manesto reads. ldquoThe decimation of the environment is creating a massive burden for future generations. Corporations are heading the destruction of our environment by shamelessly over-harvesting resources.One man has pleaded guilty to the Christchurch killings, and one man is awaiting trial for the attack in El Paso.Are these shootings the canary in the coal-mine, however  Are they warning us that the most extreme elements of the far-right are starting to co-opt environmentalism  Once the coronavirus pandemic is over, who knows how politics will realign and ideology sht and change.With climate change denial now recognised widely as an untenable scientic position, some extremists have latched on to environmental concerns, added them to racism and anti-immigration beliefs, and created a curdled form of eco-fascism.Professor Gary LaFree, from the University of Maryland and a former director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, has studied the role of environmentalism for a new breed of far-right extremists.ldquoTheyrsquore building an ideology, he says, adding: ldquoYou notice theyrsquore referring to each other hellip which to me makes it scarier. Itrsquos more like a social movement.Academic, activist and author Naomi Kleinrsquos new book, On Fire: TheCase For A Green New Deal, warns of the growth of eco-fascism. Klein has been called ldquothe intellectual godmother of the Green New Deal Movement. The Green New Deal envisages a greening of the economy, and reforms creating a fairer job market.Klein says: ldquoMy fear is that, unless something signicant changes in how our societies rise to the ecological crisis, we are going to see this kind of white power eco-fascism emerge with much greater frequency, as a ferocious rationalisation for refusing to live up to our collective climate responsibilities.At the heart of the problem is this: whattodayrsquos idealistic climate campaigners fail to change things  Whatactivists like Greta Thunberg donrsquot succeed in making governments act for the good of the world  Could environmentalism then be hijacked by the far right As the climate deteriorates, and governments fail to act, the far-right is already starting to seek to exploit public fears and discontent. There has long been academic theorising that in order to fix an almost insurmountable problem like climate change, society might find itself turning to some form of authoritarian \"strongman\" party or government, as liberal democracy may be too weak to take the measures required.Professor Michael E Zimmerman, a philosopher and environmental historian, describes eco-fascism as \"a totalitarian government that requires iniduals to sacrice their interests to the well-being of the lsquolandrsquo .It is easy to see how the far-right could manipulate environmental issues and pit them against immigration. So far, the far-right has been pretty much in the climate denial camp ndash but it looks asthatrsquos starting to change. In France, Marine Le Pen, leader of National Rallyndash until recently the National Front ndash has started to go green. France and Europe, says Le Pen, should be the worldrsquos ldquofirst ecological civilisation.One prominent member of RN, Jordan Bardella, said that ldquoborders are the environmentrsquos greatest ally itrsquos through them that we will save the planet.Le Pen has said the inidual is ldquonot simply a consumer or producer but ldquosomeone rooted, someone who wants to live on their land and pass it on to their children. She says someone ldquowho is rooted in their home is an ecologist and that those who are ldquonomadic hellip donrsquot care about the environment they have no homeland.The French thinker Jean-Yves Camus, who specialises in the extreme right, says environmentalism has ldquobecome part of the RNrsquos political agenda, but itrsquos a specically far-right form of environmentalism ndash very identitarian.Camus believes many far-right voters ldquosee society as like a biological organism that should be kept in its original state. According to this line of thinking, when a foreign body is introduced, it causes disorder ndash hence the anti-immigration stance. Logically, the same goes for nature: we must respect the natural order.The hardline Alternative for Germany Party has also seen an environmental sht. The youth wing of Germanyrsquos anti-immigrant party has been urging its leaders to drop climate denial.Naomi Klein says: ldquoThere is rage out there that is going to go somewhere, and we have demagogues who are expert at directing rage at the most vulnerable among us while protecting the most powerful and most culpable.Perhaps one of the biggest potential recruiting sergeants for the far-right when it comes to the environment would be any greening of industry which hurts rather than helps ordinary workers. Extremists could step in and say that they are the ones who can offer ecology and protect the poor.Already, therersquos widespread suspicion across the west that some environmental policies have done more for big business and the middle classes than either the planet or the poorest. The Yellow Vest protests in France were triggered after a backlash against green taxes which were seen to hurt the worse off in society.Josep Borrell, the EUrsquos new foreign policy chief, was recently attacked for comments he made about young climate activists. He said: ldquoI would like to knowyoung people demonstrating in Berlin hellip are willing to lower their living standards to offer compensation to Polish miners, becausewe fight against climate change for real they will lose their jobs and will have to be subsidised.Borrell may have offended supporters of Greta Thunberg, but there is a genuine risk thatany Green New Deal is executed in a way which isnrsquot socially fair, this would be a fatal error easy to exploit by a far-right movement thatrsquos starting to embrace environmentalism.The concerns about Polish miners are on point. Poland is heavily dependent on coal, and Warsaw has refused to sign up to the EUrsquos  climate targets, which would lead to coal mining being phased out.There are complaints in Romania that plans to reskill miners have benefited decarbonisation firms rather than workers. Firms are making money from the \"reskilling\" market, but jobs and investment in new sectors havenrsquot appeared.Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, one of the worldrsquos largest asset management companies, has said that because of decarbonisation ldquowe are on the edge of fundamentally reshaping finance. Could the creation of a post-pandemic green economy benefit the rich, not the poor ldquoThe danger is that the public money hellip put into greening the European economy will instead merely subsidise greenwashing, says Daniela Gabor, professor of economics and macrofinance at UWE Bristol.In other words, taxes pay for big business to show off green credentials. Meanwhile, jobs are lost, no new jobs are created, and the planet isnrsquot helped.Itrsquos a recipe for public cynicism, and risks a popular rejection of mainstream political attempts to fix the climate crisis.Labourrsquos Keir Starmer has warned that any Green New Deal must ldquomean good jobs in new green industries. Starmer says we need to recognise that ldquothe poorest bear the least responsibility and the heaviest burden of climate breakdown.The development of eco-fascism also coincides with the growing crisis for democracy in the western world. Dissatisfaction with democracy is at a record high, particularly in Britain and America. One study by the University of Cambridge found that % of those questioned were dissatisfied with democracy.ldquoAcross the globe, democracy is in a state of malaise, said the reportrsquos author, Roberto Foa. Ominously, the economic crash and the refugee crisis are both seen as contributing to dissatisfaction with democracy. Now coronavirus has arrived as a new peril.The study suggests that the rise of populism is not a cause of dissatisfaction but a symptom.In the UK, for example, satisfaction with democracy rose steadily from the s for some  years ndash peaking just after the millennium.At the same time as the appeal of democracy waned, fears over the climate rose sharply. Developed and industrialised nations are feeling the effects of climate change now, with floods and fires, droughts and other wild weather.The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, says the world is ldquoway off track when it comes to dealing with the climate emergency, and time is running out.The UNrsquos assessment of global climate found that  was a record-breaking year for heat. More people are also on the move due to extreme temperatures and flooding. Once again, the connection between the environment and migration is there waiting for the far-right to step in and exploit it.In , the worldrsquos oceans were the warmest on record, with at least % of seas experiencing a heatwave. Surface air temperatures were the hottest ever recorded. For the nd year in a row, more ice was lost from glaciers than gained ndash this caused sea levels to go up to their highest since records began.Before the postponement of the UN climate summit in Glasgow due to coronavirus, Guterres was setting some hope on Scotland. ldquoWe need more ambition on [emission cuts], adaption and finance in time for the climate conference, COP, in Glasgow, UK, in November, he said, prior to the lockdown. ldquoThat is the only way to ensure a safer, more prosperous and sustainable future for all people on a healthy planet.COP stands for the th Conference of the Parties ndash the UNrsquos Climate Change Conference. When the conference was held in France in  it adopted the Paris Agreement and signalled a step-change in how the world looked at the climate crisis, with nearly  nations agreeing ambitious goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions and limit temperature rises.The Glasgow climate conference is now delayed until , but calls remain for it to kickstart a new green tech revolution. Researchers at Oxford University, led by Mike Mason of the School of Enterprise and the Environment, believe harnessing new technology could reduce carbon emissions by at least one billion tonnes a year.Examples of new green technology include converting cheap renewable energy ndash from wind, sun or wave ndash into zero-carbon fuel.But any Green New Deal needs to work for people as well as the planet. Unless ordinary workers are brought along, with new jobs and decent wages, then the fracture point between the economy and ecology will be a gt to extremists.Too often green measures are seen as hurting the poorest. A ban in England on the sale of wet wood and coal for domestic fireplaces, for example, was criticised for pushing people in rural areas into poverty.For Naomi Klein the rise of eco-fascism means that while therersquos a growing tendency among far-right extremists to no longer deny climate change, what they will continue to deny is any common humanity between people across the world.A far-right vision of environmentalism will be Darwinian, a brutal case of \"us versus them\", of pulling up the drawbridge. If we donrsquot act quickly and intelligently, then race and immigration could soon come to contaminate the debate about the environment.ldquoLet there be no mistake, says Klein. ldquoThis is the dawn of climate barbarism. And unless there is a radical change not only in politics but in the underlying values that govern our politics, this is how the wealthy world is going to lsquoadaptrsquo to more climate disruption: by fully unleashing the toxic ideologies that rank the relative value of human lives in order to justy the monstrous discarding of huge swathes of humanity.Klein wants to douse the flames of eco-fascism. The way to do that is to create well-paid, secure jobs for anyone whose livelihood is put at risk by the turn away from fossil fuels ndash and for the state to take on the burden of retraining workers of all ages. Thatrsquos the real Green New Deal. Thatrsquos the way to kill off eco-fascism while itrsquos still in its cradle.THE DEEP ROOTS OF ECO-FASCISMThe far-rightrsquos move to embrace the environment as part of its ideological agenda is nothing new. Itrsquos just been dormant for a long time.As with much of modern fascism, its roots lie in Nazi Germany. Nazi ideology hinged around the concept of \"Blood and Soil\" ndash the idea that Aryans had a mystical connection to their nation and a duty to protect the land.There was an almost romantic obsession with rural le in Nazi Germany, and it was seen as superior to urban living. Many Hitler Youth were sent to work on farms as ldquoonly those of German blood may be farmers.The Blood and Soil ideology found its most perverse outlet in the shape of both Nazi eugenics and lebensraum, the idea that German people should expand into lands once owned by their German ancestors. Nazi art and film also gloried nature.The first eco-terrorist was neither right nor left. Ted Kaczynski, otherwise known as the Unabomber, was a former mathematics professor who left society and his career to live off grid in the wilds of Montana.He saw himself as a revolutionary destined to overthrow ldquothe system and despised technology. Between  and , he killed three people and injured  others in a series of bomb attacks across the USA against universities, airlines and other industrial targets. Kaczynski even tried to bring down a passenger jet.Like todayrsquos eco-fascists, Kaczynski wrote his own manesto entitled Industrial Society and its Future, in which he justied his bombings by saying that modern le was destroying humanity.

Long since abandoned, the dilapidated walls and rusting machinery remain rooted, crumbling monuments to an almost forgotten age when Scottish island mined slate put a roof over the world.ldquoBelnahua was very ghostly, says Baker, an Edinburgh-based outdoor writer whose new book The Unremembered Placesexplores some of Scotlandrsquos wild, often overlooked locations and unravels the fascinating stories embedded in their past.ldquoIt was eerie and poignant and beautul, he continues. ldquoThe journey to Belnahua adds to its mystique. The island has that rare frozen-in-time quality to it.ldquoLots of the places I ended up visiting had that same feeling.Part travelogue and part social history, Baker has recorded his journeys to locations that have fallen off the beaten track: hidden caves, a quiet Highland reservoir with a deadly human toll linked to its construction, and secluded islands.Despite doing the footwork to become familiar with each before setting off, often these \"unremembered\" places still managed to capture Baker off-guard either by their enigmatic beauty or a tiny detail that shed new light on their seldom-told histories.At Belnahua, once at the epicentre of a mammoth slate industry which saw it and its neighbouring islands send Dalradian slate around the world, Baker picked his way through the \"ghost village\" with its abandoned homes, corroded machinery, rusted steam-driven crane and flooded quarries.Beyond the physical remains, he unravelled a much deeper story of island communities surrounded by turbulent waters which carried an astonishing number of vessels ndash a fair number of which would end up wrecked as they battled against the harsh, stormy Atlantic waters.ldquoThat brutality of the winter storms and their location on the edge of the Atlantic, would have made it an incredible place to live, says Baker. ldquoAt one point the water around Belnahua was one of the busiest watercourses around the UK, which is incredible to think of.A series of economic and natural calamities including a storm which Baker describes as being ldquoof epic proportions devastated the industry, leaving ft deep mines flooded by the swell of seawater which drenched their workings, and families with no work or reason to stay.Once home to more than  people at the slate industryrsquos peak at the end of the th century, by the s the island was empty.ldquoIt feels like it has been deserted, reflects Baker, whose book links the growth of the slate industry with bustling sea traffic and the rise of lighthouses to guide vessels on their way.ldquoIt was a rapid turnaround of being a very populated island with many people living on a tiny patch of land, to being completely deserted within a matter of weeks.ldquoIt has a feeling of rapid desertion to it. Itrsquos quite eerie but fascinating with machinery lying where it was left and no-one going to remove it.ldquoThe houses are there, he adds. ldquoBut what struck me was the row of deserted cottages which housed the slate miners and their families.ldquoIt banks to a small beach that is just footsteps from the front door to the water. I stood there and thought what an incredible place to live, but equally what a very hard and brutal place.ldquoItrsquos only really when you visit these places that you can transpose yourself into what it must have been like to live there and experience that.ldquoAnd Belnhua is very visceral and very real.While some \"unremembered\" spots are remote and challenging to reach, such as Blackwater Reservoir in Lochaber where he was taken aback by the small graveyard and the human cost of creating the dam, others are far closer to urban le.The Glen Loin Caves near Arrochar in West Dunbartonshire are the reputed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his army after the Battle of Methven in . However, Baker points out that much more recently they were a focal point for working-class sporting prowess.For two decades from the s, groups from the hard-working shipyards and poverty-stricken Glasgow tenements made the area their playground, taking up weekend residence in the caves from where they would climb the rocky walls of the \"Arrochar Alps\".The climbing clubs they formed would go on to lay the foundations for the sportrsquos modern standards, techniques and ethics.However, as years passed, the location of the caves they frequented became largely forgotten Bakerrsquos search for them resulting in a frustrating challenge over jagged rocks, through pines and across overgrown gashes in the hillside before finally stumbling into the dark, gaping entrance.ldquoSome of the places are pretty remote and hard to get to which may be a discouragement to people seeking to visit them, says Baker, as he explains the balance to be struck between drawing attention to secluded, forgotten spots and attracting people to visit.ldquoWe want to share the wonderment we are seeing and share these stories, he adds, ldquobut we donrsquot want to degrade the places or their mystery.Thatrsquos a particular issue for the \"wild\" islands he visits, dotted across Loch Awe and Loch Shiel, havens for wildle, some harbouring centuries-old graveyards or, in the case of Eilean Fhianain, once home to Irish missionary Saint Finnan and with its ruined chapel and burial grounds.Other islands revealed another side to their previously well-documented character.Baker explored Inchkeith Island, three miles north of Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth, aware of its prominence as a stop-off point for vessels between Fe and Edinburgh since the th century but surprised to discover its links to a bizarre attempt to invade the Port of Leith.ldquoI often had an idea about the story that was going to unravel in a particular place, and then found out other elements, says Baker, whose book covers eight destinations, each with its own character and signicance.ldquoIt was fascinating to find out about Inchkeithrsquos strategic importance and how, in , it was used as a sort of staging post for a fleet under the command of Scots-born John Paul Jones, who effectively founded the US Navy.A squadron of five ships had gathered at the mouth of the estuary near Dunbar, sparking panic in towns along the coast.Sailing under a commission for the Continental Navy for the American Colonies, John Paul Jones was known for attacking British naval and merchant ships and launching land offensives.His sights on this occasion, writes Baker, were set on Leith.Having penned a letter threatening to attack the port, his vessels took anchor at Inchkeith Island to await their next move.As luck had it, a fierce westerly gale put paid to Jonesrsquos plans. Having been prevented from reaching the port, Jones decided it was ldquoimpossible to pursue the enterprise with a good prospect of success.Baker, who has previously written about stories and landscape of the Cairngorms, says while the \"unremembered\" locations explored in his book may seem disparate, they share common links.ldquoScotlandrsquos wild histories ... speak of immeasurable social change, of the movement of people through time and landscape, he writes. ldquoYet they are often lost, overlooked or passed by.ldquoThey still have cultural relevance, but we donrsquot tend to give them enough signicance. Thatrsquos the common theme.The Unremembered Places by Patrick Baker is published by Birlinn on May "},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  39 s Country Life  an army at work on the home front","story":"It wasnrsquot until we moved to the country that I needed a diary the way fish need water.

Everyone has a story to tell, and my brief one simply involves a visit to the supermarket.This is a nerve-wracking experience now, less frequent than it used to be and hedged in with so many rules that you fear breaking merely through forgetfulness or habit. So you approach the entrance, saying to yourself: ldquoRemember to do this and not to do that. Donrsquot get into a fight. Donrsquot pick your nose.And then you get in and find a young woman blocking the narrow entrance aisle so nobody can get past, while she texts something. At last, after causing a back-up at the door, she finally finishes and, ignoring the wipes and free gloves, goes over to the fruit and veg, where she starts picking up ious peppers with her hands, testing them before putting them back. Unbelievable.I mention it partly to tell you a story about something even more unbelievable that I saw in a supermarket back in BV . This middle-aged woman was doing the same as the young pepper-woman, only with bakery rolls. She picked up several and felt them for consistency. Then, when she had made her selection, she used the provided tongs to put them in her bag.Somewhere in her brain she must have acknowledged that you were supposed to use the tongs, but she hadnrsquot computed that these were provided to stop you handling the products. They were just ... one of these things. They were a matter of etiquette, like the peculiar array of culinary implements that posh people provide for ious dferent dishes.Well, now theyrsquore telling us that etiquette is going to change forever AV . As regards tongs, theyrsquoll be used for all sorts of shopping and yoursquoll be urged to bring your own. Sounds like a plan, even though you can fair mangle a Danish pastry with them sometimes.Therersquos also that moment when you fear yoursquore going to drop your item. Imagine the embarrassment that would cause now. Yoursquod be surrounded by security guards with tasers, as alarms shrieked and crime scene tape was placed round the floored bakery product.Other new social rules include excellent news about the discouraging of kissing and hugging outside family members or a ldquobubble of close friends. Oh joy. If only it could be extended to include family friends and friends. Imagine a ban on cheek-kissing. Le would be so much better.In future, pedestrians will be urged to walk on the right side of the pavement, which I think is already the case with London escalators. But, on the escalators, thatrsquos to allow busy, important people to overtake.You know that people will just do the same on the pavements as they already do on the roads when you leave a decent distance between you and the car in front, and the impatient maddies overtake into it and fill up the space.So much for humans. Animals will also be affected by the new rules. Cats will be kept indoors, meaning the gardens of neighbours wonrsquot be so full of excreta and mangled songbirds.Back to humans, and another revolutionary suggestion is that muzak could be turned off in shops so that people didnrsquot have to move closer to each other to hear what theyrsquore saying.Yoursquove got to admit this is all rather grand. Itrsquos just a shame that it took something so calamitous and horrible as the coronavirus to bring it about.Busy keeping busyWHENCE this mania for exercise  Folk whorsquove never lted a finger before are now waddling aboot in the parks and public spaces. They have taken the Governmentrsquos advice about ldquoonce a day as instruction rather than restriction.Indeed, experts are now warning the lieges about overdoing it and injuring themselves. I nearly did that myself when, bereft of my weekly gym visit, I rescued a whole load of equipment from the garden shed and the attic, and nearly broke my back trying to assemble it.I must say though that, once it was up and running, and I had a wee go on it, I felt marvellous afterwards. Endorphins and whatnot whizzed round my heid and I said to myself: ldquoI must do this more often.Never done it again since. The stuff just sits there in the spare bedroom, or man-cave, along with all the guitars I canrsquot play and woodworking and DIY tools that I canrsquot work.Instead, I have concentrated on exercising my mind, catching up with a load of reading of actual books.

Rememberyou donrsquot know what an extrovert is thinking, you havenrsquot listenedndash andyou donrsquot know what an introvert is thinking, you probably havenrsquot asked!\"CASE STUDY: The Hayes familyFiona Hayes has been working from home for five weeks with her husband Scott and two-year-old daughter Thea around for company.The -year-old, from East Dunbartonshire, said lockdown has brought challenges but she and Scott have enjoyed the close family time it has allowed.Fiona, associate director at creative agency Wire, said: ldquoEverything changed overnight. I had to get used to a way of working from home and my husband Scott has been furloughed from work and has effectively become a stay-at-home dad. I have been lsquopretendingrsquo to go to work every day to Thea which has meant me hiding upstairs and coming back for lunch and saying lsquomummyrsquos home. I had been at home with Thea on maternity leave so I know it is a lot for Scott as he is doing the bulk of the childcare during the day.ldquoThere have been some challenges with lockdown but it has been nice to have that extra family time. We have a very close extended family and even go on holidays together, so it has made a nice change to be on our own. I think it has brought us closer together having that unided family time. Although there are moments when I think he needs time on projects in the garage.Husband Scott said although Fiona working from home isnt new although the fact she is having to sneak up to the attic with coffee so their toddler doesnt get upset at her coming and going certainly is.He said: ldquoThe good side of it is getting more family time. Im planning lots of fun activities to keep our daughter entertained and Fiona and I are still having movie nights and making nice meals together to help make le feel as normal as it can be right now.Scott added: ldquoIts given me a new appreciation for Fiona. Her work has a flexible working policy, so she tends to be at home more with Thea. I now understand why she could be so frazzled after a day at home.\"The hard parts are definitely the uncertainty and worrying about family. But also the lack of time to myself, even the drive to work is good thinking time that I used to take for granted. I have been throwing myself into projects around the house, like turning my garage into a makesht games and cinema room. If anything, it gives us an extra room so we arent all on top of one another.CASE STUDY: The Healey-Ryder familyWhisky marketing executive Kieran Healey-Ryder and his husband Kristian have been imaginative with entertainment in lockdown.They have enjoying the community spirit with their neighbours in Strathbungo, in Glasgows southside, and this weekend joined in a virtual murder mystery evening. They have also been coming up with novel ideas to keep their two daughters, who are aged  and eight, occupied.Kieran, , said: \"I think we have been surviving with a combination of humour, coffee and amazing neighbours. We are testing our arts and crafts skills every day. And we did a hug in the post to send friends and family.\"It involved cutting out two hands, decorated, tied together with ribbon and sent with a message in the post.\"Last weekend they organised an Easter egg scavenger hunt which the community embrace.Kieran added: \"Neighbours decorated and displayed Easter eggs in their house, and on our daily exercise we set about to find them. We already had a great a community here. Now we are all just a wee bit more connected. \"Kristian said coping with lockdown has been better in Glasgow.He said: \"People are much friendlier and community minded here than the south-east of England.\"We are fortunate to have space at home and the local green spaces. I wonderit will disproportionately affect people that may not have access to that.\"Kierans job meant he travelled often but lockdown has seen him working from home with the family around, and they have been together for meal times a lot more.Kristian added: \"Cooking is an important part of it. We are more mindful of what we eat, how we eat. We are all reading every day and listening to podcasts and audio books.\"While Kieran has been concentrating on work, he has had some welcome distractions.\"Lunch together is a plus, as is the comedy post. Every day I receive at least one note under the door whilst Im working, increasingly comedic, ridiculous, and creative.\"The couple has also been attempting to create lesson plans and the girls have been following Carol Vordermans maths tutorials which they say has transformed how their eldest approaches maths.Kieran added: \"One activity thats kept us sane is that we decided to support and lend a hand to a charity.\"We asked the girls to chose a charity to find out about and support. The girls have eaten their school work and this gave them a project to focus on. They very sweetly chose Shelter Scotland as a charity close to home and a fundraiser I had done.

This coming Friday, at .pm on the dot, around  fans from all over the world will be logging in to join a virtual tasting by one of the greatest bottlers of them all ndash Adelphi.If you know whisky, that one world will have made you stop and take notice. If you donrsquot let me explain. Adelphi is like the Linn of hi-fi, the Aston Martin of motoring, the Gleneagles of hotels ndash basically,you see anything with that name on a bottle, you know yoursquore in for a serious treat.So why does a company like this need to get involved in virtual tastings  Surely they donrsquot need the money, or the publicity  Connal Mackenzie, group sales manager with the company, says the reason theyrsquore doing it is much more basic than that.ldquoThis is the only way we can get out to the Adelphi people, he says. ldquoIf it wasnrsquot for this virus, wersquod be gearing up for festivals.ldquoWe were going to be launching a new whisky list anyway, and we usually try to fall in to some kind of festival to do that, get feedback them and pour some drams for people.ldquoWe wanted to bottle up some samples and get them to the people who are missing out on festivals around the UK and further afield. This was the ideal  to do that.Interest in everything that Adelphi produces is usually huge, and new bottlings usually sell out very quickly, so it came as no surprise to me when Mackenzie told me that when the event was publicised, the tasting packs ndash five new expressions that will be tasted during Fridayrsquos session ndash sold out within  hours, with interest from as far afield as Australia and America.Mackenzie will be conducting the tasting, alongside Alex Bruce, managing director of Adelphi, and Arthur Motley, of Royal Mile Whiskies, which sells Adelphi whisky and has worked closely with them on Fridayrsquos event.But he is at pains to stress that the tasting is no exclusive event. ldquoA total of  people will have a tasting pack ndash however, this is not just for those people. Yes, the tasting pack will be part of the discussion, but there will be plenty of people around the world who have bottles of Adelphi open ndash or any whisky for that matter ndash and we want them to join us.ldquoAlex, Arthur and myself will be just having a general chat about whisky ndash yes, the focus will be on our whiskies ndash but we want to invite anyone whorsquos a fan to open a bottle and join us.So, to the critical question ndash whatrsquos going to be on show  Irsquom speaking to Mackenzie by phone, but I can almost see the glint of excitement in his eyes. ldquoWersquore pretty pleased with this list ndash and we hope the people who join us will be too hellipSo here are the drams:bull Ardnamurchan   Year Old Single Cask .% not- this is a bottling from Adelphirsquos own distillery, and the first taste of the actual whisky ahead of an release hopefully later this year.bull The Glover  Year Old Batch  .% not- a special mix of Ardnamurchan and whisky from the legendary Chichibu Distillery in Japan.bull Linkwood   Year Old Single Cask .%bull Caol Ila   Year Old Single Cask .%And just for a special treat:bull Bas Armagnac   Year Old Armagnac Single Cask .%So, how can I get involved, I ask Connal. ldquoWell, he said, ldquoeven though all our tasting packs have sold out, donrsquot let that bother you.

Of four Scottish publishers I spoke to last week, the best cited a  per cent fall in paid-for advertising and two reported it had all but vanished.Last week two other Scottish weekly papers were forced to suspend publication, the West Highland Free Press and the Stranraer  Wigtownshire Free Press, and while their publishers have every intention of ing to print there are no guarantees. So the money from the UK Government advertising campaign canrsquot arrive a moment too soon.Mr Dowden has also written to producers of the UKrsquos  biggest brands to make sure their online advertising policies do not block ads from appearing next to news about the pandemic, as some have been doing, because not only is the information providing a public service, but virus stories are so dominant that such a block is effectively an advertising ban.So Mr Dowden and Michael Gove in the Cabinet Office ndash a former reporter for Aberdeenrsquos Press  Journal ndash are doing what they can to help the newspaper industry survive the crisis, but the Scottish Government also has a role to play. The Scottish Newspaper Society has been in constant dialogue with Scottish ministers and civil servants for the past four weeks to try to achieve similar support for the sector here, and among the requests are an extension of the business rates holiday to news publishers, a support fund and more government advertising as the UK Government has just done.Other countries have launched news support programmes, like Denmark where the government is paying compensation for advertising losses of up to  per cent from a media fund worth poundm, and the devolved Flanders government in Belgium, which also has a compensation package for lost revenues as part of a poundm fund for sport, culture and media. A package is also under discussion in Ireland and most other European countries are working up support programmes.The Scottish Government included newsagents in the list of permitted retailers and acknowledged that journalism and newspaper production is a key service, a crucial recognition which allowed publishers to continue printing, distributing and selling their titles, so there is no doubt that ministers accept the sectorrsquos value. With some , people working full-time in Scottish news publishing and  per cent of all adults using Scottish news brands every month, it would be quite somethingthey didnrsquot.On a very basic level, those , jobs depend on it, as does the flow of trusted and authenticated information, but so too does community cohesion and the continuity historic titles provide in recording and reflecting events large and small in momentous times such as we are experiencing now.However, recognition will count for nothingnews businesses are no longer financially viable, so we hope the Scottish Government will follow the example of legislatures across Europe and beyond and back up their words with deeds.ldquoNewspapers are at heart of the British media and essential to its vibrant mix, wrote Mr Dowden. And that certainly includes Scotland.John McLellan is Director of the Scottish Newspaper Society"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11229382.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-scots-businessman-trapped-peru-gets-home-says-airport-checks-pretty-lax","story":"Forty-nine-year-old Gordon Livingstone was one of an estimated  British nationals who was trapped in Peru for over three weeks after an official UK repatriation flight bringing nationals from the country landed in London with  on board.Now he has make his way home to Motherwell by spending nearly pound on a French Government flight from the north east Peru city of Iquitos where he was living, to the capital of Lima and a scheduled Air France flight to London Heathrow.:, a week still arriving in Scotland ndash and not one is tested for Covid-And he has admitted surprise at the lack of health checks when entering Britain.\"There was no testing, most workers at Heathrow dont have masks on. Compared with the detailed testing and precautions in Peru, the UK appears pretty lax. \"However, it may be that, as with many countries, the belief is that the masks dont protect you, so perhaps its an intentional decision not to wear them.\"Mr Livingstone, who had been stuck in Iquitos since a lockdown on March , got back home early last week.\"Travelling internally in Peru, they did temperature checks on every passenger,\" he said. \"They were also very strict at the airports about keeping one metre apart, and everyone wore masks.\"Coming into Peru [on March ] I got a random temperature check and people a few days later said everyone got them.\"Mr Livingstone had forced to charter his own planes to help  stuck in Iquitos access a flight from the capital Lima back to London. But he said it had to be cancelled because the flight to the onward to the UK, organised by Hong Kong on Friday was set at an incredible price of pound-a-head.The government rescue flight prioritised those that were \"most at risk\" from the effects of coronavirus - namely elderly people and those with underlying health conditions.But Mr Livingstone from Motherwell said that he and others had \"given up on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office coming for us\" and had been \"trying to make things happen ourselves\", adding that the Peru lockdown, which meant it had closed its borders, came without warning.:Trapped in Peru -Scot forced to set up UK coronavirus rescue flights after being abandoned by governmentThe group had been looking to other governments to help them get out of Peru.All  in Iquitos managed to get on the French organised flight from Lima military airfield.Concerns for the Peru group surfaced as data emerged that the German government was chartering  times more rescue flights than the UK and was flying home more than , travellers from across the world.The German embassy in London revealed it had now repatriated , German nationals from  countries on  charter flights over the previous two weeks.The UK had in contrast rescued just , British nationals from Wuhan and Peru on charter flights, including passengers on two British Airways planes that landed at Gatwick airport last Tuesday.It has been estimated that , Britons are stranded around the world as countries closed borders and grounded commercial flights in an effort to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

There are some other countries that are relaxing some aspects of their existing restraints. They are confident they can do so without prejudice to the overall health of their populations. We are looking at what those countries are doing, we are looking at our own data and evidence.ldquoBut one of the things we absolutely will not do is precipitately relax any of the current restrictions before we are confident that we have a scientic check in the round that allows us to make the right decisions.The Cabinet Office Minister told Sky Newss Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \"It is the case that we are looking at all of the evidence but we have set some tests which need to be passed before we can think of easing restrictions in this lockdown.\"It is entirely understandable, of course, that there should be a public debate about how we approach these dficult choices.\"Later, Mr Gove made clear the Government was developing a strategy for so-called ldquocontact trace and testing, so people could be tested in the community and be tracked through the use of technology. He mentioned a telephone app that could help in this regard.He stressed UK ministers were taking a ldquodeliberately cautious and measured approach guided by the science and that a number of things had to happen before the Government was confident enough to begin to lt the restrictions these included testing and contact tracing, the NHS capacity being as resilient as it could be and that the number of deaths was falling.ldquoIt is onlywe can be certain that we have all of those factors in place we can confident about relaxing some of the measures we currently have in place, explained the Cabinet minister.Askedthere would be contact tracing within the community within three weeks, Mr Gove said ldquoover the course of the next few weeks the Government would be able to increase the number of tests and made clear he was ldquoconfident it would meet its target of , a day by the end of this month the current number of tests remains just over , a day while the capacity is , a day.He told the BBCrsquos Andrew Marr Show: ldquoIt is also the case we hope to have community testing as well but I canrsquot give you a precise timescale. We are working as fast as we can to ensure we can increase the number of tests and also develop contact-tracing infrastructure.Asked about the Government telephone app, the Scot explained: ldquoIt is in beta-testing, at the moment. One of the things we want to ensure is that when we start operating at signicant scale we want to make sure it is robust and that it works.ldquoIt is better to have no app than a bad app to paraphrase a principle we have outlined in respect to testing. We are currently developing it. We are making sure it is inter-operable with other apps that other countries are developing as well.Earlier, Gavin Williamson, the UK Education Secretary, took to social media to dismiss an imminentto school in England.He tweeted: \"No decision has been made on when we will reopen schools. I can reassure schools and parents that they will only reopen when the scientic advice indicates it is the right time to do so.\"Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the Governments Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies[SAGE], said he was \"optimistic\" about finding a vaccine for the Covid- coronavirus with advances in science.But he acknowledged \"the truth is we dont have another vaccine for any other human coronavirus\" and said finding a safe and effective treatment for the latest strain was \"not a given\".He told Sky News: \"I hope we would have a vaccine towards the end of this year - but thats a vaccine in a vial, its a vaccine that we believe to be safe, a vaccine we think might be effective.\"Its crucial to realise having a vaccine in itself, in say a million doses, which you know to be safe and you believe to be effective. That is not the end game.\"The end game is making sure that it is truly effective. Its effective in the elderly, effective in young children, effective right across the age group in all populations.\"And then you have to manufacture that in billions of doses to administer them to the world. That is an enormous scientic challenge, its also an enormous logistics and delivery challenge,\" he added.Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said a shipment of PPE that was due to arrive in the country was \"a few days supply\" and \"may be enough to avert an absolute crisis over this weekend\" but added that \"it doesnt solve the longer term problem\".Meanwhile, speaking about Mr Johnsons health following his treatment for coronavirus, Mr Gove said: \"The Prime Minister is recovering well. Hes in cheerful spirits. He had the opportunity to talk to Dominic Raab, his deputy, the First Secretary of State, on Friday.\"And the Prime Ministers instructions to the rest of us in Government were communicated by the First Secretary of State when we had a conference call yesterday morning.\"Mr Johnson was treated for Covid- in intensive care at St Thomass Hospital in London earlier this month and is now recuperating at his official country home of Chequers in Buckinghamshire."},{"url":null,"title":"ridge-sunday-andrew-marr-show-review","story":"Michael Gove has been working on a Donald Trump impersonation.At least that was the impression from watching him on the Sunday politics shows. What prompted the Scot to reveal this new talent was the same thing that led the US President to let rip last week ndash a newspaper report.Mr Trump was furious over a New York Times article that said he had failed to heed expertsrsquo warnings about coronavirus, and as a result precious weeks had been wasted in preparing for the coming disaster.The Sunday Times, under the headline, ldquoRevealed ndash how the government sleepwalked into pandemic catastrophe, essentially laid the same charge at the door of Boris Johnson and his government.In particular, the paperrsquos Insight investigation team said Mr Johnson missed five meetings of the COBRA emergency committee. Moreover, ministers sent to China hundreds of thousands of items of Personal Protection Equipment , material currently in short supply in some places.Serious charges. Important, then, that they be tackled head on. As luck or planning would have it, the Minister on Sunday duty was Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the man usually called upon when the Government has fires to put out.Fireman Michael had quite a sht to put in. Before getting to the Sunday Times he had to damp down acres of speculation about the lting of social distancing rules ndash the Great Unlocking as opposed to the Great Lockdown. The first to get back to normal, the Sunday papers reported, would be schools on May .Mr Gove put his red pen through that suggestion. ldquoNot true.Ridge turned to the Sunday Times story, askingPPE had been sent to China. Mr Gove refused to engage. ldquoI wonrsquot get into a to and fro.Adopting the disappointed teacher persona she does so well, Ridge moved on to Mr Johnson and the missed meetings.She reminded Mr Gove of what he had said in  when he withdrew his backing for Mr Johnsonrsquos leadership bid and entered the race himself. To wit: ldquoBoris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead. Had he proved that correct ldquoThe idea that the Prime Minister skipped meetings that were vital to our response to the coronavirus is grotesque, said an increasingly animated Mr Gove.Next on Ridge on Sunday was Jon Ashworth, the Shadow Health Secretary, who was not impressed by the Govester. ldquoThe weakest rebuttal of a detailed expose in British political history.Consider Labourrsquos period of ldquoconstructive engagement with the Government over, or at least as far as Mr Ashworth goes.Mr Gove finished his interview with Ridge before am. He had under an hour before he appeared on The Andrew Marr Show. More stonewalling would not do.He had his answers ready this time. The PM had not attended the five meetings, but that was because such discussions were led by the relevant Secretary of State. The UK did send PPE to China but it was not from the UKrsquos pandemic stock, and the UK had received far more than it gave.His dander up, Mr Gove, a former journalist, attacked the messenger.

Points will be awarded for such things as being able to speak English, having a job already lined up and meeting appropriate skill levels. They will also have to meet a minimum salary threshold, which the guidance informs is generally £,, although a lower salary might be accepted in some circumstances.Under this new system, low-skilled workers will not be able to receive visas to live and work in the UK.The new system however, will not apply to EU citizens already living in the UK by December , this year. They will be eligible to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.Highlighting the impact immigrants have had in the fight against coronavirus, Mr Carmichael called on the government to rethink its plans and support key workers.“When the immigration proposals were first announced earlier in the year I called them short-sighted and a risk to the long-term future of island communities,” he said.“We are already seeing the potential harm we risk to our communities and our country. It is time that the government started rethinking its plans.“Around the UK we are seeing the positive impact that immigrants are having as key workers in the fight against coronavirus. That the government has not reflected on this at all in developing its advice on immigration policy is disappointing. If immigrants can be essential workers in our country’s time of crisis, then they deserve our support to remain here afterwards.”Mr Carmichael added: “Last week I joined my colleague Christine Jardine in calling for foreign nationals working in the NHS in this crisis to have the right to remain. There can be no clearer case for their rights than the work they are doing right now.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Charity workers based at CLAN House in Aberdeen came up with the idea of running a weekly quiz online, asking for a small £ donation per player.Regular hosts include Steph McCann, fundraising team manager for CLAN and her husband Lee, who regularly hosted quizzes when he was a student at university. The quiz, devised by Steph and the fundraising team at CLAN, includes questions on local knowledge as well as current events, entertainment and travel.Steph said: “We have had a fantastic response from people, not only from the north-east but across the UK to the CLAN Sunday Sofa Quiz.#We were looking for a way to continue to engage with our supporters, keep people entertained at home, and to help raise vital funds for people affected by cancer.#Over  teams took part this weekend, with the number taking part growing every week.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue.

It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind.

However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward. He had to pay my dental bill and a £ fine.

That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time. We lost - and I swearit wasn#t for our young goalie Calum Montgomery making one save it could have been . But in essence, that is where I started from in management.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in . I hope that recording will make its way into Tobar an Dualchais one day.I met Willie Matheson just the once long ago – Allan insisted I come with him to the hospital where Willie was in a wheelchair, frail but with bright eyes and a welcome smile.

He probably had a measure of anxiety when he started to feel so unwell.Mr Montgomery phoned Liz and his two other sisters Anne and Helen before he was placed on the ventilator on the Saturday afternoon, telling them that it would probably be for a day or two.But our gut feeling was that it wouldn#t be a day or two. That was the last conversation we had with him, said Liz.That has been one of the hardest things, not being able to be with him.

He had a large circle of friends and could definitely be described as a people person. His quick wit and humour were enjoyed by his nieces and nephews who thought the world of him.Liz explained how a doctor had phoned her sister before he died and assured her staff would be with him.The doctors and nurses handled the situation so professionally and were exceptional in their care and treatment of David, she said. We are thankful to all the nursing and medical staff in the critical care unit and know they did all they could for David and they too were upset his condition did not improve.We really appreciated how David#s neighbours, friends and farming colleagues stood on the roadside to pay their respects at this dficult time.

When I last spoke to my former P teacher on March , having bumped into her on East Bridge Street in Enniskillen, she was still as thoughtful as she was when she was teaching me at Jones Memorial Primary School between  and .She wanted to know how I was, asked about my work, and told me to #keep going# just as she did when encouraging the -year-old me to read and write. I discovered my love for creativity and expression in her classroom, which has shaped my le.During our brief conversation, she told me she had been to see her grandchildren a few days before and spoke of her fears over the coronavirus.Stay safe you were the last words she said to me as we walked away. That was Mrs Mathers in a nutshell always looking out for others, always caring.But four weeks later, she would be dead, cruelly taken by Covid-, leaving her family, friends and former pupils mourning the death of a remarkable woman.It is strange to feel sad at the death of someone you only really knew for a year of your le, but Mrs Mathers was an exceptional person and good teachers leave a mark on you. When they die, it almost feels like a tiny part of your childhood goes, too.This week, I found out more about the woman who inspired me and the moments leading up to her death when I spoke to her children, Michael Mathers and Joanne Kirwin, who were still reeling from her passing last Thursday.Her daughter, Joanne, had a choice to make last week as her -year-old mother lay in South West Acute Hospital with Covid-: hear her distinctive voice on the telephone, possibly for the last time, or let her go on a mechanical ventilator without saying a word in the hope that each breathe she took would help rid her of the coronavirus.She chose the latter, dreaming that her formidable mother would overcome the cruel disease, so she could get back to doing what she loved most spending time with her family.Joanne#s brother, Michael, faced similar agony from his home in Glasgow as he liaised with hospital staff and relayed updates back to his sister in Manchester. Both have lived away from Fermanagh for years and last week, neither of them had ever felt as far away from home nor as helpless as the invisible killer prevented them from being by their mother#s bedside.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseYvonne Mathers with grandchildren Matilda, Ella and six-month-old Ottilie FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappYvonne Mathers with grandchildren Matilda, Ella and six-month-old OttilieYvonne, a healthy mother, grandmother, sister, friend and a much-loved former teacher who inspired a generation of children, passed away while a member of the hospital#s medical team wearing a mask and a gown gently held her hand in the absence of her family. The word we keep using is shock. It#s very surreal for many reasons because in part we are in lockdown and so it doesn#t feel like it#s really happened. We#ve not gone through those rituals of mourning and that order of how you do things has not happened, Joanne told The Impartial Reporter.I thought I probably shouldn#t call hershe was going on the ventilator JoanneWe knew the coronavirus was coming we all heard about it, but without sounding arrogant about it, a lot of us thought it wouldn#t happen to us. It hasn#t really hit us yet, it feels like something you see on TV, she said.Joanne recalled the moment her mother was advised to go on a ventilator, explaining how she toyed with the idea of phoning her, having spent time exchanging text messages.I thought I probably shouldn#t call hershe was going on the ventilator. She was probably going to be quite breathless and I didn#t want to take that breath from her.Part of me thinks should I have, then the selfish part of me wants to remember her voice and when I last saw her and how happy and healthy she was, she said.Joanne smiles as she recalls her mother#s love for her children Matilda, five, and six-month-old Ottilie and their love for her.She always encouraged us, she always wanted the best for us. She always wanted me and Michael to be happy and be settled and not have to worry about us, she said.Yvonne had worked for the Western Education and Library Board Advisory Service and previously taught at Jones Memorial Primary School.She did take the teacher in her home, laughed Joanne.Michael and I had to remind her that #we are home now and are not your pupils#! She could be in teacher mode as most teachers tend to be, so there were overlaps with school and home le, she said.While Yvonne adored teaching, she told Joanne that her biggest joy was having grandchildren, joking that she liked being able to hand them back.She loved having grandchildren apart from the fact she said it made her feel old. She used to come over to Manchester, but it wasn#t to see me, the only reason was to see the girls! They brought her real joy, she said.With her mother now gone so too is a part of her, admits Joanne.I am  now, but I always had somewhere to go. She used to say no matter what age her children were, she was always our mum. But no matter what age you are, you#ve lost your mum, that place to go, that sense of safety that you don#t think you need when you#re .But when it#s gone, you#ve lost that, there is a hole, that driving force is no more. I will never forget the love and happiness she got from the girls and how happy she made them, as well as how happy they made her, she said.Mum was taking all the precautions MichaelScattered around Yvonne#s now-empty home at Ashbourne Manor - where last week, neighbours took to the street to hold a poignant vigil for her - are bottles of hand sanitiser, an indication of how seriously she was taking the pandemic. When her son, Michael, arrived at the weekend, having travelled back for her burial outside Portadown, where she was originally from, he found evidence of how worried his mother, who was prone to chest infections, was.Mum was taking all the precautions, he said, describing his shock.Even when she got the positive case, we thought, #Sure you#re strong enough to work through it#, and then when we got the call on Thursday of last week at .pm, the nurses were saying she seemed quite stable, then by half five, we got a call that she was not going to make it and by seven o#clock, she had passed away. That#s a microcosm of how I am feeling it is so up and down, he said.After feeling ill for more than a week, Yvonne had a choice of going into hospital and took it, believing that she was in the right place.Even in this period, she was still making smart decisions. She was very self-aware, she took it in her stride. She said, #That#s what I have got#, and spoke very positively of the nurses.The last I spoke to her on the Sunday night, she was getting tired she was advised to go on the ventilator and thought it was the right thing to do.She recognised what she needed to do, so all of her choices were the right ones at the right time, said Michael.His mother was hugely supportive, he says, particularly during dficult periods of his le.She told me, #You are always going to be my son#. She was very encouraging, but she was very direct when she needed to be, very black and white, no real nonsense.If she needed to tell you to pull your socks up, that#s what she did in a loving and caring way. She kept us all together and I couldn#t have asked for more throughout my le.Among the children she has inspired is Michael#s daughter, Ella, who is now eight-and-a-half.The biggest regret is that she is not here to see Ella, Matilda or Ottilie grow up and become women themselves. That#s the biggest challenge in the future, encountering birthdays and looking around the room and realising that she#s not there.She wasn#t just a mother, or a grandmother, or a friend. She was an important role model in many people#s lives, he said.This was true.I once got  out of  in my spellings and she asked me what I had for breakfast.Coco Pops, I replied. She laughed and told the rest of my class to eat Coco Pops.I remember telling mum we had to buy some, texted my old classmate, Roisin Francis, this week.It takes a big heart to shape little minds.Mrs Mathers had a huge heart and didn#t just teach, she touched all our lives.

Photo Stephen Davison Pacemaker PressBy Lisa SmythApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland may have to remain in lockdown until July, according to a Northern Ireland expert in viral epidemics.However, Dr Michael Donnelly said removing social isolation measures slowly and carefully could potentially stop a second surge of the deadly virus.Dr Donnelly, a clinical epidemiologist, said it is imperative that people across Northern Ireland are not complacent when it comes to reducing the spread of coronavirus.He was speaking as figures released on Sunday revealed one further person has died from Covid-, bringing to  the number of people here who have lost their lives during the pandemic.Read MoreDr Michael Donnelly:Opinion We must brace ourselves for an onslaught of Covid- cases but by July the worst will be overThere is still very much we don#t know about this virus, said Dr Donnelly.There are some people who will become infected who get a temperature and a slight cough and there are other people who it will kill.We still don#t have effective treatments, we can give patients paracetamol and oxygen, but we#re finding out that ventilators that we had pinned so much hope on might not be as effective as we first thought.Research has shown that % of patients who are ventilated end up dying.There are going to be signicant measures in place for some time yet, it#s important that we don#t jump the gun. There will be a very high price to paywe get it wrong.We#re already looking at what has gone wrong, but I would say the biggest mistake that has been made has been to not take this virus seriously enough.This isn#t a rehearsal, this is real and people are dying. We are beginning to see less people dying, but that doesn#t mean we can relax.It might be inconvenient to have to stay at home, but the choice is very simple. If sitting in the house for a few weeks is the price you have to pay to stay alive, it seems to me to be a fairly good price. You will have the rest of your le to make up for isolating now.While statistics released by the Public Health Agency on Sunday show  people in Northern Ireland have now died, the total death toll is likely to be signicantly higher.This follows the publication of new figures on Friday, showing Covid- deaths were a third higher than originally reported.Another  people have tested positive for the virus, bringing the total to ,, with a total of , iniduals tested.Dr Donnelly said he believes increasing the number of people being tested for the virus, as well as establishing who has immunity, will play a crucial role in lting lockdown measures.He said officials should use antigen and antibody tests that have already been developed, despite concerns about their effectiveness.We don#t have the luxury of time to make sure they are perfect, he said.We have to use what is available to us now. However, he stressed it is vital that a vaccine is safe to use.If we are rolling this out to millions of people we don#t want to find out that it is harmful, he said.Despite this, he said he is optimistic that a vaccine can be found before the end of the year.Although he warned that it may have to be altered each year, similarly to the influenza vaccination.He continued: If we open everything up gradually, we can stop a second wave.I would like to think we will be through this by the first week in July and similarly I would like to think that people who are shielding will also be able to begin toto normal.The key to this is testing who has the virus and establishing who has had the virus and has some immunity, but it is important that we remove social distancing measures slowly.Officials are coming under increasing pressure to reveal their exit strategy once the predicted surge is over, amid claims the Cabinet is split over whether to risk more deaths to save the plunging economy.Speaking at the daily briefing in London on Sunday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson dismissed calls to spell out the exit strategy from coronavirus lockdown - despite claims ministers in England want schools to reopen after May .Mr Williamson told the daily Downing Street briefing he was sorry that children were having to suffer through the crisis but would not give a date for aof schools.Meanwhile, the Department of Education has not responded to a similar query over when schools here may reopen, or whether it has ruled out the possibility of pupils ing to classrooms before September.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Such a development would put the future viability of many pubs and restaurants in jeopardy.The Department of Health in the Republic confirmed on Sunday that  more people have died from Covid-, bringing the overall death toll there to .A further  new cases of the coronavirus have also been diagnosed, bringing the total number of cases to ,.Mr Harris praised the GAA for its actions regarding the virus but warned that it is unlikely there would be any major sporting events this year.It#s highly unlikely we#re going to be seeing very large kind of mass gatherings this year. Could you get to a point where you can#t have massive GAA matches, but you could have local kids having a kickabout safely, that#s the sort of space that we#re in, that we need to work our way through.The minister#s view that there is unlikely to be large mass gatherings before the end of the year places the most serious question marks yet over the GAA football, hurling and camogie championships, other sporting events and festivals and concerts such as Electric Picnic, which have become staple features in the Irish summer calendar.Schools in Denmark began to reopen last week with strict social-distancing rules in place, the first such development in Europe.Mr Harris#s comments raise the prospect that schools here could be partially reopened sooner rather than later. He said any easing of current restrictions, which are in effect until May , would be dependent on continued public compliance and the advice of public health officials.I#d like to see a situation whereby our schools could come back or at least could come partially back, he said, adding that this could happen for one day a week initially.I#d like to see a situation where you could expand somewhat the areas in which people can go beyond their home. I#m conscious of the fact that cocooning may well remain a reality for quite a period of time because we know people, once they reach a certain age, are vulnerable.But is there a safe way that they can get out every now and again and take a walk Mr Harris said social or physical distancing would be a reality until there was a vaccine or an effective treatment for the disease.What#s not going to come back quickly are scenarios in which we can#t safely socially distance, he said.So I can#t see how people can be in packed pubs again as long as this virus is still with us and we don#t have a vaccine or an effective treatment.Mr Harris also strongly defended the Government#s response to the spread of the virus in nursing homes.More than half of Covid- deaths in Ireland have been connected to these care facilities.Amid criticism from some doctors, the Opposition and Nursing Homes Ireland , the national representative body for the private and voluntary nursing home sector, Mr Harris said: If it#s a choice you#re presenting me between taking the view of a trade body [NHI] or a public health doctor on a global pandemic, I#m going to take the side of the public health doctor every single time.He said NHI is an excellent organisation but they#re not the public health experts.Mr Harris said he would have lots to say about the future of caring for the elderly when the pandemic was over and said a greater focus on community care would eventually render the current nursing home model out of date.He added: There#ll always be a place for it but positive ageing and respecting the dignity of older people will involve much more in the community rather than in any kind of building.Mr Harris#s comments come as it emerged that residential centres for people with disability were preparing for a surge of Covid- cases as clusters continue to multiply in nursing homes.Dr Joanne McCarthy, head of policy and research with the Disability Federation of Ireland, said the residential centres were behind nursing homes in terms of the spread of the infection. The disability sector is only going on that Covid- curve now.We#re hoping that because most people are living in smaller family units [rather than institutional settings], that might contain the spread, she said.A shortage of personal protective equipmentcontinues to worry staff in nursing homes, with more than a third now managing clusters of the virus. An internal memo circulated by Dr Colm Henry, clinical director of the HSE, advised nursing homes that reserves of gowns and face masks would become exhausted soon unless new supplies were secured.It advised staff not to wear gownsthey were at low risk of infection and that it may be necessary to prioritise the use of gowns and masks for certain high-risk work.Given the critical supply situation, the session may need to include care of patients with confirmed Covid- and those with suspect Covid-, the memo said.It continued that it was important to explore the possibility of using reusable cloth gowns which it advises,covered with a plastic apron, provide a substantial measure of protection.A separate memo, released on Saturday, revealed that nursing homes would be allowed to order PPE based on the number of confirmed or suspect cases of Covid- in their centres. The NHI said on Saturday that rationing personal protective equipment in older person#s facilities was not appropriate and flies in the face of previous commitments.Dr Henry said last Friday that although the HSE was in a very perilous state due to a lack of supply of gowns, the situation had been resolved for now.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cbf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eba-fe--ab-acbc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cbf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eba-fe--ab-acbc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cbf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eba-fe--ab-acbc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cbf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eba-fe--ab-acbc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cbf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eba-fe--ab-acbc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CoronavirusCoronavirus updates: One person dies and  new cases reportedOne person has died and  new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed since Saturday, Northern Ireland#s Public Health Agencyhas said. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ea .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cabeaa-a-db-be-edcdadaa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ea .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cabeaa-a-db-be-edcdadaa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ea .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cabeaa-a-db-be-edcdadaa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ea .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cabeaa-a-db-be-edcdadaa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ea .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cabeaa-a-db-be-edcdadaa_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland health department to consider PPE reuse advice in event of shortages The Department of Health in Northern Ireland has said it is not currently implementing new Public Health England advice to reuse personal protective equipmentbut that it will take national evidence into account in the event of shortages. Most ReadCoronavirus: Schools in Republic could soon open one day a week but All-Ireland championships in doubtFianna Fail and Fine Gael government pledge to set up #united island# unitVaradkar orders urgent review after fruit picker charter flight lands in IrelandLting restrictions will be ‘slow and controlled’, says Covid- advisory groupThree men to appear in court following altercation,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases. Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chandigarh in the Indore district of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalior. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chandigarh. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chandigarh in the Indore district of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalior. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chandigarh. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

To this day, the  All-Ireland winning team remains Derrys flagship group. The foundations were dug long before Anthony Tohill plucked both throw-ins in the lashing rain of Newry, that started the ball rolling towards Sam. This week Michael McMullan delves deeper, back to where it all began. On that famous September Sunday in , Seamus Downey nipped between Mark OConnor and John Kerins before fisting Damian Cassidys cross-shot to set off an explosion of red and white on Hill  behind. It was the final shudder Derry needed to wade clear of the early Cork storm and en their strides towards Sam Maguire. googletag.cmd.push Every dream begins somewhere. The s was greeted with a raft of MacRory and Hogan Cups, following on from St Pius Vocational Schools glory. Added in was an Ulster U title and four All-Ireland minor final appearances – producing two wins. It was a golden era that helped assemble the crux of a team that would dine at the top table for most of a decade. Tradition emerges in cycles. The s saw Derry seniors regularly at Croke Park. They lost a NFL final to the Dubs, won three Ulster senior titles, losing a further two finals. It was a team that Mick ODwyer termed the greatest team never to win footballs top prize. Their example, inspired the generation coming after them. googletag.cmd.push But Derrys waves of success had already begun. St Columbs Derry won the MacRory and Hogan Cup in , the same year Tommy Diamond captained the Oaks minor crop to the Tom Markham Cup. An All-Ireland U followed three years later. It was natural progression. This success, needed inspiration to come from somewhere. Its about having an example to follow. They needed the earliest pioneers to put Derry football on the map. *** According to Derry GAAs history book, produced in , the first official county board meeting took place in September . All six clubs present have since dissolved, but of the  present at the start of , only Claudy and Foreglen exist to this day. St Patricks Waterside are credited by the Derry People with having the first team to represent the county, when they played Strabane in a game at Lford. After nine attempts to get the GAA fully operational, in a period that saw Derry win two Ulster hurling championships and reach four football finals, it wasnt here to stay until . Ulster Council official Benny Fay, of Cavan, organised an exhibition game between Newbridge and Ballinderry. After the game, the county board was formed of  officials, two from each club. In May that year, Derry beat Antrim in the opening round of the Ulster junior championship, before beating Tyrone in the semi-final, but they lost to Donegal in the decider. Later, in , they entered the league but were defeated by Tyrone in their first game. It was the start. In  a new city board emerged and their secretary, Sean Dolan, later presided over a meeting in Claudy to elect a North Derry board. By , the county had entered its first minor team which would supply seven players to the senior team who began the building process. It also contained future GAA President Paddy McFlynn. It wasnt until the s that titles began to regularly arrive. It was a spell when Derry won the Ulster junior championship, the now defunct Dr Lagan Cup , the Dr McKenna Cup and pride of place - the  NFL title.   NFL Champions From that team, goalkeeper Charlie Moran, Sonny McCann, John Eddie Mullan, Mickey McNaught and Roddy Gribbin would form the spine of a team that took Derry into the next decade. They reached the league semi-final of , only to be narrowly beaten by All-Ireland champions Meath. The same year, a strong junior team lost to Mayo in the All-Ireland final and three years later, the seniors pushed a star-studded Cavan team all the way in a league game. The momentum was building with every passing year. In , Derry beat Armagh in the Dr McKenna Cup, just nine months after the Orchard side had contested an All-Ireland final with Kerry. Twelve months later, in , a win over Armagh would see Derry contest their first Ulster senior final since . No longer was the top level of provincial football a one-game season, before being knocked out on their ear. Derry were beginning to challenge. In the decider, they came up against a Cavan team in search of their th title. Derry had seven of the team that would play in their first ever All-Ireland senior final four years later. They gave the Breffni men all they wanted before going down - to -. The winners had Peter ODonohue to thank for his display of accuracy from frees. Derry were getting closer and closer. The  season ended with another appearance in the final, this time going down to Tyrone by two points. Their time was just around the corner. *** The  season was the best in Derrys history, at the time, but it began in the unfamiliar surroundings under the Twin Towers of Wembley Stadium. The British GAA rented the iconic venue to host a tournament, known as Wembley at Whit. It became a hit and lasted until the s. Derry took the field before Galway, in front of an attendance of ,, making them the first ever GAA team to step on the hallowed Wembley turf. The Tribesmen lted Sam two years earlier and ran out eight point winners over a Derry team on the rise. The  season saw Derry win both the Dr McKenna and the Dr Lagan Cups. It was on the championship stage where they laid their greatest stamp. Derry opened with a narrow three-point win over neighbours Antrim at Casement Park. It was all the more signicant, as the Oakleafers had to come from behind in the closing stages. It set up a clash with Cavan in the semi-final, who took three games to get over Monaghan. Derry started sluggishly against the Ulster kingpins before pulling away to book their place in the final. It was a novel pairing with Derry and Down both vying for a first title. It was manager Roddy Gribbins side who came out on the right side of the battle in Clones . The Ulster champions were now poised for an All-Ireland semi-final clash with Kerry. Before that, Derry played the Dr McKenna Cup final in early August, something that would be unheard of now. They hammered Armagh - to -. *** It set Derry up for the biggest game in their history. After years challenging at All-Ireland junior level, this was the pinnacle. And it was Kerry standing in their way. In their ranks were newcomers Mick ODwyer at wing back and Mick OConnell in attack. On a tricky day for football, the Kingdom began with the first of two Tadhgie Lyne goals and led - to -. By half-time it was a dferent story and Derry were two points ahead. The Oakleafers matched a fancied Kerry side every step of the way and went into a four point lead before Lyne grabbed a second goal to leave them holding on in the final moments to book their place in the final on a - to - scoreline. It was time to challenge for Sam. Derry were a young side, but benefited from the experience and nous of manager Roddy Gribbin, who would come on later in the final, to bring down the curtain on a  year senior career. The Dubs were primed after losing the  final to Kerry and nine of the starting team were back, including Kevin Heffernan, Paddy Haughey and ace free-taker Ollie Freaney. Dublin had the wind at their backs and attacked the Hill  end in the first half. Haugheys control on the ground set up Heffo for a point to settle down the home side. It took an angled kick from Brendan Murray to get the Oaks off the mark. But back came Dublin and led - to - at one point in the first half, with Freaney and John Timmons doing much of the damage. Derry began to find their feet, but were wasteful in front of goal. Up popped Dinny McKeever to notch their second point, before two Sean OConnell points had his side within a goal of the Dubs. The interval lead was - to -. OConnell was on target early in the second half, but Derry needed a Patsy Gormley save to deny full-forward Johnny Joyce.  The build-up to Owen Gribbins goal Another OConnell free had Derry back to within the kick of a ball. Then they were level. Twenty-five years before Downeys fisted goal, Derry were again attacking the Railway goals. Owen Gribbin did the spadework earlier in the move. Chuck Higgins and Brian Mullan went close in a goalmouth scramble before Owen Gribbin finished to the net. The sides were level - to -. They needed a break to swing their control into something that would ask questions of Dublin. Their brief glimmer of hope was quashed when Des Ferguson goaled for Dublin shortly after. The changing of the game as the introduction of Maurice Whelan to the Dublin defence, allowing Lar Foley to push towards midfield where he negated the influence of Jim McKeever. A second Dublin goal pushed the margin to eight points, but OConnell and Owen Gribbin, with a fisted effort, rounded off the scoring, but Dublin were - to - wi nners. McKeevers performances in the All-Ireland series saw him awarded the first Texaco award for player of the year. Later in the season, Derry completed the treble of Ulster titles by seeing off Donegal in the final of the Dr Lagan Cup. It couldve been a perfect season, but instead it laid the foundations for the success that followed.

It was a golden era that helped assemble the crux of a team that would dine at the top table for most of a decade. Tradition emerges in cycles. The s saw Derry seniors regularly at Croke Park. They lost a NFL final to the Dubs, won three Ulster senior titles, losing a further two finals. It was a team that Mick ODwyer termed the greatest team never to win footballs top prize. Their example, inspired the generation coming after them. googletag.cmd.push But Derrys waves of success had already begun. St Columbs Derry won the MacRory and Hogan Cup in , the same year Tommy Diamond captained the Oaks minor crop to the Tom Markham Cup. An All-Ireland U followed three years later. It was natural progression. This success, needed inspiration to come from somewhere. Its about having an example to follow. They needed the earliest pioneers to put Derry football on the map. *** According to Derry GAAs history book, produced in , the first official county board meeting took place in September . All six clubs present have since dissolved, but of the  present at the start of , only Claudy and Foreglen exist to this day. St Patricks Waterside are credited by the Derry People with having the first team to represent the county, when they played Strabane in a game at Lford. After nine attempts to get the GAA fully operational, in a period that saw Derry win two Ulster hurling championships and reach four football finals, it wasnt here to stay until . Ulster Council official Benny Fay, of Cavan, organised an exhibition game between Newbridge and Ballinderry. After the game, the county board was formed of  officials, two from each club. In May that year, Derry beat Antrim in the opening round of the Ulster junior championship, before beating Tyrone in the semi-final, but they lost to Donegal in the decider. Later, in , they entered the league but were defeated by Tyrone in their first game. It was the start. In  a new city board emerged and their secretary, Sean Dolan, later presided over a meeting in Claudy to elect a North Derry board. By , the county had entered its first minor team which would supply seven players to the senior team who began the building process. It also contained future GAA President Paddy McFlynn. It wasnt until the s that titles began to regularly arrive. It was a spell when Derry won the Ulster junior championship, the now defunct Dr Lagan Cup , the Dr McKenna Cup and pride of place - the  NFL title.   NFL Champions From that team, goalkeeper Charlie Moran, Sonny McCann, John Eddie Mullan, Mickey McNaught and Roddy Gribbin would form the spine of a team that took Derry into the next decade. They reached the league semi-final of , only to be narrowly beaten by All-Ireland champions Meath. The same year, a strong junior team lost to Mayo in the All-Ireland final and three years later, the seniors pushed a star-studded Cavan team all the way in a league game. The momentum was building with every passing year. In , Derry beat Armagh in the Dr McKenna Cup, just nine months after the Orchard side had contested an All-Ireland final with Kerry. Twelve months later, in , a win over Armagh would see Derry contest their first Ulster senior final since . No longer was the top level of provincial football a one-game season, before being knocked out on their ear. Derry were beginning to challenge. In the decider, they came up against a Cavan team in search of their th title. Derry had seven of the team that would play in their first ever All-Ireland senior final four years later. They gave the Breffni men all they wanted before going down - to -. The winners had Peter ODonohue to thank for his display of accuracy from frees. Derry were getting closer and closer. The  season ended with another appearance in the final, this time going down to Tyrone by two points. Their time was just around the corner. *** The  season was the best in Derrys history, at the time, but it began in the unfamiliar surroundings under the Twin Towers of Wembley Stadium. The British GAA rented the iconic venue to host a tournament, known as Wembley at Whit. It became a hit and lasted until the s. Derry took the field before Galway, in front of an attendance of ,, making them the first ever GAA team to step on the hallowed Wembley turf. The Tribesmen lted Sam two years earlier and ran out eight point winners over a Derry team on the rise. The  season saw Derry win both the Dr McKenna and the Dr Lagan Cups. It was on the championship stage where they laid their greatest stamp. Derry opened with a narrow three-point win over neighbours Antrim at Casement Park. It was all the more signicant, as the Oakleafers had to come from behind in the closing stages. It set up a clash with Cavan in the semi-final, who took three games to get over Monaghan. Derry started sluggishly against the Ulster kingpins before pulling away to book their place in the final. It was a novel pairing with Derry and Down both vying for a first title. It was manager Roddy Gribbins side who came out on the right side of the battle in Clones . The Ulster champions were now poised for an All-Ireland semi-final clash with Kerry. Before that, Derry played the Dr McKenna Cup final in early August, something that would be unheard of now. They hammered Armagh - to -. *** It set Derry up for the biggest game in their history. After years challenging at All-Ireland junior level, this was the pinnacle. And it was Kerry standing in their way. In their ranks were newcomers Mick ODwyer at wing back and Mick OConnell in attack. On a tricky day for football, the Kingdom began with the first of two Tadhgie Lyne goals and led - to -. By half-time it was a dferent story and Derry were two points ahead. The Oakleafers matched a fancied Kerry side every step of the way and went into a four point lead before Lyne grabbed a second goal to leave them holding on in the final moments to book their place in the final on a - to - scoreline. It was time to challenge for Sam. Derry were a young side, but benefited from the experience and nous of manager Roddy Gribbin, who would come on later in the final, to bring down the curtain on a  year senior career. The Dubs were primed after losing the  final to Kerry and nine of the starting team were back, including Kevin Heffernan, Paddy Haughey and ace free-taker Ollie Freaney. Dublin had the wind at their backs and attacked the Hill  end in the first half. Haugheys control on the ground set up Heffo for a point to settle down the home side. It took an angled kick from Brendan Murray to get the Oaks off the mark. But back came Dublin and led - to - at one point in the first half, with Freaney and John Timmons doing much of the damage. Derry began to find their feet, but were wasteful in front of goal. Up popped Dinny McKeever to notch their second point, before two Sean OConnell points had his side within a goal of the Dubs. The interval lead was - to -. OConnell was on target early in the second half, but Derry needed a Patsy Gormley save to deny full-forward Johnny Joyce.  The build-up to Owen Gribbins goal Another OConnell free had Derry back to within the kick of a ball. Then they were level. Twenty-five years before Downeys fisted goal, Derry were again attacking the Railway goals. Owen Gribbin did the spadework earlier in the move. Chuck Higgins and Brian Mullan went close in a goalmouth scramble before Owen Gribbin finished to the net. The sides were level - to -. They needed a break to swing their control into something that would ask questions of Dublin. Their brief glimmer of hope was quashed when Des Ferguson goaled for Dublin shortly after. The changing of the game as the introduction of Maurice Whelan to the Dublin defence, allowing Lar Foley to push towards midfield where he negated the influence of Jim McKeever. A second Dublin goal pushed the margin to eight points, but OConnell and Owen Gribbin, with a fisted effort, rounded off the scoring, but Dublin were - to - wi nners. McKeevers performances in the All-Ireland series saw him awarded the first Texaco award for player of the year. Later in the season, Derry completed the treble of Ulster titles by seeing off Donegal in the final of the Dr Lagan Cup. It couldve been a perfect season, but instead it laid the foundations for the success that followed.

To be honest though, it’s easy. Derry is, in fact, unique because there isn’t another club championship in Ireland that has hosted Enda Muldoon or Patsy Bradley. And when I saw that I’ve compiled a club All-Star team without Conleth Gilligan or Shane McGuigan or Benny Heron or Emmett McGuckin, I thought two things. One, I hate myself. And two, Derry club football is special. . Eoin Mailey After  seasons playing senior football with Ardmore, Eoin Mailey has always stood out as a man who could cut it at any level. It would be an insult to a goalkeeper of such calibre and experience for me to list out the qualities that made him a top class number one. Just know he has them all. googletag.cmd.push h. Oisiacuten Duffy At St. Columb’s College, Oisiacuten was a dogged defender who’d stick to his man and guarantee you that no forward being shadowed by him would enjoy his day. In the space of a couple of years, he went from being a brilliant corner back to a dominant central player, so inspiring and so important in defence and attack. . Brendan Rogers When was the last time a full back caused the opposition such panic and headaches in the build-up to big games  Brendan Rogers has shut down the best forwards in the country but he has also been one of Slaughtneil’s most valuable players in transition. When he pumps the afterburners, it’s like he’s gliding up pitch on a moped. googletag.cmd.push . Gareth McKinless McKinless is nearly sadistic with the pleasure he derives from crushing the best laid plans of an enthusiastic attacker. As far back as  when he was switched on to Michael Murphy in Omagh, he’s been an irreplaceable hammer in the Ballinderry arsenal, used wherever they’ve needed him to bring the pain. . Jimmy O’Connor When I was younger, I had this idea in my head that top football players without exception had to be six feet tall and weighing  stone. Then I got roasted by Jimmy O’Connor. And for over a decade, I’ve seen him terrorise junior and intermediate teams from wing back – and he was doing it before wing backs were supposed to. . Chrissy McKaigue Tireless, supremely intelligent and, most importantly, uncompromising. Slaughtneil took their championship tally from one to five in four years, winning three Ulster titles and winning the adoration of everyone in the nation. Chrissy McKaigue was the face of that revolution and he was the beating heart of it too. . Paul Cartin Legend has it that, on a calm and clear day on the River Foyle, you can still hear the faint echo of the whelps that followed Paul Cartin’s shoulder tackle on Joe Diver in the quarter-final in Celtic Park in . Banagher’s daring dreams might’ve been futile in the end, but stories will be told about Paul Cartin long after we forget who won and lost. . Patsy Bradley Remember Mary K Burke’s photo of Patsy Bradley flying horizontally above Ballinderry heads through the air to get a finger nail on the ball  Take that action, multiply it by  minutes and multiply that by  years and you’re not even close to Patsy Bradley yet. Heart, hands, hardcore athleticism. The best ball-winner, in the air and in defence. . Enda Muldoon For all the big moments, Enda Muldoon was orchestrating them. It was his back-spinned pass to Raymie Wilkinson that finally undid Banagher in . It was his telepathic diagonal ball for Collie Devlin that broke Slaughtneil. It was Muldoon in the sky, it was Muldoon taking hits to free others, it was even Muldoon at  controlling the play. It was always Muldoon. . Niall McNicholl Captained Castledawson to their first ever championship title in  and led them with utter distinction on their road to a another two. A player who always managed to find time on the ball and a player who always managed to get on the ball even with all the work he subjected himself to. . Chrissy Bradley They’re still researching how a man with so many target dots on his head can still find so much space and freedom. You don’t win four championships in succession without top class forwards and, as a scorer and as a playmaker, Sammy Bradley has been one of the best throughout Slaughtneil’s rise. . Sean Leo McGoldrick Sean Leo McGoldrick is just better than you or I at football. It’s just easy for him. Imagine how you see the game, on and off the ball, Sean Leo sees that same game in at least  per cent slower motion. He’s been unfalteringly exceptional for Eoghan Rua – as he was for Derry. . Lee Moore Lee Moore is one tough football player. He’s not a Fancy Dan corner forward who needs sunshine and hard ground to excel. He can win dirty ball , he can hold his own and no matter the day he’ll still be one of the most lethally accurate kickers of a ball you’ll see. . Colm McGoldrick I think I’ve played against Colm McGoldrick four times and, no exaggeration, I have never laid a hand on him. I’ve tried to tackle him, loads of times, but failed at every chance to even touch him. It’s freakish how powerful he is yet so evasive at the same time. The football he’s played for Eoghan Rua was at a standard that would’ve ripped inter-county defenders apart. . Eoin Bradley Throughout the first half of the decade, Eoin Bradley was showing in so many dferent games that he was one of the finest footballers in the land. Glenullin might not have enjoyed much success in that time but Bradley was unmarkable – at ,  or . It was carnage what he was doing to teams and almost poetic that he was fighting losing battles despite taking scalps all around him.

Jimmy O’Connor When I was younger, I had this idea in my head that top football players without exception had to be six feet tall and weighing  stone. Then I got roasted by Jimmy O’Connor. And for over a decade, I’ve seen him terrorise junior and intermediate teams from wing back – and he was doing it before wing backs were supposed to. . Chrissy McKaigue Tireless, supremely intelligent and, most importantly, uncompromising. Slaughtneil took their championship tally from one to five in four years, winning three Ulster titles and winning the adoration of everyone in the nation. Chrissy McKaigue was the face of that revolution and he was the beating heart of it too. . Paul Cartin Legend has it that, on a calm and clear day on the River Foyle, you can still hear the faint echo of the whelps that followed Paul Cartin’s shoulder tackle on Joe Diver in the quarter-final in Celtic Park in . Banagher’s daring dreams might’ve been futile in the end, but stories will be told about Paul Cartin long after we forget who won and lost. . Patsy Bradley Remember Mary K Burke’s photo of Patsy Bradley flying horizontally above Ballinderry heads through the air to get a finger nail on the ball  Take that action, multiply it by  minutes and multiply that by  years and you’re not even close to Patsy Bradley yet. Heart, hands, hardcore athleticism. The best ball-winner, in the air and in defence. . Enda Muldoon For all the big moments, Enda Muldoon was orchestrating them. It was his back-spinned pass to Raymie Wilkinson that finally undid Banagher in . It was his telepathic diagonal ball for Collie Devlin that broke Slaughtneil. It was Muldoon in the sky, it was Muldoon taking hits to free others, it was even Muldoon at  controlling the play. It was always Muldoon. . Niall McNicholl Captained Castledawson to their first ever championship title in  and led them with utter distinction on their road to a another two. A player who always managed to find time on the ball and a player who always managed to get on the ball even with all the work he subjected himself to. . Chrissy Bradley They’re still researching how a man with so many target dots on his head can still find so much space and freedom. You don’t win four championships in succession without top class forwards and, as a scorer and as a playmaker, Sammy Bradley has been one of the best throughout Slaughtneil’s rise. . Sean Leo McGoldrick Sean Leo McGoldrick is just better than you or I at football. It’s just easy for him. Imagine how you see the game, on and off the ball, Sean Leo sees that same game in at least  per cent slower motion. He’s been unfalteringly exceptional for Eoghan Rua – as he was for Derry. . Lee Moore Lee Moore is one tough football player. He’s not a Fancy Dan corner forward who needs sunshine and hard ground to excel. He can win dirty ball , he can hold his own and no matter the day he’ll still be one of the most lethally accurate kickers of a ball you’ll see. . Colm McGoldrick I think I’ve played against Colm McGoldrick four times and, no exaggeration, I have never laid a hand on him. I’ve tried to tackle him, loads of times, but failed at every chance to even touch him. It’s freakish how powerful he is yet so evasive at the same time. The football he’s played for Eoghan Rua was at a standard that would’ve ripped inter-county defenders apart. . Eoin Bradley Throughout the first half of the decade, Eoin Bradley was showing in so many dferent games that he was one of the finest footballers in the land. Glenullin might not have enjoyed much success in that time but Bradley was unmarkable – at ,  or . It was carnage what he was doing to teams and almost poetic that he was fighting losing battles despite taking scalps all around him.

Tomorrow marks the first anniversary of the death of the -year-old journalist in Creggan last April. Detectives from the PSNI’s Major Investigation Team investigating the murder of Lyra have issued an appeal ahead of the anniversary. The Senior Investigating Officer has sent letters to people living in Creggan directly appealing to them to think back to the tragic events of a year ago and bring any new information forward to police. Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy, who is leading the investigation, said: “On Saturday,  months will have passed since journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead during rioting at Fanad Drive in Creggan. googletag.cmd.push Sadly Lyra’s mum died very recently without seeing justice for her daughter. While this appeal for information is being distributed by the police, it is also a direct appeal from the McKee family for help in getting justice for Lyra. “The community as a whole was devastated by Lyra’s murder. Condemnation of her killing was unequivocal. That condemnation brought support for the community’s response from countries across the world.” In his letter sent to Creggan residents, Detective Superintendent Murphy said: “Since Lyra was killed, many of you may have spoken with my team of detectives. We have strived to conduct the investigation with sensitivity and care. My investigation is being carried out with the community and this has enabled us to gather important evidence which has resulted in one man being charged with Lyra’s murder and a second man being charged with offences connected to the rioting which preceded it. googletag.cmd.push “My sincere thanks go to all those who have helped to date. “However, these charges do not signy the end of the investigation. For the police service, me and my team of detectives it is only the beginning. A huge amount of work has been done and massive amounts of community help has enabled us to piece together the events of  April  and gain a clear understanding of the roles played by those who were involved. “Lyra’s murder was not committed in isolation, nor did it involve only one person. The events that led up to Lyra being shot, and the events afterwards, are equally important. I am asking the community to reach into its conscience and tell us what it knows. Lyra’s family cannot begin the grieving process without the information about Lyra’s murder that they deserve. Anybody in their position would want the same. “One year on, I am still seeking the evidence to bring every single person who was involved that night to justice. I cannot deliver that without you. Specically I want to: Gather mobile phone footage or photographs from anyone who was there that nightSpeak to anyone who was present and who can identy those involved in the disorderSpeak to anyone who can provide first-hand evidence relating to the events which preceded or followed Lyra’s murderRecover the gun that killed Lyra“We have made the public portal available again, so that you can contact us discreetly. Log ontohttps:mipp.police.ukfrom your mobile, tablet, laptop or other device. We do not need to keep your mobile phone or device – we are only interested in downloading the videos or images of that night. Please tell us what you know. If you want to speak to me directly, let me know via the MIPP application, email me atjason.murphy@psni.pnn.police.ukor ring me via . “The community response has been incredible so far, but I know that other information and material is out there. On Lyra’s first anniversary I want to re-state the commitment of the police service to work with you as we collectively seek to release communities from the influence of terrorists. “For the purposes of this investigation, I will offer anonymity to those who wish to talk to us. All I am looking for is a conversation. That’s it. I know that iniduals may be struggling with their conscience, either about footage they have or information they know. We can help with that. Talk to us. Ease your conscience and help us resolve a small part of the nightmare that the McKee family live through every single day.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Terence McMacken played in the first ever game, has been player of the year and now holds the position of club secretary. He spoke to Michael McMullan... Last September, a bumper attendance flocked to a packed Roe Park Hotel in Limavady to mark  years of Dungiven Celtic. A celebration of a story that evolved from early jottings in the late s, before the club stretched its wings to fly to the top of intermediate football by the early noughties. The thriving youth scene means Dungiven Celtic is here to stay. Its all thanks to the people involved, according to club stalwart and current secretary Terence McMacken, as he carries the baton held by his late father John Joe. googletag.cmd.push All-time leading goalscorer Seamus Harkin is now the club chairman. Every week, the club fields seven -a-side teams, now has added a snowballing girls soccer string to its bow - under the leadership of James Doran - and last year hosted almost  kids at their annual summer camp. Currently, like every sporting venue around the globe, their Ballyguddin home lies dormant. The lock-down has left the sporting landscape a deserted one. For Dungiven Celtic, its a pit stop on a race that began in June . “Back then, there was a lot of summer soccer played,”McMacken outlines. “We played summer cups and people who were enthusiastic about the game got involved. Every townland would have had a team.” googletag.cmd.push Feeny FC were in vogue, playing their games where Banaghers Fr McNally Park is now situated. Many players from the Dungiven area would have turned out for them. They had the makings of a decent side, but soon dissolved. Almost immediately, Dernaflaw Rovers sprung up, playing mainly in cup competitions before the realisation dawned of a hunger for more action in a more regular and organised format. There was the inkling to join the Derry and District Sunday morning leaguefor the start of the   season. “A meeting was called in Sam ODonnells house and that is how it started.” McMacken adds. “Sam had played on the Feeny team at the time.” And there it was, Dungiven Celtic was founded. *** With the clubs green and white hooped jerseys on order from Seamus Dorans sports shop in Dungiven, the club kicked off their existence in ODonnells red and white striped kit. By the end of that season, the club were in the green, white and black colours associated with the club to this very day. It all began with a trip to the Brandywell on Sunday, August ,  for the clubs first game, against Moville who were one of the Donegal teams in the DD league. Vinny Hargan scored a hat-trick in the - win. Between the posts was Dungiven and Derry Gaelic goalkeeper John Sommers. Also on the team were stalwarts Gerard Kelly and Terence McMacken. “We didnt really know what to expect,” McMacken recalls. “We had played in friendlies at the time, there was no real social media, so we thought this would be a good Moville team wed be playing against. “We played very well. We may have been a bit inconsistent, but we had a lot of good footballers around here and were better than we gave ourselves credit for.” By the end of , the club won their first trophy when they ed victorious from the Brandywell with the McKinney Cup thanks to two goals from Hugh Doherty. “We beat Brandywell Harpsin the final and they were the top team in the city at the time, so that was a big win,” McMacken adds. Saturday football then began, when the club entered a team into the North West senior league, with many of the players mixing it with a DD game on a Sunday, as well as playing Gaelic games. At the age of , Gerry McElhinney came to play for Dungiven Celtic. He would be waiting at Park bridge every Saturday where he would be collected for a game. By , he was an all-star Gaelic footballer with Derry and was playing on loan from Celtic at Finn Harps. “From Dungiven Celtic, Gerry moved to Distillery and was playing very well for them before being snapped up by Bolton Wanderers,” recalls McMacken. “I can alsoremember Anthony Tohillplaying for Park out at Ballyguddin on the Saturday before he went on trial at Manchester United.” By the end of the s, there was talk of a new Northern Ireland Intermediate league on the horizon. “It was for clubs who were quite ambitious,” McMacken begins. “The Irish league, at a higher level, was a closed shop. There were local clubs, who wanted to play at a higher level, but had no outlet. Some people in the club said well not and others wanted to give it a go and see where it goes.” It was the beginning of the climb. *** In August , Jack Doherty was Dungivens goalscorer in a - defeat to Cookstown United at the Curragh Road in the intermediate league cup. The next leg of the journey began. In the team was Scot Dougie Wood, who had spells with Sunderland and Raith Rovers, before moving to Ireland, where he won both league and cup honours with Derry City. “He came to us in his mid-s and was Dungiven Celtics player manager until he was around ,” McMacken states. The clubs longest serving manager Jim McGroarty then came on board. A Lettershandoney man, he played with Finn Harps before going over the water to Stoke City. After ato Ireland, he had a spell with Sligo Rovers before going back to the Harps. “When we won our first intermediate trophy , we beat Derry City in the final of the North West Challenge Cup,” McMacken adds. “Dougie had stepped down as manager, Jim was back playing for Sligo on a Sunday, so he took over as manager.” Another constant during that era was Martin Hazlett, who sadly passed away last year. Terence McMackens diligent record keeping charts Hazletts  appearances for the club. He played in the clubs first game at intermediate level, was player of the year in the  season and picked up the award for the sixth time, some  years later.  Martin Hazlett celebrates cup glory for Dungiven Was he the clubs greatest player  “There is no doubt about it, he was a wonderful player,” came McMackens prompt reply. “He always came to play a game properly prepared and he was always in good shape. He took his football seriously and I always thought he couldve played where – a higher level.” Hazlett was very much a home bird and lived beside the pitch, playing right up until the clubs golden era at the late s and was the glue to pull the team together until the younger crop game along. “We had always had decent teams, but theleague was of a very high standard. Quite a number of the teams, they had people getting paid and were professional teams. We were holding our own, but were never good enough to win it.” In the Irish Cup, the club had two impressive runs during the s. They reached the sixth round in the   season, before going down to Loughgall. Along the way, they defeated local rivals Limavady United. The following season, they took on Irish League champions Crusaders at Seaview, going down - after giving a good account of themselves. It helped keep the momentum going and after knocking on the door for a few years, Intermediate league success was to follow. *** In the beginning, Dungiven Celtic played their games between the county school, a pitch on the Hass Road and on the Garvagh Road, where Paacuteirc na nOacuteg Gaelic pitch is now situated. “The council bought a field up at the Curragh Road and it has been developed into the Sport Centre,” McMacken points out. “Then we moved to Ballyguddin. We rented it for years and we eventually bought it and developed it. It was a field with fencing around. In , they dug it up and made a pitch out of it.” Terences father, John Joe, had got involved in the club after ing from Belfast where he was working and supporting Belfast Celtic. He was following the Derry and Dungiven GAA teams, before being asked to get involved in Dungiven Celtic. “He played major role in the club from then on. He kept it going in bad times during the troubles, when it was tough going,” said Terence, who later wrote a poem as a tribute to his late father. “He didnt get to see the pitch finished. When they came into work on the pitch, he died a week after.” Terence now looks after the pitch. Seamus Harkin hails the endless hours he puts into it. “Youll probably find him out there any way, just making sure it is in pristine condition.” Dermott McCloskey was another who poured his le into the club after his playing days, whether it was coaching or whatever needed done. “Dermott was a big influence in procuring the pitch on a permanent basis and developing it,” McMacken adds. Another club stalwart remembered at the club dinner was Patsy Donaghy. Not many Dungiven Celtic players will remember him not being around the club during his letime. He famously reminded Gerard Kelly to stay on his feet. “Get up Kelly, you need studs on your arse,” he would say. “Patsy was a permanent fixture,” McMacken recalls. “He never played, but he was the club linesman – one of those guys. Every club has them...and the flag was pointing one way most of the time.” So many offered time over the years to take Dungiven Celtic from Sam McDonnells house to their new home at Ballyguddin, but by the early s the first team was really beginning to come of age. McMacken, who would rather be watching the local underage blossom than watching soccer on the telly, remembers being down at the pitch one Saturday as the they young guns began to filter into the first team. An onlooker expressed how well the team was playing. “Ill tell you what...youve a team there for  years,” McMacken was told. And so there was. Of the  players that formed the crux of that squad about  of them wouldve been there all the way through. For most of a decade. “You might have had the odd boy going away to England or America, but it was dferent times then – boys were there to train and to play,” McMacken added. “We had a lot of boys playing Gaelic and hurling, they mixed it up the best. All three codes were doing very well. “The fact it was a community thing means there were days when you had to do without guys, thats the way it has to be.” It brought McMacken to the story of a weekend when Dungiven Celtic were down to play an Irish Cup tie in Belfast against Donegal Celtic, on the same Saturday Dungivens Gaelic team were set to play Bellaghy. The Belfast club accepted the request for an earlier kick-off to accommodate five players to jump into a car and head to Bellaghy. “We won -, they were a really good team. It was an outstanding game and our boys were shattered after it,” said McMacken. Emmett McKeever was man of the match and was one of the players on their way to Bellaghy for part two of their super Saturday. Dungiven beat Bellaghy and later the that night, McMacken was informed that McKeever was the star of the show for the second time that day. “I didnt even know how he was able to walk again after the way he played. There was two games where he was man of the match in one day.” It was the   season when the breakthrough came with the clubs first intermediate League title. They lost only once, to Strabane, during their -game march to glory. They were - down in one game, away to Roe Valley, before Seamus Harkins hat-trick pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. Harkin bagged another two goals in another important clash, as Celtic saw off Dergview and they never looked back. The following season was an even better one, with all three teams – firsts, reserves and thirds – all winning their respective league titles. The firsts needed to avoid defeat in the final game of the season in a decider with Strabane, a game that ended scoreless, and Dungiven had retained their title. Six days later a - win over Park saw the reserves crowned champions and the thirds made it a clean sweep, but they did it the hard way. After going six games without a win, they won  of the remaining  games. The firsts added the intermediate challenge cup and the McGrogan Memorial Cup, to round off a season that brought five trophies. After the gap of a year, Dungiven came back to win their third Intermediate League title to cement it as the clubs most memorable period. Fast forward to the present day and the future looks equally rosy. In recent years, the club were honoured by the IFA as the Club of the Year. “Dungiven Celtic Football has consistently excelled in its work for youth football in the local area,” read part of the response from the judging . “The club’s community work has also been exemplary having successfully managed to build signicant participation in the local area.” After becoming an established club, the award rubber-stamps their commitment to the future “We have come a long way and it can fall apart very quickly,” is the take of Terence McMacken. “It is like any other club, it depends on the people. We are lucky at the moment, we have very good people involved. What we have....one, two or three people couldnt do.” He refers to the parental support and how the club is run very much on the GAA model, for the community and with everyone rowing in behind each other. McMacken refers to other clubs in Dungivens league paying their players, but he is adamant their way is the one that needs to remain. “Theyhave loyalty, that is the big thing. It is hard to get that in soccer. It is a dferent game, there are dferent rules and it is run dferently. “We are playing teams on Saturdays where players are getting paid, where our guys are putting in a fiver to play. It is a thing we think is right.” The money goes towards the running of the club and all the admin fees that are hidden from the eye of a player every Saturday. The underage players all contribute a pound, which helps towards the booking of training facilities. Other clubs have players getting offered money here and there with goal bonuses. “Then there are clubs, like ourselves, who arent. I wouldnt like to see it changed. You are asking them to be part of a club, to sell tickets or whatever, the same as the six-year-olds.” The balls might be flying around Ballyguddin before the season is out, but the chances are they wont as players are kept tucked up at home for the safety of the nation in the facing the coronavirus outbreak. When the action s, the surface will be like a carpet and there will be smiles on the kids faces as they mix with their peers once again. The meeting in Sean ODonnells house was only the beginning. The club has been passed on, with interest. Its in a healthy state. Heres to the next  years.

At the age of , Gerry McElhinney came to play for Dungiven Celtic. He would be waiting at Park bridge every Saturday where he would be collected for a game. By , he was an all-star Gaelic footballer with Derry and was playing on loan from Celtic at Finn Harps. “From Dungiven Celtic, Gerry moved to Distillery and was playing very well for them before being snapped up by Bolton Wanderers,” recalls McMacken. “I can alsoremember Anthony Tohillplaying for Park out at Ballyguddin on the Saturday before he went on trial at Manchester United.” By the end of the s, there was talk of a new Northern Ireland Intermediate league on the horizon. “It was for clubs who were quite ambitious,” McMacken begins. “The Irish league, at a higher level, was a closed shop. There were local clubs, who wanted to play at a higher level, but had no outlet. Some people in the club said well not and others wanted to give it a go and see where it goes.” It was the beginning of the climb. *** In August , Jack Doherty was Dungivens goalscorer in a - defeat to Cookstown United at the Curragh Road in the intermediate league cup. The next leg of the journey began. In the team was Scot Dougie Wood, who had spells with Sunderland and Raith Rovers, before moving to Ireland, where he won both league and cup honours with Derry City. “He came to us in his mid-s and was Dungiven Celtics player manager until he was around ,” McMacken states. The clubs longest serving manager Jim McGroarty then came on board. A Lettershandoney man, he played with Finn Harps before going over the water to Stoke City. After ato Ireland, he had a spell with Sligo Rovers before going back to the Harps. “When we won our first intermediate trophy , we beat Derry City in the final of the North West Challenge Cup,” McMacken adds. “Dougie had stepped down as manager, Jim was back playing for Sligo on a Sunday, so he took over as manager.” Another constant during that era was Martin Hazlett, who sadly passed away last year. Terence McMackens diligent record keeping charts Hazletts  appearances for the club. He played in the clubs first game at intermediate level, was player of the year in the  season and picked up the award for the sixth time, some  years later.  Martin Hazlett celebrates cup glory for Dungiven Was he the clubs greatest player  “There is no doubt about it, he was a wonderful player,” came McMackens prompt reply. “He always came to play a game properly prepared and he was always in good shape. He took his football seriously and I always thought he couldve played where – a higher level.” Hazlett was very much a home bird and lived beside the pitch, playing right up until the clubs golden era at the late s and was the glue to pull the team together until the younger crop game along. “We had always had decent teams, but theleague was of a very high standard. Quite a number of the teams, they had people getting paid and were professional teams. We were holding our own, but were never good enough to win it.” In the Irish Cup, the club had two impressive runs during the s. They reached the sixth round in the   season, before going down to Loughgall. Along the way, they defeated local rivals Limavady United. The following season, they took on Irish League champions Crusaders at Seaview, going down - after giving a good account of themselves. It helped keep the momentum going and after knocking on the door for a few years, Intermediate league success was to follow. *** In the beginning, Dungiven Celtic played their games between the county school, a pitch on the Hass Road and on the Garvagh Road, where Paacuteirc na nOacuteg Gaelic pitch is now situated. “The council bought a field up at the Curragh Road and it has been developed into the Sport Centre,” McMacken points out. “Then we moved to Ballyguddin. We rented it for years and we eventually bought it and developed it. It was a field with fencing around. In , they dug it up and made a pitch out of it.” Terences father, John Joe, had got involved in the club after ing from Belfast where he was working and supporting Belfast Celtic. He was following the Derry and Dungiven GAA teams, before being asked to get involved in Dungiven Celtic. “He played major role in the club from then on. He kept it going in bad times during the troubles, when it was tough going,” said Terence, who later wrote a poem as a tribute to his late father. “He didnt get to see the pitch finished. When they came into work on the pitch, he died a week after.” Terence now looks after the pitch. Seamus Harkin hails the endless hours he puts into it. “Youll probably find him out there any way, just making sure it is in pristine condition.” Dermott McCloskey was another who poured his le into the club after his playing days, whether it was coaching or whatever needed done. “Dermott was a big influence in procuring the pitch on a permanent basis and developing it,” McMacken adds. Another club stalwart remembered at the club dinner was Patsy Donaghy. Not many Dungiven Celtic players will remember him not being around the club during his letime. He famously reminded Gerard Kelly to stay on his feet. “Get up Kelly, you need studs on your arse,” he would say. “Patsy was a permanent fixture,” McMacken recalls. “He never played, but he was the club linesman – one of those guys. Every club has them...and the flag was pointing one way most of the time.” So many offered time over the years to take Dungiven Celtic from Sam McDonnells house to their new home at Ballyguddin, but by the early s the first team was really beginning to come of age. McMacken, who would rather be watching the local underage blossom than watching soccer on the telly, remembers being down at the pitch one Saturday as the they young guns began to filter into the first team. An onlooker expressed how well the team was playing. “Ill tell you what...youve a team there for  years,” McMacken was told. And so there was. Of the  players that formed the crux of that squad about  of them wouldve been there all the way through. For most of a decade. “You might have had the odd boy going away to England or America, but it was dferent times then – boys were there to train and to play,” McMacken added. “We had a lot of boys playing Gaelic and hurling, they mixed it up the best. All three codes were doing very well. “The fact it was a community thing means there were days when you had to do without guys, thats the way it has to be.” It brought McMacken to the story of a weekend when Dungiven Celtic were down to play an Irish Cup tie in Belfast against Donegal Celtic, on the same Saturday Dungivens Gaelic team were set to play Bellaghy. The Belfast club accepted the request for an earlier kick-off to accommodate five players to jump into a car and head to Bellaghy. “We won -, they were a really good team. It was an outstanding game and our boys were shattered after it,” said McMacken. Emmett McKeever was man of the match and was one of the players on their way to Bellaghy for part two of their super Saturday. Dungiven beat Bellaghy and later the that night, McMacken was informed that McKeever was the star of the show for the second time that day. “I didnt even know how he was able to walk again after the way he played. There was two games where he was man of the match in one day.” It was the   season when the breakthrough came with the clubs first intermediate League title. They lost only once, to Strabane, during their -game march to glory. They were - down in one game, away to Roe Valley, before Seamus Harkins hat-trick pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. Harkin bagged another two goals in another important clash, as Celtic saw off Dergview and they never looked back. The following season was an even better one, with all three teams – firsts, reserves and thirds – all winning their respective league titles. The firsts needed to avoid defeat in the final game of the season in a decider with Strabane, a game that ended scoreless, and Dungiven had retained their title. Six days later a - win over Park saw the reserves crowned champions and the thirds made it a clean sweep, but they did it the hard way. After going six games without a win, they won  of the remaining  games. The firsts added the intermediate challenge cup and the McGrogan Memorial Cup, to round off a season that brought five trophies. After the gap of a year, Dungiven came back to win their third Intermediate League title to cement it as the clubs most memorable period. Fast forward to the present day and the future looks equally rosy. In recent years, the club were honoured by the IFA as the Club of the Year. “Dungiven Celtic Football has consistently excelled in its work for youth football in the local area,” read part of the response from the judging . “The club’s community work has also been exemplary having successfully managed to build signicant participation in the local area.” After becoming an established club, the award rubber-stamps their commitment to the future “We have come a long way and it can fall apart very quickly,” is the take of Terence McMacken. “It is like any other club, it depends on the people. We are lucky at the moment, we have very good people involved. What we have....one, two or three people couldnt do.” He refers to the parental support and how the club is run very much on the GAA model, for the community and with everyone rowing in behind each other. McMacken refers to other clubs in Dungivens league paying their players, but he is adamant their way is the one that needs to remain. “Theyhave loyalty, that is the big thing. It is hard to get that in soccer. It is a dferent game, there are dferent rules and it is run dferently. “We are playing teams on Saturdays where players are getting paid, where our guys are putting in a fiver to play. It is a thing we think is right.” The money goes towards the running of the club and all the admin fees that are hidden from the eye of a player every Saturday. The underage players all contribute a pound, which helps towards the booking of training facilities. Other clubs have players getting offered money here and there with goal bonuses. “Then there are clubs, like ourselves, who arent. I wouldnt like to see it changed. You are asking them to be part of a club, to sell tickets or whatever, the same as the six-year-olds.” The balls might be flying around Ballyguddin before the season is out, but the chances are they wont as players are kept tucked up at home for the safety of the nation in the facing the coronavirus outbreak. When the action s, the surface will be like a carpet and there will be smiles on the kids faces as they mix with their peers once again. The meeting in Sean ODonnells house was only the beginning. The club has been passed on, with interest. Its in a healthy state. Heres to the next  years.

I liked the balance of having the occasional day at home and the rest of the week in the office.ldquoI think the boys are definitely happy at having mummy home all the time and we all are enjoying that but they miss their school friends.

O course Laffy was stabled at Major Corbettrsquos establishment prior to running in the Ulster National, being trained in England by Peter Cazalet.With no racing in Ireland or England at the present time, it is a good chance to do some reading and a book just recently published, The Story of Dundalk Stadium, is a must for local racing fans.As most people know Dundalk mdash always thought about as the third local track, despite being in Co Louth mdash holds some great memories for locals, too many to record here.A feature by Frankie Fitzsimons is most interesting and he recalls the day that his father and namesake, brother Brian and himself, all rose in the famous Sweet Afton Hunters Chase back in .Frankie senior finished fth on Royal Knight, now owned by Tom Kerr from Ballygowan, while Brian rode Satin Link, also owned by Kerr, whose colours were red with the initials THK on them. Frankie finished third on Bright Cottage in the colours of Brightrsquos Arnold Ennis, who at that stage was a farmer but later turned his farm into a popular golf club.The book records that Frankie senior won the Sweet Afton in  on Fort Wayne, trained by Major John Corbett at Tyrella. He also rode Copper Cottage, trained beside Downpatrick Racecourse by Ned Altern in . He also won the race in  on Copper Ridge, like Copper Cottage owned by Major T W Hughes, this one also trained by Ned Altern. This race was won in  by Frigid Fox, owned by S J Martin from Ballynahinch and ridden by his son Raymond.In later years this race became known as the Tallanstown Hunters Chase and was won by Bald Joker in the colours of Christine McBratney and ridden by her brother-in-law Colin, now a trainer at Crossgar.Frankie Fitzsimons junior rode a few winners under rules, but the one that he will always recall was when he rode Palo to victory in the opening hurdle race of the day at Dundalk in , the horse being owned by the well known busy draper, Downpatrickrsquos Joe Rea, and trained by Peter McGreevy.Back in  owner trainer Tom McConnell, from Carsonstown, near Saintfield, and Darragh Cross amateur Barney Jones recorded their first ever success when successful with loving star in the bumper race.Barney told me recently that on their way that day they collected a lot of bets to place on the horse and as his mouth got dry when he rode he was sucking a sweet that stuck to the roof of his mouth at the start.In  Farranfad farmer and horse breeder Brian Kennedy pulled off a   shock when he saddled Star of Venosos in his green and white belt colours to win the valuable CarrollHandicap Hurdle under Harry Rodgers, now a trainer.This was Brianrsquos first ever success as a trainer and although he only held a licence for a short time he also saddled his charge to win the Ulster Cesarewitch at   at Downpatrick when,memory serves me correctly, it was ridden by Ards jockey Philip Lowry.Lots of other names like Miss K R Payne, Leslie Crawford, Willie Rooney, Jeremy Maxwell, Sammy Shields, Robin Kidd and Pat McAteer feature in the book that brings back some great memories of a popular course, no longer the same to some of us..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

Clearly the vast majority of people heeded the advice they had been given, but there were a number of issues involving young people drinking together, the councillor continued.ldquoThe lsquostay at home messagersquo has got through but there is no room for complacency. We need to keep this up and while I appreciate that it is dficult and frustrating for many to stay at home and only venture outside for essential supplies, there will be light at the end of the tunnel.Cllr Clarke said while everyonersquos focus was on doing everything they could to stay safe, he believed that the pandemic will pass.ldquoWe all have a role to play to ensure that this happens as soon as possible, he said. ldquoPeople are yearning for ato normality, but we all need to play out part to ensure that this happens.Cllr Clarke said the impact of the lockdown was having a major impact on businesses in Newcastle who rely heavily upon tourism and who are suffering as a result of the current restrictions on businesses opening.ldquoBusiness has been devastated and I hope that those who have been forced to close will be provided with all the help and support they deserve moving forward, he continued.Cllr Clarke also praised all frontline NHS workers and Newry, Mourne and Down Council staff for continuing to deliver services in the face of the pandemic.He added: ldquoWe owe these people so much. They have stepped forward to help in their own respective fields and deserve our thanks.ldquoAll NHS staff have been fantastic as have local authority directors, who are working from home, and a number of other frontline staff.

Itrsquos a service he says he and his staff have been proud to offer.He has pupils whose parents are key NHS medics, including a couple who are both respiratory consultants, and knows the need to provide a place of shelter and safety for children of key workers is critical.ldquoEvenI had to keep the school open for one child of an NHS worker, it would be worth it, he said. ldquoMy head has said lsquoshut the schoolrsquo like the rest of them, but my heart says we are in this together and wersquove got to do our part.ldquoHowever, Irsquom not condemning any school who has closed as they have probably done so for the best of reasons.ldquoI sat in tears on Sunday evening as I didnrsquot know what I was doing was right in keeping the school open or not. We are one of the few schools offering cover for the weekends and all over Easter. Not one of my staff refused to come in to take a turn to keep the school open.ldquoIrsquove had  or more people offering to come in and help. Irsquove a great staff and they all pull together. At the end of the day, we have done our very best to safeguard the children and staff.Thankfully, Mr Moore has not received any reports of coronavirus amongst his pupils and staff, and he hopes that this status will continue.Known for not taking himself too seriously, Mr Moore has been entertaining and educating his pupils with hilarious Facebook videos of himself as educator turned entertainer. Using his considerable wit and cuddly toys as pretend schoolchildren, the principal of  years has taught mathematics, the importance of punctuation and much more over the last few weeks.He describes the incoming principal, Mr Fegan, as ldquoalmost like a son to me, and is equally proud of his other two former vice-principals, Mr Niall Stevenson and Mrs Lorna Stitt , who left the school to become principals of Downpatrick Primary School and Portavogie Primary School respectively.Mr Moore taught in primary schools in Belfast and Lisburn after he qualying in . He came to Academy as vice-principal in September  and taught a composite P-P class.He took over as principal from Mr George Smyth just five years later. The school at that time only had  children mdash it now has  children registered with double classes in all year groups and the nursery.ldquoI was appointed acting principal and Irsquove been acting principal ever since, quips Mr Moore.ldquoThe highlights for me have been many. Itrsquos been a honour not only to see children develop and flourish, but also my staff. Irsquom delighted with how my vice principals have gone on in their careers and that Mr Fegan has now been confirmed as the incoming principal after first coming here as a student teacher.ldquoIrsquove taken as much pleasure at seeing how some of my former pupils have fared in their careers and le as much as our AQE results, which are excellent. The school has also had three outstanding inspection reports in my time and apart from perhaps three rooms, the school has been completely refurbished.ldquoThe children are great ambassadors and a lot of them go on to to Down High School or Saintfield High School or Belfast grammar schools and quite often end up as head boy or head girl.His official send-off mdash a special assembly with an eveningat Temple Golf Club on June  mdash has been postponed.ldquoPersonally, itrsquos not ideal but there are people losing their lives, incomes, jobs, business are crashing, doctors and nurses putting their lives on the line, I will come back at a later stage and there will be a chance for everyone to say goodbye,said Mr Moore.ldquoTo be honest, Irsquom more upset for the Ps as most of them have been with us for eight years. Wersquove had to cancel going to Edinburgh, their leaving show which was going to be The Lion King in my honour.He said that his greatest delight at the school has been his pupils.ldquoThey are the main reason for my y tenure. It has been a joy to be their principal, he added.ldquoIt has also been an honour to have worked alongside the board of governors, both past and present, who have shared my vision for the school and supported me in its realisation.ldquoI am indebted in particular to the late Rev Alan Delamere, Mr David Donnan, Mr Geoffrey Perrin and currently Mr Peter Shaw for their leadership at the helm.ldquoThe current members of our teaching and non-teaching staff continue to reflect the professional dedication and loving care of their predecessors. I have been truly blessed to have a staff who have had a collective desire to put children first.Mr Moore also paid tribute to the parents and s for their ldquodaily partnership with the staff and your personal support to me as principal for over two decades.He and his we, Lynne, who live in Saintfield, share five children together and he says retirement will bring him a chance for them both to travel ndash when the travel ban is lted ndash and for him to devote more time to his beloved sports mdash hersquos a major football and rugby fan.He has been approached to do some educational consultancy work when he is officially retired but is happy to limit that to just several days a week.Mr Moore added: ldquoI can honestly say that during my time at Academy I have never wished that I had been a school leader anywhere  or that I was employed in an alternative profession.ldquoI will definitely shed a tear or two when I go. They will get over me, of course, as nobody is irreplaceable, but I will certainly miss the children and staff. I will not miss the responsibility of the day to day running of the place, but Irsquom a social animal and I will really miss everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Legacy.jpg","title":"The legacy of John de Courcy  ","story":"THE story starts in  when the Norman soldier-adventurer, Sir John de Courcy, went north from Dublin, the headquarters of Norman power in Ireland, and arrived at Downpatrick on February .De Courcy was a man of great physical strength and size. He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor. Chambers and passages were constructed along with a staircase rising to the walk wall.For over two centuries from  the history of the castle is barely documented. It appears that the Magennises seized Dundrum sometime in the th century and held it intermittently until it was surrendered to the Crown by Phelim Magennis in . The Savages appear to have been the owners when the Earl of Kildare took it in .The castle was granted to Lord Cromwell in , then sold in  by his grandson, the first earl of Ardglass, to Sir Francis Blundell.During the rising of  the Magennises retrieved the castle, but it was recaptured by the Parliamentarians, who partly demolished it in . By  the castle and grounds were placed into state care.Perhaps more than anywhere  in Ireland, Dundrum reflects the Anglo-Irish spirit ndash the work of the great de Courcy, the soldier-knight adventurer. Today Dundrum Castle is a ruin. De Courcyrsquos other achievement in Ulster, Carrickfergus Castle, is the best preserved Norman castle in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 When.jpg","title":"When Stirling Moss came to Downpatrick  ","story":"A RETIRED Downpatrick motor dealer has expressed his ldquotremendous sadness at the death of Sir Stirling Moss at the weekend.The motor racing legend, who was , was the guest of honour at the opening of Mr Billy McCormickrsquos refurbished Black and White garage in .It was a major event in the town and there were hundreds of people outside the newly renovated premises in Church Street, all eager to get a glimpse of one of the worldrsquos top sports stars.Mr McCormick has fond memories of the occasion. ldquoIt was a big day in every sense.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with.

This includes the use of PPE and, in-line with other providers of care, including the NHS, we have amended our visiting rules at the hospice.ldquoWith regards PPE, unfortunately, our hospice and community nursing service have been facing the same issues as the NHS in terms of getting all the equipment they need. We are screening patients with a phone call before attending their homes and staff will wear the appropriate PPE equipment during every household visit. However, we can only do this when we have the right PPE equipment available and are grateful to have recently received support from our colleagues at the Cardf and the Vale University Health Board to gain access to some PPE through their supply, for which we give our thanks.ldquoHowever we are always in need of more supplies to continue to provide vital end of le care to people living with a terminal illness, especially at this dficult time. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.
