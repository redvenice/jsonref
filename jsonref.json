Her father was a member of the Holy See police force. Rome\u0027s chief prosecutor has been called in to investigate the find.  One theory suggests she was kidnapped by hostage-takers trying to have Mehmet Ali Agca, who shot the Pope in St Peter\u0027s Square in 1981, freed from prison.Shortly after she disappeared the police are claimed to have received anonymous calls, which said Emanuela would be freed if the Turkish gunman was released. Forensic investigators are working to determine the age of the bones as well as the date of death.The Rome embassy is in the upscale residential neighborhood of Parioli, near the city\u0027s Villa Borghese museum.      Protesters  hold posters with Emanuela Orlandi\u0027s image calling for \u0027truth and justice\u0027 for the 15-year-old who vanished in 1983, in a demonstration in St Peter\u0027s Square in 2012The last major twist in the case came in 2012, when forensic police exhumed the body of a reputed mobster from the crypt of a Roman basilica in hopes of finding Emanuela\u0027s remains too. However, that search turned up no link.More recently, a leading Italian investigative journalist caused a sensation when he published a five-page document last year that had been stolen from a locked Vatican cabinet that suggested the Holy See had been involved in Orlandi\u0027s disappearance. The Vatican immediately branded the document a fake, though it never explained what it was doing in the Vatican cabinet.The document was purportedly written by a cardinal and listed supposed expenses used for Orlandi\u0027s upkeep after she disappeared. The Vatican has repeatedly maintained that it has co-operated fully with police investigating the Orlandi case.Vatican Orlandi mystery: \u0027Woman\u0027s bones\u0027 found in Rome search - BBC News"},{"url":null,"title":"Celebrities including Seth Meyers Mindy Kaling Reese Witherspoon Voted stickers","story":"    Beyonce revealed who she was voting for, Beto O\u0027Rourke for Texas Senator, in a post on Twitter          Kim Kardashian West showed off her \u0027I voted\u0027 sticker in a selfie she posted on Twitter, before sharing a picture of son Saint on Instagram with the caption: I voted today for my baby right here and his future\u0027          Heartthrob actor and singer Joe Jonas shared a selife of him wearing his sticker with the caption \u0027I voted\u0027          Celebrities are sharing post-voting selfies on social media to remind fans to go to the polls today.

If they did, Hillary would be PresidentSo my advice to the Democrats is to ditch the celebrities.And yes, of course I realise there is a humongous irony in saying this because Trump himself is himself a celebrity. In fact, he’s the biggest celebrity in the world.But Trump achieved his fame by being a ruthless, hardnosed businessman and that’s both how he won the presidency and how he is now running the country.His business experience makes him a very capable and dangerous competitor, communicator and campaigner.His star power from The Apprentice enables him to suck up TV oxygen like nobody else in political history.And for a guy in his 70s, he has incredible energy and stamina.So the Democrats are facing a quite unique opponent.To take him on, the party needs a winning new message and someone who can deliver it in the same clear, repetitive and hugely effective way that Trump delivers his.And I don’t see any sign of either of those things yet.Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016 by saying he was going to Make America Great Again.He’s pursued that goal in the most polarising, controversial, and often highly offensive manner imaginable.Some of his bull-in-a-china-store style has undeniably worked, especially his aggressive tax cuts and slashing of regulations that have sent the economy surging and been great for jobs.Some of it has been deeply unedifying, not least his dog whistle rhetoric about immigration.But whatever you think of Trump, these midterm election results prove that many tens of millions of Americans are buying into his mission and don’t think he’s doing too badly.If the Democrats are to have any hope of beating him in 2020, then they have got to come up with a better plan than screaming ‘Trump’s a monster’ or ‘Oprah and Taylor say don’t vote for Trump’.          Some of his bull-in-a-china-store style has undeniably worked, but I was pleased to see President Trump strike a more bi-partisan tone at his presser todayI was pleased to see President Trump strike a more bi-partisan tone at his presser today. He has a chance now to pivot to a more inclusive style of leadership and I hope he takes it.I also hope he and the media, especially my old employers at CNN, stop their mutually self-serving but increasingly embarrassing public feuding that is now turning their pressers like today into increasingly absurd WWE-style extravaganzas. But make no mistake: he won the midterms.If the Democrats can’t see that, or accept it, then Trump won’t just win again in 2020, he will drown them with his own brutal, uncompromising red tsunami. "},{"url":null,"title":"As Charles turns 70 work continues Royal Navys new aircraft carrier named heir throne","story":"    The 65,000-ton behemoth has been taking shape at Rosyth Dockyard in Fife (pictured) over the past four years and today the latest on construction was made public with new images          A workman walks across the ramp area of the flight deck during a tour of the under-construction aircraft carrier, HMS Prince of Wales.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Sometimes good books can be found in unusual places, as tommydog shows:I was up in the mountains fishing and on the cabin’s bookshelf was We Pointed Them North: Recollections of a Cow Puncher by EOC Abbott, aka Teddy Blue Abbott. It turned out to be a fun read and rather interesting. A friend, Helena Smith, basically wrote the book from Teddy’s dictation, poor grammar and all. He wanted to set the record straight in the late 1930s that while life on the post Civil War frontier was hard, it was also a lot of fun…It was a fun book, ideally suited to nights in a mountain cabin. In some of it you can see the source of countless western themes. Other aspects of life on the 19th century ranches are surprising (roller skating for example).Astonishing. Just in case you were wondering, here’s a definition of “cowpuncher”. (It isn’t someone who goes around thumping cows.)On the subject of frontiers, Dennis89 has been “thoroughly enjoying” The Worst Journey in the World by Apsley Cherry-Garrard:A monumental account of Scott’s tragic 1912 expedition to the South Pole. Since starting this book I feel that my concentration at work has waned... My thoughts keep ferrying me off to the wonder, beauty and isolation of Antarctica. I walk home from work eager to get back into that world of crevasses, comradeship, endeavour and altruism. Yes, there are the formidable details of the journeys undertaken and the conditions experienced but the real joy lies within the description of the human relationships that are formed in such a hostile and unforgiving environment.But humans aren’t always so noble. William Golding’s Lord Of The Flies has brought back memories for quickspace:Just read Lord of the Flies for the first time, finishing it yesterday with the horror of boyhood re-emerging 41 years later, the panic and cruelty boys inflict on each other. Having gone to an all boys school after flunking my 11+, the hierarchy and mob mentality felt familiar, though I don’t think anyone was brutally murdered by a mob or had their brains bashed out by a fuck-off rock. Oddly, the description of Simon’s corpse reminded me the description of Curly’s wife after her death in Of Mice ... At least in tone, curiously poetic and so sad I bawled my eyes out, which I’m glad happened now and not in my school days.The Portable Dorothy Parker, “a collection of her short stories, poems, reviews and personal correspondence” has impressed JohnHunt:Everything in the book is short, though the book itself runs to just over 600 pages … Like Runyon, Parker is very much of time and place and, again like Runyon, the time runs from the 1920s to the early 1950s and the place is New York and its environs. Parker knows her characters and she’s betting that you have a passing familiarity with them as well. Her stories are told from an unapologetically female perspective, often a woman’s internal dialogue. If you appreciate a good zinger at the end, if you need someone who’s quotes you will be able to recall at just the right moments, if you are looking for a good laugh or a way to consider the female perspective from her time period, Parker is your sure guide.Parker also wrote A Star Is Born if you’re wondering if she is still relevant today. You just can’t go wrong.Anna Burns’ Milkman has worked for chasm:I’m surprised by the reviews that described it as a difficult read, I thought it pretty accessible. I also thought it the best Booker winner for some years, original, thought-provoking, humane, and unputdownable.Meanwhile, jinxsboy51 recommends The Butchering Art: Joseph Lister’s Quest to Transform the Grisly World of Victorian Medicine by Lindsey Fitzharris:Very readable history of the transformation that occurred in medicine about the role of infection and sterilisation in making a big difference in surgery survival rates. NOT for the those with queasy stomachs.Finally, talking of stomachs, annegeraldine has been focussing on Thackeray’s Vanity Fair:The men have gone off to battle in Waterloo leaving Amelia a pitiful wreck and Becky planning her strategy should she be widowed. Joseph Sedley remains with the women: “At half-past two, an event occurred of daily importance to Mr Joseph -- the dinner-hour arrived.

Its clothing arm had an “ageing” customer base and dated stores, while its food halls were too expensive, with shoppers put off by “confusing” promotions.“Against the background of profound structural change in our industry, we are leaving no stone unturned,” said Rowe. “Every aspect of our ranges – how we trade, our supply chain and marketing – is undergoing scrutiny and change. We’re going bloody fast, trust me.”The profit figure was depressed by nearly £100m of one-off costs, around half of which related to the store closures. A further £11.1m covered a round of management job cuts as the retailer tackled a corporate culture that was “siloed, slow and hierarchical”.In the absence of obvious signs of recovery, Archie Norman, the turnaround expert who took over as chairman a year ago, insisted that M\u0026ampS was a business where “things are really beginning to happen”, with the figures “roughly what we expected them to be”.Gourmet Burger Kitchen: The upmarket burger chain wants to close 17 of its 85 restaurants via an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) House of Fraser:\u0026nbspThe department store chain is expected to close about 12 stores after being bought out of administration by Mike Ashley.

The groups lenders have since bought the 16 Gaucho outlets.Mothercare: The chain is closing 60 of its 137 outlets after agreeing a CVA in May. Additional closures in July mean 900 jobs will be lost.Carluccio\u0027s: The Italian chain secured a CVA to close 30 of its 99 restaurants in late May.New Look: The chain is closing 85 stores in a restructuring plan announced earlier this year. Its chairman, Alistair McGeorge, said the future of a further 39 stores was in doubt as talks with landlords continued.Carpetright: The retailer obtained a CVA in April to close 92 of its 409 UK stores in September with the loss of about 300 jobs.Prezzo: In March the Italian-themed restaurant group secured a CVA to close 94 of its 300 restaurants, with the loss of 500 jobs. Rent cuts were agreed on a further 57 locations.Jamie’s Italian: The chain closed six locations in 2017 and this year agreed a CVA to close about a third of its 35 loss-making outlets.Byron: The upmarket burger chain is closing up to 20 of its 67 restaurants after a CVA agreed in January.Debenhams: The under-pressure department store chain has said it could close up to 50 of its 165 stores stores and wants to get rid of space at 30 more by bringing in gyms and other services.M\u0026ampS: The high street stalwart wants to close 100 outlets – a third of its main stores by 2022 as part of a \u0027radical transformation\u0027 plan.Next season M\u0026ampS will buy more dresses and trousers in sizes eight through to 14, but fewer in a 16 and above, in a bid to improve stocks, he said.M\u0026ampS did not rule out further store closures as about third of the retailer’s 1,029 stores date from before the second world war and some are located on ailing high streets. Rowe said: “We won’t pause at 100. We have got to make sure that M\u0026ampS is relevant and fit for the future.”The retailer is also weighing up redevelopment options for another 80 of its older stores, some of which are freehold sites.It wants more families to shop regularly in its supermarkets, and its new food boss, Stuart Machin, is introducing bigger packs while lowering the prices of popular foods such as whole chickens and hamburgers to make them more affordable. Tom Stevenson of Fidelity Personal Investing said: “Reading through M\u0026ampS’s results is like taking a cold shower. The company is ruthlessly honest about the massive challenge it faces. Sales are still declining, in the context of which flat profits is not a bad result.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34923609cbf483ae9a3a87c4ce657cd291793a54/69_0_3361_2017/master/3361.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3e6359271739aeb3247baf950600631","title":"ryanair sacks six cabin crew after staged photo sleeping on malaga airport floor","story":"The staff members involved were moved to a VIP lounge in Malaga airport, the airline saysRyanair has sacked six cabin crew staff after they allegedly staged a photo showing themselves sleeping on an airport floor.The staff were accused of gross misconduct in creating the photo, which was shared widely on various social media platforms, as well as being reported by major news outlets across the world.However, the budget airline later published a video from security cameras allegedly showing the crew moving to a corner of the crew room away from where they were originally sitting and lying down. One crew member then appears to take a photograph.The crew was grounded in the early hours of 13 October in Malaga airport, on the south coast of Spain, because of storms in the Portuguese city, Porto.Ryanair claimed there were no hotel rooms in Malaga available for staff because of the Hiic Day national holiday, which falls on 12 October. Ryanair said its crew were in the crew room for “a short period of time” before moving to a VIP lounge in the airport. They returned to Porto the next day, and did not work on the flight back.Airline cabin crew are entitled to “adequate” rest before and during shifts, although the extent of rest required is often a point of contention between airlines and staff.Ryanair has faced significant issues with staff strikes. The Irish airline has officially recognised multiple European unions over the course of this year in a bid to improve relations.A Ryanair spokesperson said: “All six cabin crew members in Porto were dismissed on Monday 5 November for breach of contract on grounds of gross misconduct, after staging a fake photograph to support a false claim (widely reported in international media outlets) that they were ‘forced to sleep on the floor’ of the Malaga crew room.”The airline described the photo as “behaviour which damaged their employer’s reputation and caused an irreparable breach of trust with these six persons”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b05823ff2f3eba06d02f957aa9d75546a63ae2/0_76_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97deb8fae14753c70949cd546b673f03","title":"urban mountains shenzhens green rooftop project in pictures","story":"The Chinese megacity of 12 million people is crowded, polluted, and vulnerable to flooding.

It is more serious still when the BBC does it, and yet worse when the presenter is “the most trusted man in Britain”. But, as his latest interview with the Observer reveals, David Attenborough sticks to his line that fully representing environmental issues is a “turn-off”.His new series, Dynasties, will mention the pressures affecting wildlife, but Attenborough makes it clear that it will play them down. To do otherwise, he suggests, would be “proselytising” and “alarmist”. His series will be “a great relief from the political landscape which otherwise dominates our thoughts”. In light of the astonishing rate of collapse of the animal populations he features, alongside most of the rest of the world’s living systems – and when broadcasting as a whole has disgracefully failed to represent such truths – I don’t think such escapism is appropriate or justifiable.It is not proselytising or alarmist to tell us the raw truth about what is happening to the world, however much it might discomfit us. Nor do I believe that revealing the marvels of nature automatically translates into environmental action, as the executive producer of Dynasties claims. I’ve come to believe it can have the opposite effect.For many years, wildlife film-making has presented a pristine living world. It has created an impression of security and abundance, even in places afflicted by cascading ecological collapse. The cameras reassure us that there are vast tracts of wilderness in which wildlife continues to thrive. They cultivate complacency, not action.You cannot do such a thing passively. Wildlife film-makers I know tell me that the effort to portray what looks like an untouched ecosystem becomes harder every year. They have to choose their camera angles ever more carefully to exclude the evidence of destruction, travel further to find the Edens they depict. They know – and many feel deeply uncomfortable about it – that they are telling a false story, creating a fairytale world that persuades us all is well, in the midst of an existential crisis. While many people, thanks in large part to David Attenborough, are now quite well informed about wildlife, we remain astonishingly ignorant about what is happening to it.What makes Attenborough’s comments particularly odd is that they come just a year after the final episode of his Blue Planet II series triggered a massive effort to reduce plastic pollution. Though the programme made a complete dog’s breakfast of the issue, the response demonstrated a vast public appetite for information about the environmental crisis, and an urgent desire to act on it.Since 1985, when I worked in the department that has made most of his programmes, I have pressed the BBC to reveal environmental realities, often with dismal results. In 1995 I spent several months with a producer, developing a novel and imaginative proposal for an environmental series. The producer returned from his meeting with the channel controller in a state of shock. “He just looked at the title and asked ‘Is this environment?’ I said yes. He said, ‘I’ve spent two years trying to get environment off this fucking channel. Why the fuck are you bringing me environment?’”I later discovered that this response was typical. The controllers weren’t indifferent. They were actively hostile. If you ask me whether the BBC or ExxonMobil has done more to frustrate environmental action in this country, I would say the BBC.We all knew that only one person had the power to break this dam. For decades David Attenborough, a former channel controller widely seen as the living embodiment of the BBC, has been able to make any programme he wants. So where, we kept asking, was he? At last, in 2000, he presented an environmental series: State of the Planet.It was an interesting and watchable series, but it left us with nowhere to go and nothing to do. Only in the last few seconds of the final episode was there a hint that structural forces might be at play: “Real success can only come if there’s a change in our societies, in our economics and in our politics.” But what change? What economics? What politics? He had given us no clues.To make matters worse, it was sandwiched between further programmes of his about the wonders of nature, which created a strong impression of robust planetary health. He might have been describing two different worlds. Six years later he made another environmental series, The Truth About Climate Change. And this, in my view, was a total disaster.It told us nothing about the driving forces behind climate breakdown. The only mention of fossil fuel companies was as part of the solution: “The people who extract fossil fuels like oil and gas have now come up with a way to put carbon dioxide back underground.” Apart from the general “we”, the only distinct force identified as responsible was the “1.3 billion Chinese”. That a large proportion of Chinese emissions are caused by manufacturing goods the west buys was not mentioned. The series immediately triggered a new form of climate denial: I was bombarded with people telling me there was no point in taking action in Britain because the Chinese were killing the planet.If Attenborough’s environmentalism has a coherent theme, it is shifting the blame from powerful forces on to either society in general or the poor and weak. Sometimes it becomes pretty dark. In 2013 he told the  “What are all these famines in Ethiopia? What are they about? They’re about too many people for too little land … We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of flour. That’s barmy.”There had not been a famine in Ethiopia for 28 years, and the last one was caused not by an absolute food shortage but by civil war and government policies. His suggestion that food relief is counter-productive suggests he has read nothing on the subject since Thomas Malthus’s essay in 1798. But, cruel and ignorant as these comments were, they were more or less cost-free. By contrast, you do not remain a national treasure by upsetting powerful vested interests: look at the flak the outspoken wildlife and environmental presenter Chris Packham attracts for standing up to the hunting lobby.I have always been entranced by Attenborough’s wildlife programmes, but astonished by his consistent failure to mount a coherent, truthful and effective defence of the living world he loves. His revelation of the wonders of nature has been a great public service. But withholding the knowledge we need to defend it is, I believe, a grave disservice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b698e34708501f897ec4882dacac1b3481d1945f/0_91_2314_1388/master/2314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44364e2d155175bc04f9c2ca40112d3a","title":"gammon playground insult words of 2018","story":"An epithet for angry old white men has been named one of the words of 2018. That doesn’t say much for our political discourseGammon has been named one of the Collins dictionary’s words of the year. Not because we’re finally celebrating the underdog of all Christmas meats, but because of its place in the politically charged debate around Brexit, in which it is used to describe angry, middle-aged, white Brexiteers – presumably made red in the face by all their fury, bigotry and nationalism.It’s been greeted by some as a natural bedfellow for other words on the surprisingly “woke” list – which also includes gaslighting, #MeToo and single-use. When “identity politics” is dismissed to belittle minorities for caring about who they are, I can see why people are happy to have a word that mocks the majority for being passionate about their identities too.A system that will come into effect if no other arrangement is made (noun)A dance in which people twist their hips in one direction while swinging their arms in the opposite direction with the fists closed (noun)A person, typically male, middle-aged, and white, with reactionary views, especially one who supports the withdrawal of Britain from the European Union (noun)To attempt to manipulate (a person) by continually presenting them with false information until they doubt their sanity (verb)Denoting a cultural movement that seeks to expose and eradicate predatory sexual behaviour, especially in the workplace (adjective)A recreational activity, originating in Sweden, that combines jogging with picking up litter (noun)Made to be used once only (adjective)Abbreviation for video assistant refereeA person who refrains from using any animal product whatever for food, clothing, or any other purpose (noun)To cast a white actor in the role of (a character from a minority ethnic group) or to produce (a film or play) using white actors to play characters from a minority ethnic group (verb) But make no mistake: this is a celebration of oneupmanship, not of a word that meaningfully changes the discourse. By praising it, are we ignoring some of its problematic connotations?Calling people gammons invokes the image of an emotionally charged Brexit-voting contingent, who don’t think with their heads. It reeks of intellectual snobbery. Mocking people for having feelings. They are the pigs, we are the people – the people who deserve a people’s vote. It’s that old idea of the feckless masses, who need to be governed by an intellectual elite who really knows what’s best for them – it in fact gives credence to the idea that identity politics is unimportant because it’s just about protecting people’s feelings. It’s not. Identity politics is marginalised people fighting back and showing that we have a right to be heard, to be represented by people who look and think like us.While some object that it’s racist – something the dictionary was keen not to be drawn on – that’s neither true, nor the point. Racist words (which do appear in dictionaries, by the way) have the pull of broader injustices and systems of control behind them. They are hurtful because they remind someone of their place in the world. Calling someone a gammon doesn’t remind white people of how they suffer on the basis of their country of birth or religion. It doesn’t remind them of the mass incarceration of their people or how they will be denied access to equal pay and employment because of the colour of their skin. But just because it’s not racist, that does not make it a useful addition to the conversation around identity and politics. Racialised words can be used to push the debate forward. Using “white people”, for example, has made the white majority in this country, whose actions are not often attributed to their race, think about what it feels like when the shoe is on the other foot. It reminds us that not only black and brown people make decisions based on the colour of their skin. In contrast, gammon is a playground insult. Employing it draws attention from the real culprits – the many Brexiteers who aren’t “ham-egg-and-chips-loving, trashy-tabloid-reading proles”, but are in fact incredibly privileged people, such as Nigel Farage, Arron Banks and Boris Johnson, who hoped to make a profit out of Brexit, political or otherwise.Calling someone a gammon might give a maligned group a momentary feeling of power – now all of us can make fun of someone on the basis of how they look and who that makes them. But the fact that we’re fighting on that ground in the first place is depressing. Politics is personal. Sometimes it gets nasty. Sometimes it gets funny. But let’s not confuse slinging better insults at one another as the pinnacle of political debate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f783b6410f23ae902c03941ac936a9a3e90bcae/0_135_4389_2633/master/4389.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbcd8725ede8bf336067e13c832577a2","title":"the guardian view on the us midterms a welcome start","story":"The Democrats’ advances were essential and will check Donald Trump’s power, but disappointments show how far there is to go. Meanwhile, the Russia investigation must be protectedThe Democrats’ seizure of the House of Representatives and other advances in the US midterms are hugely welcome and a great relief. But Tuesday’s vote did not see the hoped-for blue wave, and was not a turning point in itself. What matters is what the Democrats, and the president, do next.Donald Trump was predictably ungracious and combative in what he claimed as a “big victory”, despite his improbable suggestion that it “could be a beautiful bipartisan type of situation”. He thrives on isions. The record turnout (up 31m votes on the 114m votes in 2014) testifies to his ability to fire up his base as well as galvanise resistance. Candidates embraced his nativism, with nakedly racist and antisemitic campaigns. Mr Trump has boasted of the strengthened Republican hold on the Senate – an unsurprising outcome, given how strongly this round of contests favoured the party. The Democrats’ Andrew Gillum made striking inroads in Florida but couldn’t take the governorship. In Ohio, equally critical, Democratic senator Sherrod Brown held on but Republicans triumphed in other races. Mr Trump could be much worse placed for 2020.We can expect him to run against the Democratic House in that race: it will make a convenient enemy. That is precisely because the Democrats have ended the era of unchecked Republican power and can now frustrate his agenda on everything from tax cuts to healthcare and immigration. The resistance has moved into the legislature but they need to show they can be more than the resistance, and can win over opponents. Critically, they now have the power to investigate him this is not “presidential harassment” but sorely needed oversight. Mr Trump has threatened retaliation, but the biggest challenge for Democrats is picking the right targets and the priority is protecting the work of Robert Mueller, whose report into into Russia’s role in the 2016 election and the alleged collusion of the Trump campaign is pending. No longer fearing electoral repercussions, on Wednesday Mr Trump forced out Jeff Sessions – never forgiven for recusing himself from oversight – and put a senior aide who has called for the defunding and reining in of the investigation in his place as acting attorney-general. There was good news for Democrats in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin (where governor Scott Walker was ousted) – all states which fell to Mr Trump in 2016. Beto O’Rourke’s campaign in Texas made him a star. But mobilising support is not enough. The impact of gerrymandering and voter suppression is increasingly obvious. Democrats won the popular vote in four of the five presidential races this century – yet two of those produced Republican presidents. Democratic senators represent around 3.65 million voters and Republicans around 2.5 million. This week shows that electors are waking up. Michigan backed a non-partisan redistricting commission and automatic voting enrolment. Florida passed an initiative restoring voting rights to 1.4 million felons, disproportionately black men Mr Trump won there by 113,000 votes. The Democrats won’t just need the right candidate and agenda in 2020, but a fairer system too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75a718b80b6ae269da3dd67adc2b459fdefb7409/83_94_2910_1746/master/2910.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=58d8712e9cebe278eb9503cda2b5962b","title":"under wraps the rise of the blanket scarf","story":"The autumnwinter catwalks had the trend for oversized scarves well covered. How did it become cool to be swaddled?It has been six years since Lenny Kravitz launched a million memes with his gigantic scarf. This autumn, his neckwear looks a little less daft: the blanket-scarf trend has gone big.Cardi B was one of the first to nail it, wearing a purple blanket boldly decorated with a picture of her own face in lieu of a coat to traverse the concourse at LAX airport earlier this year – the perfect accessory for a celebrity hiding in plain sight.On the autumnwinter catwalks, models also kept things well covered. At Acne Studios, there were scarves to rival even Kravitz’s, harnessed in coat waistbands – handy to stop them getting trapped in bus doors. Isabel Marant paired her blanket scarves with cowboy boots for a western twang, while Jil Sander was a more tailored expression of the trend.Big scarves and blanket scarves tie into the trend for all things oversized, from totes to coats, but they also have a practical point, as a removable layer to stay warm. A happy byproduct is the additional space for logos, which continued to hold their ground on the autumnwinter catwalks. At Acne Studios, scarves the size of bedspreads are decorated with the brand’s signature stamp.The current crop are, she says, “similar in style and texture to those of 50s America”. Early in that decade, oversized scarves were often made from brightly coloured mohair, while in the latter half “fashion adopted the stripes and plaids of traditional cowboy workwear, ponchos, and the brighter chevrons of the Navajo Indians, who wore blankets as decorative but functional layers.”Could the garment’s popularity be read as symbolic? “From the moment we’re born, we’re wrapped in a blanket,” says Rebecca Kramer, the founder of the ethical luxury knitwear brand Aessai, which sells its handwoven scarves at The Conran Shop and Browns Fashion. “They are a symbol of comfort and warmth, and an expression of different cultures.”In light of the craft renaissance, championed perhaps most enthusiastically by the Loewe designer JW Anderson, the blanket resurgence fits a pattern. For Kramer, part of the inspiration for Aessai came from weaving, a symbolic practice in the area of rural Argentina where she grew up, “done with respect for, and inspired by, the environment”.Chelsea Power, a buyer at matchesfashion, links blanket scarves to the integrated way we now see fashion and furnishings, pointing to “this idea is that your clothes, your home and your lifestyle should all sync. People are starting to dress their homes as they would themselves.” It can’t hurt, she adds, that “there is no one saying that a blanket can’t be a shawl”. These days, it’s cool to be swaddled.

This deliciously squidgy, zesty recipe will convince all but the most diehard fruitcake denier.

Avoid this by soaking the dried fruit and peel in either whisky (or cold tea or fruit juice, if you’d prefer to keep your cake teetotal). Cover and leave to steep for six to 12 hours – I usually do this the night before I’m planning to bake.Grease and line a 20cm springform cake tin with two layers of baking paper: this may seem unnecessarily fiddly, but it will prevent the outer layers from burning – very handy when you’re baking with dried fruit, which has a tendency to catch and become very bitter where it sticks out from the sides of the cake.Heat the oven to 160C325Fgas 2½. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl and cream together until very light and fluffy I’d recommend using electric beaters for at least five minutes until it has significantly increased in volume. Gradually add the eggs, beating well between each addition so the mix doesn’t curdle.Sift the flour into another large bowl, then whisk in the baking powder, spice, ground almonds and a pinch of salt. If you’re not a fan of mixed spice, or don’t have it to hand, you can substitute vanilla extract or other sweet spices, though bear in mind that the likes of nutmeg and cardamom are very strong, so go easy with them.Fold these dry ingredients into the butter and sugar mixture, along with the soaked fruits and any remaining soaking liquid, lemon zest, chopped almonds (again, use other nuts or leave them out if you prefer) and ginger, if using. You can leave it out if you like, but it does give the cake a lovely burst of heat.Gently tip into the prepared tin and smooth the surface, then excavate a small dip in the middle to prevent a doming effect as the cake rises in the oven. Bake for about an hour, then cover with foil and bake for half an hour more, checking with a skewer every 10 minutes: it’s done when the skewer comes out a little sticky, but not claggy with mixture.Leave the cake to cool in the tin, then use a skewer to poke holes all over the top and pour over a little more whisky, tea or juice. Leave this to soak in, then tightly wrap the cake, still in its greaseproof paper, in foil and leave to mature. Feed it with more booze (or tea or juice) every week or so (or when you remember), until you’re ready to ice nearer the big day.Heat the jam with a splash of water until bubbling. Spread on top of the cake. Roll out the marzipan on a surface dusted with icing sugar, until large enough to cover the cake. Lift it over the cake, gently smooth down and trim the edges. Leave to dry for a couple of days, then brush with whisky (or cooled boiled water). Repeat the process with the ready-to-roll icing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/258d5513bbc98a53fdfd255bd87aec471365ea94/0_106_4952_2971/master/4952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a082e4019b3f6b574fd0c9c94077f2f6","title":"ravinder bhogal recipe mussel rice sweetcorn soup","story":"A cross between a chowder and a Chinese broth, this will brighten up the darkest winter days in only 15 minutesMy mussel and sweetcorn soup is a cross between a chowder and a Chinese soup.

In came Ander Herrrera and Jesse Lingard for Fred and Marcus Rashford, each of whom were replacements.For Juventus Blaise Matuidi and Joao Cancelo missed out from the meeting two weeks ago, Massimiliano Allegri dropping them to the bench for Mattia De Sciglio and Sami Khedira.Mourinho summarised this fourth Group H game as a quasi-free hit due to second place still being in United’s hands if they lost. Yet he surely gave his players the opposite instruction privately ahead of them walking out into an Allianz Stadium that had been neon-lit lit as part of the pre-match show.They began with Nemanja Matic spraying the ball into space along the right and Ashley Young finding Alexis Sánchez inside the area. This broke down yet it was along this flank that United again moved forward with Sánchez – operating at No 9 – flipping a clever ball out to Young once more. The right-back’s cross was wild and Juventus soon had a corner after Ronaldo’s shot was deflected out.An urgent opening continued when Sánchez and Lingard broke down the left and only a disappointing pass from the latter halted United progress.This was certainly a far brighter opening half showing from Mourinho’s men that in recent outings. Juve were prepared to concede time and space for their visitors to knock the ball around which allowed them to settle.A more conventional rhythm now settled over the contest. Build-up became more methodical, patience the leitmotif. A Ronaldo flick-on, a Sánchez free-kick provided intermittent moments of attack-play as the teams teased openings out.This spell was broken when Victor Lindelof skied a regulation clearance near his area and the error was compounded by the ball being allowed to bounce, so ceding it to Paulo Dybala.United were as relieved to scramble clear as Juventus were when Matic’s clever lobbed pass into Sánchez narrowly failed to deliver.Yet it was from the Chilean’s free-kick moments later that Juve fashioned a break: Luke Shaw missed the ball and suddenly Juan Cuadrado was blazing at David De Gea, who parried and collected.When Shaw was beaten for a second occasion – down Juve’s right – Cuadrado’s shot pinged off Matic and this time De Gea’s save had to be sharp and was.Juve had upped their game and United were clinging on. Ronaldo was free enough to find Sami Khedira and the No 6 saw his effort ricochet from De Gea’s right post.The period ended with the same player’s free-kick being hacked away for a corner and Pogba hitting straight at Wojciech Szczesny and when the referee, Ovidiu Hategan, blew for the break it was United who welcomed what was much required succour.A case of so-far so-good for United continued when the second half started with Mourinho’s men attacking via an Anthony Martial shot that missed to the left of Szczesny. Dybala showed better though not telling precision when his shot crashed back off De Gea’s bar, the goalkeeper quite correctly furious with a defence that gave the Argentinian too long to take aim.After a brief cessation for a Young injury the captain could continue, his problem coming when a sliding tackle launched a United attack in which Pogba’s final ball let him and the side down.Juve were far more menacing when in on their opponent’s goal as Miralem Pjanic again illustrated with a surge down the right that had United back-pedalling.Again a neat United approach involving Lingard and Sánchez foundered when the centre-forward’s back-heel proved wasteful.

VAR would have overturned the decision at once, or at least as soon as the review panel had stopped laughing.That said, there can be no doubt City were deserving winners.A feature of the first half was the ease with which Riyad Mahrez was able to find space on the right flank and the elegance with which he was often picked out by long balls from Aymeric Laporte or shorter ones from Bernardo Silva.The opening goal after 13 minutes came from the latter source, though when Mahrez gathered the ball he still had plenty to do. Two feints and as many changes of direction later, the Shakhtar defender, Yaroslav Rakitskiy, had completely lost his man and probably his bearings as Mahrez reached the byline unimpeded to send in a cross that left David Silva a tap-in.Shakhtar had actually had the first attempt on target when Júnior Moraes sent in a shot that Ederson covered easily yet still managed to fumble, though by the time Silva struck for the first goal the visitors were beginning to find themselves pinned back by the accuracy of City’s passing. Even so, Shakhtar hardly deserved the indignity and injustice of what took place in the 24th minute when City doubled their lead through a moment of high comedy or low farce, depending on your point of view. Sterling showed his customary turn of speed to reach a Fernandinho ball into the box before Mykola Matviyenko, only to deliver a graceful parabola through the air and land in a heap on the ground before he had managed to make up his mind about shooting.It seemed at first sight as though he had not been touched by the defender, and replays clearly established Matviyenko was entitled to protest his innocence. Sterling had actually got his studs stuck in the turf, producing a visible ot and losing his balance due to the sudden loss of momentum, yet when he got to his feet – without appealing at any time for a penalty – he found the referee, Viktor Kassai, pointing to the spot. If the thought of owning up to the referee occurred to the player it was only expressed in a shrug and a sheepish gesture as he made way for Gabriel Jesus to score the penalty.It was not a e, at least not a premeditated one. Sterling might not win any Robbie Fowler awards for sportsmanship, though by the same token the Hungarian team of officials – don’t forget there is an extra assistant behind the goalline for European games – should probably not expect another outing unless it is for a Specsavers ad in the near future. Killing the game in such a manner rather shortchanged the paying public as well as Shakhtar.The game and the atmosphere fell a little flat after that, though City had a couple of decent chances before the interval, Jesus waiting too long when one-on-one with Andriy Pyatov then Bernardo Silva firing over from the edge of the area. Any hopes Shakhtar might have had of clawing their way back into the game disappeared three minutes onto the second half when Sterling picked up a pass from David Silva in the middle of the field, accelerated away from a couple of defenders then took out two more by veering right to beat Pyatov with a curling right-footed shot from the edge of the area.Jesus missed another good chance from open play, putting a close range header over the bar, before adding his second of the night from the spot after Taras Stepanenko brought down David Silva in the area.This time there was definitely contact. There might have been some scope for debate but next to the firs-half incident it was night and day. With Shakhtar dead on their feet after an evening of chasing shadows, Mahrez scored a fifth five minutes from time after Jesus and Ilkay Gündogan had broke from half way. The winger collected Gündogan’s lobbed pass on his chest to fire in from a narrow angle, before Jesus completed the rout in the closing seconds with a deserved goal from open play, the cutest of chips over a stranded goalkeeper from outside the area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a27a5759e4b83c62e08be2f9d85fa92d8b6989b3/0_1_2498_1499/master/2498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1dbbf403890ae13441cf34e4588c0bb","title":"could pep guardiola win title with manchester united","story":"If it is the Manchester derby on Sunday then it must be time to wheel out the arguments about which is the better squad, who would get into a composite team of the city and so on, except as there are several excellent players at the Etihad finding it hard to get into the Manchester City first XI that particular exercise may turn out a little one-sided.In its place comes a debate about the differing qualities and approaches of the two old rivals managing the Manchester squads. Would United still be grinding along so unevenly if they had Pep Guardiola at the helm and would City be out in front at the top of the Premier League and averaging three goals a game under the tutelage of José Mourinho?Stan Collymore can probably be blamed for all this. Consistent in his distrust of Guardiola at City, he suggested the other day that Mourinho at the Etihad would probably have delivered a Champions League trophy by now. While this is highly improbable, given City have yet to reach a final and Mourinho was unable to win the Champions League during his three seasons at Real Madrid, one can almost follow the logic. A team coached by Mourinho would not have gone out to Monaco two seasons ago as a result of conceding six goals home and away, and rather than being so open in the first leg at Anfield last season Mourinho’s plan would almost certainly have been to bore everyone to death for a 0-0 draw.But what about the other part of the argument? Could Guardiola turn the present United side into champions, or would he too struggle with a disparate set of players and seemingly random transfer policy bequeathed by the club’s last three managers and an executive vice-chairman who at times appears to have had enough of reaching for the chequebook to break another record? The safest answer might be that given time Guardiola could probably lead United to the sunlit uplands but instant success may be a tall order considering he failed to win anything in his first season at City.Guardiola doubters will most likely jump in at this point to remind everyone that taking over underperforming clubs has not exactly been a feature of his managerial career. This is an elite manager who has only been associated with elite clubs. In terms of an established level of success City are his biggest risk so far but they were champions two years before he arrived and they have a level of financial backing – the admissibility of which is under investigation – that sets them apart from everyone else in England and just about anyone else in Europe.United are also an elite club and to suggest they have struggled since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down would be to invite complaint from the vast majority of Football League clubs who know what struggle is but these things are relative. United had to compete in the Europa League in Mourinho’s first season and Guardiola has never had to dirty his hands with anything so unhip.What one imagines Guardiola would find most perplexing at Old Trafford is the lack of continuity, perhaps inevitable after three different managers in a short space of time. He values stability above all else and that is what Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City have been able to offer.He said a week ago that one of the first areas he felt he needed to strengthen was central defence, so he went out and bought Aymeric Laporte and John Stones, the first having come to his attention while playing in Spain, the second having impressed with his performances for Everton. Both players are aged 24, and the idea is that their partnership at the heart of City defence will last, certainly for time Guardiola remains at the club.This is hardly foresight of the fiendishly clever variety, simply sensible investment and good housekeeping but it is the sort of thing City appear able to do easily while United are finding it difficult.Mourinho has been chopping and changing his centre-backs all season, buying new ones then asking for more, unsettling various members of his defence with cheap digs and public indications of a lack of confidence, which is one reason why United have lost three of their 11 games while City remain unbeaten.United are playing quite well, much of the storm that surrounded Mourinho and his players a month ago has subsided, but those early defeats along with the consistent form of City, Chelsea and Liverpool mean they have been discounted from the title race already.There is still time for that perception to change should United achieve an attention-grabbing result on Sunday, though until and unless that happens the overall feeling is City are working towards a plan, of which Guardiola is a key part, while United are living hand to mouth, with Mourinho an occasional irritant rather than agent of progress.Perhaps the essential point to note is the idea that Guardiola might lift United out of the doldrums could only happen in a hypothetical pub discussion. In reality, City knew the manager they wanted, knew the club whose success they wished to try to emulate, and were prepared to wait years and invest considerable amounts in backroom staff until all the required pieces fell into place.United did not really know who or what was required once Ferguson departed, the process since has been one of trial and error, and even now club and supporters are ided over Mourinho’s appointment and managerial style. There is possibly not as much difference between the two managers as might be imagined.Both have proven themselves capable leaders, shrewd and regular winners. Each would probably enjoy a degree of success in the other’s job. It is the clubs themselves that are growing apart. City have been forging ahead for the past few years, United standing still at best. For decades the United job was regarded as the biggest in England. At present, demonstrably, it is no longer the biggest in Manchester."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a838c83cb607952c180d478f1dd0ede01ac73fae/537_193_3438_2062/master/3438.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7792cfd4bead52ea9311f9f9270b30e7","title":"juventus manchester united champions league live","story":"“It was very good game, a high-level game. We performed at a high level. After their goal we had five minutes to wake up again. But the team was there from the first minute until the last.”Regarding his post-match ear-cupping gesture, he explains: “In beautiful Italian they insulted me for 90 minutes and then I didn’t insult them. I just made a little thing. I know that millions of Interistas are happy with that. But I respect Juventus, their players and manager and all the qualities they have.”There remains some confusion as to who scored the winning goal. BT think Pogba got the final touch to bundle it over the line but Pogba himself has just been interviewed and he isn’t sure. “It hit a lot of people,” he says. Uefa have it down as an og by Alex Sandro for now. Mata speaks: “What a nice last five minutes! To get three points against Juventus in Italy is amazing. It was very difficult. They have fantastic players and are a top team but we’re going back to Manchester with three points.I have confidence in my freekicks at the moment. I train a lot. The first half was not bad from us. It was quite even. The second half was difficult. It was a fantastic goal from them. After that they had two or three chances to kill the game but they didn’t. And we came back and turned them over. It’s a great feeling. It’s a very big step in the group.” It’ll be fascinating to see what this result does for United beyond putting them in a far healthier position in their Champions League group. Although this game could easily have gone the other way - if, for example,either of the Juve shots that struck the woodwork had gone in - but there was a lot to admire about United. For a start, their start: they began briskly and on the front foot, unlike in several recent outings. Also their resilience and their positivity. Mourinho’s substitutions worked, too. Martial had a terrific game. Smalling, too. Sanchez was very bright util he faded late on. Performances like this are the best way to silence talk about frayed relationships between players and manager.The final whistle sounds and Mourinho walks out onto the pitch cupping his ears and showing a triumphant smirk to the home crowd, who respond with deep boos. Why always him? Meanwhile, United’s players smile and congratulate each other for a superb comeback. They looked to be on the ropes after Ronaldo’s sublime opening goal but they showed great character and genuine smarts and skill to reverse the run of play and nab a precious win. Max Allegri’s substitutions backfired, too. It’s a spectacular result for United from a much improved performance. 90+4 min: Martial booked for kicking the ball away in anger after being penalised near the half way. Time for Juve to pump it into the mixer ...90+3 min: United repelling heavy pressure from Juve. And then they rip down the other end and try to wrap it up on the counter. Martial slips in Rashford, who tries to smash it past the out-rushing Szczesny. The keeper gets enough off a touch to deflect it over the bar. What a sensation! United have a come from a goal down to lead in Turin thanks to two goals in less than four minutes! A vicious in-swinging freekick from Young did the damage, with Szczesny taken by surprise and pushing it off his line right into Alex Sandro, who couldn’t do anything to stop it bouncing off him and into the net! 88 min: Dybala screws a shot way wide from 20 yards.87 min: What a precious goal that could prove for United. And they earned it thans to a few minutes of nifty attacking, led, in particular, by Martial. Young does a decoy run over the ball ... and Mata steps up and curls the freekick over the wall and into the net, past Szczesny, who had started moving the other way! 86 min: Freekick to United in a dangerous position. Twenty yards out and quite central, and all following more dextrous play by Martial before Pogba is taken down.84 min: Lovely work by Martial, tricking his way past two on near the byline and then firing in a low cross. Szczesny bats it away. 82 min: Thanks to all of you who wrote in to confirm that Vardy goal was against Liverpool. Though Matt Richman insists that a better comparison would be with a goal struck by Robin van Persie against aston Villa. 80 min: Rashford lets fly from 20 yards. It’s a good effort that bounces just wide.United substitution: Mata and Fellaini on, Herrera and Sanchez off. Bit baffled that Pogba survived that switch. 77 min: Pjanic has a pop from over 25 yards. It’s a rapid, swirling effort that whizzes past De Gea ... and inches over the bar! United are just about staying in touch here ...76 min: Ronaldo blems the freekick straight into the wall.75 min: Herrera and Dybala booked because Herrera pulled Dybala back. Juve players surround the ref to demand an explanation but he can’t come up with on. But Juve have a freekick about 30 yards out, dead central. Wonder who’ll take it?74 min: Cuadrado canters forward, leaving a three v three attack for Juve. He’s got a player to either side and takes the sensible option, ie passing to Ronaldo. but Ronaldo is closed down quickly and has to lay it back to Cuadrado, who now has a free shot from eight yards .... and he spoons it over the bar! What a let-off for United!72 min: There’s renewed brashness to Juve’s play. They sweep forward, making United look ordinary. Cuadrado lays a pass back to Pjanic, who tries to guide a sidefooter into the bottom corner from 15 yards. But he gets his calculations wrong and whacks it several yards wide. Ominously, though, United couldn’t get close to Juve during that whole move. 70 min: Young’s cross from the right is too high for Martial.68 min: While I was trying to recall who it was that Jamie Vardy scored a slightly similar goal against (Liverpool?), Juve almost add another. This time De Gea did react, batting away a shot by Pjanic from 10 yards. Lindelof did well to get to the rebound first. That is simply brilliant! Bonucci dropped a beautiful pass from just inside United’s half over the head of Lindelof and into the path of Ronaldo, who smashes it first time on the run and on the volley past a stunned De Gea from 10 yards! 61 min: Shaw makes an excellent, courageous headed clearance in front of De Gea. If he hadn’t made it, Cuadrado would have had a prime opportunity to turn Ronaldo’s cross from the left into the net. 58 min: United enjoy a bout of possession. Martial and Sanchez perk up when they get near to the Juve box, trying to break through with some dainty flicks and passes. Juve foil them at the expense of a corner. Sanchez’s first delivery is a beauty, forcing Szczesny to scramble it out for another one. This time Sanchez’s delivery is rotten. 56 min: De Sciglio flies past Pogba down the right and pings in a low cross. Lindelof smacks it clear. 53 min: A break in play so that Young can receive treatment. Sandro gets a booking for the tackle that hurt the right-back.51 min: It’s been a curious game from Pogba so far. He has hardly been involved. And when he has got the ball, he hasn’t made much use of it. He made a good run a moment ago to invite a pass from Sanchez, but when he got it wide in the box, he donked a weak cross straight to a defender. That’s how it’s been going for him so far today.49 min: Dybala collects the ball from Cuadrado at the left-hand corner of the United box. He’s got space to turn and shoot, and he bamboozles De Gea with a vicious curling shot. The keeper, motionless, watches it fly by him and crash against the crossbar! 48 min: Fine play by United! Patient, snappy exchanges on the outskirts off the Juve box. Then Martial made a burst between two players and tried to guide a curler into the bottom corner from a tough angle. He missed by about a yard.47 min: A mistake by Lindelof gives Juve a platform for attack. Smalling bails out his teammate by beating Dybala to a pass from Ronaldo.46 min: Off we go again. No changes made by either side during the break.Want to catch up on how the earlier matches unfolded today? Here is all you need to know.It’s been a satisfying half for United, who have shown much more poise and confidence than they did two weeks ago. They have been compact and restricted Juve to few openings - other than when Khedira hit the post while free eight yards out - and in possession they have been patient and progressive, without really threatening to score. Sanchez has been particularly bright.45+1 min: A Ronaldo drive from way out takes a deflection on its way wide. Dybala’s corner provokes a moment of panic in the United box but Smalling eventually clears. 45 min: There will be at least one more minute. Pogba tries to end the half on the high by bending the ball into Juve’s net from the corner of their box. Szczesny saves comfortably.

City fully in control in Group F, although a late goal for Hoffenheim at Lyon means City don’t qualify with the win tonight. A miraculous 2-2 draw for Hoffenheim actually, who came back from 2-0 down with 10 men. This is how things stand. It would take a miracle for City not to qualify.Fair play to Gabriel Jesus – he’s been inconsistent this season but scored a hat-trick tonight, twice taking responsibility from the spot before using his new-found confidence to score an audacious chip at the death. Pep Guardiola will be delighted.Elsewhere there were good displays from David Silva, Fernandinho, Riyad Mahrez, Raheem Sterling (what a goal, btw) and Aymeric Laporte, whilst Sergio Aguero and Leroy Sané will be fully rested for Sunday’s Manchester derby. A perfect night for City.You can read Paul Wilson’s match report right here. Cheerio! Raheem Sterling speaks about the controversial first-half penalty: I went to chip the ball and I don’t know what happened next. I kicked the turf. I don’t think I felt any contact. Apologies to the ref and apologies to Shakhtar.We needed the win to keep the pressure on the others. Defeat to Lyon was a wake-up call and in the Champions League, these things can happen.”Um, City fans won’t be delighted to hear that Manchester United have taken the lead at Juventus, though an own goal. Scenes! Nothing between the two sides. Hat-trick for Gabriel Jesus, but suicidal defending from Shakhtar: Mahrez picks Rakitskiy’s pocket, sends Gabriel Jesus through on goal and the Brazilian simply chips the ball over Pyatov into the net. An exquisite lob. It’s not been the most comprehensive performance from Gabriel Jesus but he’s only bloody scored three times. So can’t complain. 90 min: Two minutes added on here. I suggest you head over to Juventus v Manchester United, because Juan Mata has just scored a free-kick to equalise for José Mourinho’s side. 88 min: City could have scored another couple since my last update. Mahrez, now operating on the left, crosses a dreamy ball behind Shakhtar’s defence and Pyatov rushes out and just about gets there. Ismaily cleans up and it’s a good job he did as otherwise Sterling would have had an open goal. 85 min: The irony is that since those substitutions, Shakhtar have probably been the better side. But in being more attacking, Shakhtar left gaping holes at the back. City counter-attack with three-one-one. Gabriel Jesus feeds Gundogan, who dinks a wonderful cross to Mahrez and the back post. The Algerian takes the ball down on his chest, lets the ball bounce and lashes the ball past Pyatov at the near post. The goalkeeper could probably have done better. Mahrez has been threatening that all night. That is now 20 goals in City’s last five home games, they have conceded just one in that time. This would also be City’s biggest ever Champions League win.81 min: Whatever happened to Ederson’s hair, I don’t like it. 79 min: Shakhtar have a free-kick, about 30 yards from goal. Following in the footsteps of free-kick-taking centre backs like Alex, Ronald Koeman and David Luiz, Rakitskiy steps and up and curls a wonderful effort towards the top corner, but Ederson gets across to make his first meaningful save of the night. 77 min: Fernandinho, who had assumed the captain’s armband when Silva went off, is himself withdrawn for Delph. A former Shakhtar player, he is clapped off by both sets of supporters. Shakhtar also make a double change: Taison coming off for Alan Patrick (who sounds like he could be from Beswick but is actually Brazilian) and Maycon coming off for Wellington Nem. 75 min: Is there anybody that can do a stepover as effortlessly as Mahrez? The winger runs at Ismaily, does a couple of lollipops, but shoots wide. 74 min: David Silva’s work is done for the evening. One goal, one assist, cheers. Gundogan comes on to lukewarm applause. Just as he did before, Gabriel Jesus sends Pyatov to his left, and shoots to the keeper’s right, his shot just creeping under the bar. A cracking penalty, actually. 73 min: Stepanenko is complaining to the referee, claiming he got some of the ball in a tackle on David Silva, but it’s an obvious spot-kick. 72 min: Hoffenheim fans, do you want to the good news or the bad news? Always bad news first. Well, you’re down to 10 men – Kasim Nuhu seeing red – but you have scored through Andrej Kramaric, who now has three Champions League goals this season.70 min: Cristiano Ronaldo has just scored an absolute pearler of a volley against former club Manchester United. Join Barry Glendenning for that one, if you’re interested. 68 min: Manchester City have never won a Champions League game by more than four goals, so that’s something to aim for, at least.66 min: Shakhtar have a corner! Ismaily got forward well to win, but Rakitskiy doesn’t bother to beat the first man with his cross. Waste. 64 min: Does anybody else find City fans’ singing of ‘Allez, Allez, Allez’ slightly grating? 62 min: Júnior Moraes, Shakhtar’s striker, has been woefully isolated this evening and he is hooked by manager Paolo Fonseca. Olarenwaju Kayode, who was actually on Manchester City’s books last season (on loan at Girona and Shakhtar) comes on in his place. 60 min: City make their first change, Guardiola with one eye on Sunday’s Manchester derby. Kyle Walker comes off, Danilo comes on. The Brazilian has only played in the League Cup this season, so this is probably quite exciting for him. 58 min: Bernardo Silva doesn’t really have much pace but he somehow sears past Mayviyenko to the byline and crosses, the ball dinking through the six-yard box where nobody is there to tap it in. 56 min: City are the outright favourites to win this season’s Champions League. You can see why this evening. And this is without five of their most important players: Agüero, Mendy, De Bruyne, Sané and Kompany.54 min: Another penalty shout for City! Silva showed exceptional feet, turning Kryvtsov in knots, and the Shakhtar defender clumsily falls leans on the back of the Spaniard, who goes down just in front of the byline. Another tight one, seen them given, but probably the right call. City’s fans literally don’t care, almost as if they would rather see a tight game than this descending into 4, 5, 6-0. 52 min: Not that the City fans are bothered. “Stand up, for the champions” sing the home crowd. 50 min: Penalty shout for City as Sterling goes down in the box! Not given! Ooooooooh, that was probably another wrong call, but perhaps a hangover of the one that he did give in the first half. Sterling played a one-two with Zinchenko, Mayviyenko got the wrong side and put his arm across Sterling’s path – the Englishman went down a little easily, but it’s probably a foul. A wonderful, wonderful solo goal. Sterling picks the ball up with his back to goal in midfield, turns sharply, somehow squeezes past the pincer tackles of both Maycon and Stepanenko, and curls a peach into the top right-hand corner. That’s a Fifa goal, an R2 finish. Wow. Well that’s that then. 46 min: I do hope that Shakhtar show a bit more attacking intent in this second half. I know that they are missing Marlos, one of their playmakers, but they haven’t threatened at all. Peeeeeeeeeeep! And we’re back underway at the Etihad. Have you got any more examples of sportsmanship that has warmed your heart in years gone by? Doesn’t have to just be limited to penalties beingnot being awarded, of course. You can email me michael.butler@the or tweet me @michaelbutler18.I always liked West Ham’s Paolo Di Canio choosing to catch the ball rather than score when Everton’s goalkeeper Paul Gerrard lying injured in the penalty area. He won the Fifa’s Fair Play Award for 2001 for that. Here is another example of sportsmanship, courtesy of Matt Northam. Elsewhere, it’s Juventus 0-0 Manchester United at half-time. For the rest of tonight’s scores, click here. I’m hearing that Guardiola actually tried to talk to the fourth official about not awarding a penalty. Still, he didn’t protest enough for it not to be given. 44 min: An email, from Geoff James. “Sterling may be a superb player, but he’s just demonstrated that his sportsmanship and ethics are woeful. After the match, of course, he’ll say he “wasn’t sure there was contact”. As for the officials, there’ll be usual lack of accountability or even the decency of an answer at all.”Not sure I agree with all of that, and it’s not Sterling’s job to decide if it should have been a penalty. At worst, it’s probably a good opportunity missed for him to get some good press.It will be interesting to see if the officials do hold their hands up though. Such a glaring error, you’ve sort of got to come out and just say sorry. 42 min: Brilliant football from City.

Unlike many other studies, older teenagers and adult women – who tend to have higher rates of FGM – were not included. The research developed estimates by pooling and comparing FGM data by proportion across countries and regions, using a meta-analysis technique.Nafissatou Diop, coordinator of UNFPA-Unicef joint programme, said it was possible that girls included in the study would still undergo FGM at a later point in their teenage years.“Some girls who have not undergone FGM may not have reached the customary age for cutting and may still be at risk,” said Diop. “The age at which the girls are undergoing FGM changes from ethnic group to ethnic group. In Kenya, for example, the Somali community practice FGM on girls aged three to seven. But in the Maasai community they practice FGM when the girl is a teenager, aged between 12 and 14.”Although global FGM rates are falling, she added, increasing numbers of girls will be living in countries where FGM remains prevalent by 2030.“Because of the demographic trends, the absolute number of girls and women undergoing FGM will continue to increase,” said Diop.The authors also warn that while rates of FGM are falling in many areas, this downwards trend could easily be reversed.“If we think, ‘OK, let’s celebrate,’ and we don’t continue with the same efforts, that may have reverse consequences,” said Ngianga-Bakwin Kandala, the report author and professor of biostatistics at Northumbria University. Risk factors – such as poverty, poor quality education and support for FGM among some religious leaders – continued to persist, he said.The study was based on data collected through demographic health surveys, developed by ICF International, and multiple indicator cluster surveys, which are directed by Unicef. Data ranged from the years 1990 to 2017 for 29 countries across Africa, and two countries in western Asia: Iraq and Yemen.Kandala added that trends varied both within and between countries.The report drew on 90 sets of survey data, covering 208,195 girls. The report did not examine the reasons why FGM rates had fallen, but said it was likely to have been driven by policy changes, national and international investment. National laws banning FGM have been introduced in 22 out of 28 practising African countries, according to the campaign group 28 Too Many.In Somalia, where there is no national legislation expressly criminalising FGM, anti-FGM campaigner Ifrah Ahmed said the practice was still prevalent. “I remember being at a school in Mogadishu asking girls about FGM. All the girls said they were already cut. Just one said she hasn’t yet,” she said, adding the girls were aged between seven and 12 years old.The report concluded that if the goal of eliminating FGM was to be reached, further efforts were urgently needed, including working with religious and community leaders, youth and health workers.“This package of comprehensive intervention could include legislation, advocacy, education and multimedia communication,” the report said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40fe4177ad26584b73aef0d432d06163890a5120/0_43_700_420/master/700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=448892c4fb75461bad4f38dd2b66860a","title":"learned about men tinder lane moore dating","story":"Comedian Lane Moore has crafted an entire show out of swiping left, and right, on the app over the last four years. Here are her biggest takeawaysIn 2014, I started Tinder Live! – a comedy show exploring the crazy world of Tinder. This means that in the last five years, I’ve spent many, many hours browsing the app (so much so in fact that I am relieved there’s no way to know how many hours I lost on there).Like many people, I’ve had multiple profile versions, and deleted and undeleted my profile countless times. It’s come to the point where I frequently see the same men and think, “You’ve come up like five times now buddy, what’s going on, are you OK?”Through all this swiping, I like to think I’ve learned a lot about men. To be fair, “men” in this case can mean men I’ve never met but see a lot on Tinder, men I did meet on Tinder and men I talked to on Tinder but never went out with. Here’s what I learned, using an admittedly broad brush because it’s what dating apps push you to do: sense a pattern and then become upset by how persistent the pattern is, leading you to believe (usually falsely) that everyone is the same.This blows my mind. So many men on Tinder will bemoan becoming pen pals, say they don’t want their time wasted and just want to meet already, but will also think that their saying “Hey” and asking you how your Sunday was, the end, should be enough conversation for you to invest $50 and two hours getting ready and traveling to a bar to see if they’re worth your night out.I guess the idea here is to have no connection at all, and presume this guy is the total package, and to spend a few hours in person seeing if you’re wrong because, eh, what’s a waste of a night of your life? I don’t get this, I’ll never get this, and I hate it.I’ve seen so many men try to find a cute, chill way to say in their bio that casual sex is fine I guess, but they’d prefer a connection lol no big deal or not haha whatever: here’s a quote from The Office. It’s such a bummer and so relatable. Because while men are busy trying to be coy about whether or not they want something more, so are women.But what if, WHAT IF, we were both honest and both got what we truly wanted?I don’t know if it’s in an effort to play it cool, but even men who “super like you” will not message you. They won’t message you first, leaping at the chance to because OMG you liked them back and they liked you so much! And they might not even message you back if you message them first.Nope, they super liked you, just to let you know they’d … what? Super bang you? I have no idea, but it really bums me out.I’m convinced the guys who match with you and never message you just love online dating because they like having a capsule full of women who would, in their minds, definitely sleep with them. Which is bizarre because when I swipe right, it’s because someone’s face – combined with my very vague idea of who they are – is enough to get me to the next level. I want to know how they speak, how they treat me, how their mind works, what jokes they tell, what they do, who they are, how they’d be to date. And then maybe, maybe I’ll meet them and see if I wanna meet them again.I don’t think I’ve ever swiped right on someone and thought, “1010 would fuck. I don’t even need to know if this guy has a brain, or if he hates gay people, or has a swastika tattoo. Nope, my vagina says yes!” But whatever you need to tell yourself, dudes.And then there are the yellers. These are the guys whose profiles just say, “I’m on here to get off this app. Please don’t waste my time. If you can’t carry a conversation, swipe LEFT!!!”I get it. Spend long periods of time on any dating app with the intention of finding even the most fleeting meaningful connection and you’re bound to get to a point where you’re tempted to make your profile, “OMG if you don’t want to meet someone on here swipe left, seriously, WTF I’m a good person!!!!!!!”The yelling and aggression aside, it’s comforting for me to know that some men are as fed up as women are with the games and the flakiness and the waste of time that dating apps can be.I’ve had friends tell me I should change my settings to include much older men, but I have to tell you I’ve had zero experience with older men being kinder or more engaging or self-aware or more forthcoming and giving on dating apps. In my experience, you’re just as likely to find a man who seems sweet and takes you on cute dates and is charming and fun and 23, as it is to find a guy who is boring and selfish and lazy and 38.The idea that all older men are wonderful gems and all young men are worthless erections is reductive and untrue. So calm down, everyone! Let’s just stop advising each other to choose a 50-year-old dude when we’re 25.As much as it could be easy to end this on a negative beat, I will not do it.If I thought dating apps were full of creeps and losers and nothing more, I wouldn’t be on them at all. Many guys whose profiles are absolutely ridiculous end up being surprisingly sweet. And that is how I know, or at least suspect, that sometimes the guys with the ridiculous profiles are just trying to be what they think women want them to be.They’re trying to be what we’re all trying to be online: fun and casual and with an appropriate and not too excessive amount of human feelings. And the good news is, sometimes they let themselves go beyond that and actually connect with the person in front of them.I have so many friends who met their now husbands and wives on Tinder. It happens, and in increasing numbers. And they’ll sometimes blush and regrettably tell their story: it’s stupid, yeah, we met on Tinder, I know, it’s weird. But that’s what keeps me swiping, and I think that’s what keeps the gems – the really incredible gems of men who I’m still really excited to meet – swiping too.1. Which one is it? Whenever I see a group of people in a Tinder photo, I call it “Which one is it: the game”. Are you in a cult? Is this a group thing? Are you incapable of being alone? Either way, I hate this and all genders do it. Please stop.2. Writing that you’re a feminist in your bio if you’re an heterosexual man. Why did you need to write that your interests were “pizza, beer, and thinking women deserve equal rights?” I’m glad you’re interested in that but again, why is that there?3. Sending a ‘hey’ message. How are we going to get anywhere good that won’t end in us saying, “What’s up?” “Not much” and both wanting to punch ourselves until we fall asleep alone in separate rooms?4. Saying you don’t want casual sex when you totally do. We’re going to meet you and eventually find out you just want casual sex so please just say that and save us all some time, no shame in honesty there.5. Not messaging at all. I know you’re probably tired of sending the first message (I send lots of them myself) but what’s better? Being “right” and single, or sending the first message?Lane Moore is a comedian, writer, actor, musician and creator of the critically acclaimed comedy show Tinder Live.

The two visited O’Rourke’s campaign at the primary stage in February.Laura Parker, Momentum’s national coordinator, said that Momentum would invite members of the O’Rourke campaign team to the UK. “If Beto can come within three points of winning in deep red Texas, the field really is wide open for left candidates who harness the power of a mass movement,” she added.Over the course of the campaign, O’Rourke activists knocked on over 2.8 million doors and made more than 20 million calls to voters, with the candidate himself visiting all 254 counties in Texas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80089918e53fc819d4616a20c7035e9dc1a02370/0_18_598_359/master/598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74347b1700645263e629f2358758b423","title":"steve bell theresa clown condom dave satirical cartoonist","story":" cartoonist has been casting a satirical eye on politics for decades. Now his sharp and funny views on events since 2015 are collected in a new bookHow on earth did we end up where we are? Back in early 2015, everything seemed, if not exactly in good hands, then at least quite settled. Then David Cameron wrecked everything by winning an outright majority in the general election, forcing him to keep his promise to hold a referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU.It was also all change in Labour Land. Ed Miliband stepped down and the hitherto unremarkable backbencher Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the opposition. Nick Clegg merely faded into invisibility.Then came Brexit: an outcome to the referendum that no one expected and whose meaning politicians are still struggling to interpret. So Dave stepped down and Theresa May fought off a bunch of no-hopers to become the second worst postwar prime minister. After Dave, of course.Brexit means Brexit. Strong and stable. My arse. The 2017 election put paid to that and now we are left wondering how a Northern Ireland backstop can be both definite and indefinite.

It means a greater focus on preventing gender-based violence, on girls’ education, on childcare and on women’s health. But the benefits are also felt more widely. After all, if half the population is systematically excluded from politics then you’re also excluding half the talent.“A parliament where women are a rare sight is a parliament working with one hand tied behind its back a more representative parliament leads to better decision making, better politics and ultimately a better government.”May told the MPs: “Getting elected is only half the battle, of course. We also have to make the system work once we are a part of it, and doing so in what is often a male-dominated and male-oriented environment is not always easy. Let’s make sure women and girls know that, whatever their views, whatever their party and whatever others may say, a woman’s place is in elected office.”Among those slated to attend the celebratory event – to be held this Thursday in the Commons during the recess and named Women MPs of the World Conference – are a young Bosnian MP who denounced her uncle’s war crimes, a member of the Syrian opposition, and a Gambian women’s rights campaigner.The international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, hosting the event on Thursday, will tell the delegates that “women’s rights are human rights” as they push for progress on women’s equality and economic empowerment.The conference has cross-party support and is backed by Harriet Harman, the longest serving female MP, and the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom.Working groups will look at issues facing women parliamentarians around the world, including bullying, harassment and empowering women once they become MPs.

Is it something to do with the friends Tories keep?Poor Tories. All they wanted was a housing tsar someone to brighten the place up a bit, bring beauty back to public spaces. OK, so Roger Scruton (pictured) had some peculiar notions. He was on record with the view that “many of the Budapest intelligentsia are Jewish, and form part of the extensive networks around the Soros Empire”. Was this antisemitic conspiracy gloop, even before he high-tailed it to the metaphorical golf club with Nigel Farage? Scruton was also persistently anti-Muslim, but still, housing tsar, right? All the government wanted were some pretty buildings to make England look like England again, and if that came with a side order of fulminating bigotry, so be it. Except that was not all: Scruton was also found to bemoan the “orthodox liberal view … that homosexuality is innate and guiltless”. “It’s not normal,” he once supplied to the public record, via the Sunday , in plainer language still.This is the recurring melody of the government’s mood music: every time they chuck a job at one of their mates, the most casual scrawl through their Twitter feed reveals that a lack of any meaningful qualification or transparent application process for the role is the very least of their problems. Toby Young, it turns out, doesn’t just want to educate the masses he also wants to leer at the breasts of famous people and control the procreation of those of low IQ, although, luckily for his bloodline, only those on a low income.

Doctor Who just covered Rosa Parks: your average six-year-old knows that turning public transport into a race war is not a good idea.Bad luck? Or is this the inevitable end of cronyism, since part of the point of a proper and impartial appointment policy is to weed out the bigots before they’re in post? Yet still, if I woke up prime minister, and gave jobs to all my friends, I’m pretty confident that their Twitter woodwork would not be crawling with murky, alt-right propaganda memes worthy of the 1930s.

Definitely, positively, I wouldn’t give a culture brief to the one who wants to eradicate mime and all history of it, and I had an uncle with very strong prejudices against the Spanish based – obscurely – on Michael Portillo, but that was many years ago. I have a friend who dislikes the Yorkshire countryside, and one who reacts more strongly to Piers Morgan than could ever be considered reasonable, but I don’t have any eugenicists in this portfolio, or people who want to reattach guilt to homosexuality.It’s almost as if this isn’t a coincidence: one might just about conclude that the kind of people who think it is OK to give jobs to their friends are the kind of people with shady friends.The train between London and Leeds in the middle of the day is a prime venue for meetings. Most of them are phone meetings: on a recent trip north, I was sat with two guys saying “Sorry, tunnel” into their headsets, and I found it quite easy not to intervene, and just sat there smirking on the inside.On the way home, though, two young women opposite were having a real-life get-together, starting – in that bonding way women do – with a disposition on how nice absent Person A was. She’s really nice. Everyone loves her. “She probably isn’t that nice,” I wanted to add. “People who everyone loves are always playing some devilish game.” She’s also really gorgeous, totally beautiful, both parties present wished they looked like her. At this point I had to leave and check out the buffet car, otherwise I would have said: “Don’t wish that! You both look great. If I took a picture of you right now on a train, you would look back in 20 years and say: ‘I can’t believe how great I looked.’”When I got back with some BBQ Beef Hoola Hoops, one was saying to the other: “There are three numbers here: 230, 285 and 310. Shall we just take one of them out?” I still had no idea of the nature of their business. One mentioned Tesco and the other mentioned skincare wipes, but they could have been describing their main competitor, or their plan once they reached King’s Cross. Nevertheless, plainly, someone had to say: “There’s quite a lot of difference between those numbers, don’t just take one out, maybe figure out why there are three of them.” And since I was closest, it really should have been me. I filled my face with Hoops. It was the only way not to talk.

Fifteen years later, €20,000 has turned into €20m.Wild, whose family made their money manufacturing Capri Sun, decided to spend a chunk of it trying to professionalise German rugby. “I got sucked in, because I believe if you are going to do something, you do it right,” he says.It almost worked, too. The team Wild built are three games away from playing in the Rugby World Cup. Only the three will probably be the last games they ever play.Germany are one of four teams competing in the World Cup repechage in Marseille this month. It is a round-robin tournament involving Hong Kong, Canada and Kenya. Whoever wins takes the last qualifying spot in Pool B in Japan next year, alongside New Zealand, South Africa, Italy and Namibia. The team of players, staff and administrators Wild has put together have been working towards this moment for the past 10 years. Wild describes it as “the dream of their lives”.The director of rugby, Kobus Potgieter, is one of them. In 2007 he was working as a consultant at the Blue Bulls rugby academy in Pretoria when he was headhunted by Wild, who wanted him to help set up a rugby academy in Heidelberg. “It was a big question for me because I’d never heard of German rugby before,” Potgieter says. It is, he admits, very much “a minority sport” but there are still around 120 clubs in Germany and Potgieter estimates there are about 3,000 adult male players.Germany was once a strong rugby country. The first clubs were set up in the 1870s, and in the 1920s and 30s the national team regularly beat Italy, Romania and even France. But most of those players died in the second world war and afterwards the sport was crowded out by football. It became a university game, which is how Wild first heard of it. “My father was an Olympic rower and also a rugby player,” he says. “When you’re a student in Germany you row in summer and play rugby in winter, so my dad was very much in it.”Wild never played himself but he is a great believer in what he calls “the values” of the sport. “Those principles of integrity, respect, passion, discipline and teamwork should be appreciated and taught because I think they’re needed more than ever,” he says. Football, he says, has a “hooligan” problem. His mentions his friend Dietmar Hopp, who invested his millions building the football club TSG Hoffenheim. “After 20 years he is still being personally attacked because of it”. Hopp recently sued a group of fans for abusing him.Then everything fell apart. In the last year the project was ruined by two rows. The problems started when Wild took over Stade Français in June 2017. In May Heidelberger RK qualified for the Challenge Cup. They were the first German team to do it, until the EPCR threw them out again because Wild now owned two clubs, which was a conflict of interest. He had to give one up and he chose to let go of Heidelberg. “Two weeks before the draw we got told that we’re not allowed to play any more and all these guys lost their jobs,” Potgieter says.At the same time Wild was fighting with the German Federation. “The association itself was really amateurish and I’m not used to that,” Wild says. Last November Wild’s players went on strike to force the federation around to his way of thinking. Without them Germany put out a scratch team who were battered in every game they played. So the federation gave in. It appointed a new president but it came too late. Wild pulled his funding but has promised to give them €2m a year for the next five years if they can find three other sponsors who will match his commitment.Which is where the repechage comes in. Germany squeezed through after Romania and Spain were punished for fielding ineligible players. All of a sudden the Germans were three games away from making a World Cup. Only, they had no money to prepare with. So Wild stepped in again. “I promised them I would pay for the repechage,” he says. “Otherwise they couldn’t even have participated, so I gave them €300,000. I wanted to give them the chance to achieve their dream.” They have used some of the money to hire Mike Ford as coach.Come December Potgieter thinks he will be out of a job too, just like the rest of Wild’s players and staff. “You want to just focus on the games but it’s always on the back of your mind,” he says. “For a lot of us the question is, ‘what do I do in December?’ But we try to push it to the side.”If they can make it through to the World Cup those three sponsors will be easier to find. “We’ve got one more chance,” Potgieter says. “We’ve got a month left, three games to achieve something great for German rugby, for our team, and for ourselves. It’s all in our hands.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f02ef48b9cfa379183f759b310c96f0bc350607/353_0_8710_5228/master/8710.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d12c97df9acb16aeb2907565d711fda2","title":"beyond beijing six chinese cities you need to know suzhou lanzhou qingdao","story":"By 2030 China will overtake France as the world’s largest tourist destination, making culturally rich cities such as Suzhou, Lanzhou and Qingdao major attractionsMost visitors to China are inevitably drawn to the headline-stealing trinity of Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, all enormous, vibrant cities that are, justifiably, at the top of the list of must-sees. However, China has more than 100 cities of over 1 million residents, many of which remain little known to foreign travellers but boast attractions worth more attention.In the southern half of China’s fertile Jiangsu province, Suzhou has earned the nickname the Venice of the East thanks to its network of historic, picturesque canals. Suzhou has long been affluent and it supported a famous arts and cultural scene during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1912) dynasties it maintains a reputation as a centre for intellectuals to this day. While the city is now home to more than 6 million, the majority of whom live in the modern new parts of town, Suzhou’s old town features tiny canal-side alleyways, elegantly arched stone bridges and traditional whitewashed buildings overlooking beautiful gardens.While many come to Suzhou for its refined heritage, the big draw is the city’s historic gardens, nine of which are Unesco world heritage sites. Built over thousands of years by scholars and retired government officials, the gardens are exquisite examples of the classical Chinese style. The largest and most famous is the Humble Administrator’s Garden, which, while stunning, can get extremely busy. Visiting smaller gardens such as the Garden of Cultivation gives a better sense of the peaceful havens the gardens were originally designed to be. The city is also renowned for its silk production and has an excellent museum dedicated to the commodity.Getting thereSuzhou does not have its own airport. High-speed trains run regularly from Shanghai, taking as little as half an hour, and from Beijing, in around five hours.While sprawling, industrial Lanzhou itself is not a pretty town, its position at the head of the Hexi Corridor means it is the gateway to western China and a meeting point for distinct ethnic cultures. Its population of almost 4 million is made up of central Chinese Han, Hui Muslims and Zang Tibetans, influencing the city’s architecture, culture and food. A journey westwards through China is likely to pass through Lanzhou, which for centuries has been a transport hub, a vital stronghold along the Silk Road and the principal crossing point of the Yellow River, the city’s greatest sight.Crossing the Yellow River, which in recent years has been cleaned up and gentrified, is the Zhongshan Bridge, the first permanent bridge built across the river and now a major tourist attraction. From here, it’s an easy walk up the steep hillside of White Pagoda mountain park for good views over the city. Lanzhou’s white-tiled Xiguan mosque is the city’s largest and has Ming Dynasty heritage. Lanzhou is a great place for food lovers its namesake dish, Lanzhou beef noodles, are served spicy for breakfast, while Hezheng Road night market is the place to sample flavours of north-west China, including seasoned barbecued meats.Getting thereTwo high-speed train services a day connect Beijing and Lanzhou in around 8½ hours. Regular daily flights to Lanzhou’s well-connected airport take 2½ hours.Modern Lijiang is on a plateau, 2,400 metres above sea level and features a small Unesco world heritage old town, which is a picturesque maze of cobbled lanes, ided by a network of canals and pools that once provided the city’s drinking water. Lijiang is in China’s Yunnan province, which borders Vietnam to the south, and has long been home to Naxi, Yi and Bai ethnic groups, whose traditions can be experienced at the Impression Lijiang show, a performance that uses the city’s surrounding mountains as a spectacular backdrop.Since being damaged by an earthquake in 1996, the area’s traditional wood and stone buildings have been carefully restored, along with the graceful waterwheels that are among the oldest irrigation tools in China. Lijiang’s beauty has led to it becoming one of China’s biggest tourist draws and, in many ways, a victim of its own success. It is possible, however, to nip off the main tourist drags and wander backstreets free from crowds. With the peaks of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain rising behind, the elegant Deyue Pavilion is extremely beautiful and one of the city’s must-sees.Where to stayFeaturing design elements from local Naxi ethnic culture, Lost Horizon Resort (doubles from £66 room-only) is a few minutes’ walk from Black Dragon pond park, home of Deyue Pavilion. Some rooms have private terraces, others have garden views.Getting thereThere are a couple of flights a day from Beijing to Lijiang’s small airport, taking around 3½ hours. Alternatively fly to Kunming and transfer.While many will, perhaps unwittingly, recognise this seaside city’s name from sampling a bottle of China’s best-known beer, Tsingtao, few may know that Qingdao’s famous brewery is the result of the city’s German past. Annexed by Germany in 1897, after the murder of two German missionaries, it was ceded to the country for 99 years. Qingdao made an ideal deep-water port for the German navy and, while there, they established a brewery that produced the now-famous beer. The city was eventually taken over by the Japanese in 1914, before being returned to China in 1922. Getting thereRegular high-speed trains from Beijing to Qingdao take around five hours, while flying takes 1½ hours.The old port town of Xiamen is perhaps better known to outsiders as Amoy, the name used by foreign traders when the city was one of China’s Treaty Ports, opened after the first opium war ended in 1842. The city, however, first came to prominence during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), when its naturally deep harbour became a hideout for pirates and a centre for illegal imports. During foreign occupation in the 19th century, Xiamen was famous for exporting teas from south-eastern Fujian province, before this trade moved to Taiwan. With mild and pleasant weather all year round, Xiamen is home to some of China’s nicest city beaches. Its relatively relaxed, holiday-resort feel belies the city’s huge size – almost 4 million people live here. There’s an atmospheric old town, with bustling narrow streets leading down to the busy seafront. Gulangyu Island, a 10-minute ferry ride off the city’s coast, was Xiamen’s foreign concession until the second world war and features the crumbling old colonial mansions of Europeans and Japanese settlers. Out into the countryside surrounding Xiamen, the otherworldly earthen Hakka roundhouses are worthy of a visit.Where to stayOn Gulangyu Island, just minutes from the ferry pier, Gulangyu Luyisi Villa Hotel (doubles from £35 room-only) offers uniquely decorated rooms in an old red-brick mansion. At night, Gulangyu is atmospheric, though also exceptionally quiet.Getting thereRegular flights from Beijing take around three hours, while the quickest trains from Shanghai reach Xiamen in about 6½ hours.Haikou, capital of Hainan Island, China’s southernmost province, has all the character of a typical south-east Asian city: a humid climate, pleasantly decaying colonial architecture, a laid-back vibe and palm tree-lined streets. With a population of around 2 million, Haikou is the driving force behind Hainan’s economic development and has long been an important port the city was opened to foreign trade under the Treaty of Tianjin in 1858. Hot year-round, Haikou makes for an interesting stop en route to exploring the rest of the island. Be sure to hit the old town’s unrestored backstreets for a glimpse of Haikou daily life, complete with washing strung up along telephone wires. Arcade buildings are the norm in this area, giving the Qi Lou (Arcade) Snack Street – the best place to sample the city’s street food – its name. Down the coast, the four-mile-long Holiday Beach hosts water activities such as windsurfing and kayaking on its golden sands.Getting thereRegular flights from Beijing take around four hours three hours from Shanghai.

If convicted, he faces life in prison.The trial has prompted security measures that include keeping the jurors anonymous. Guzmán has also been held in solitary confinement and barred from seeing his wife out of concerns he could pass messages to his cohorts.Earlier this week, a defense lawyer asked Judge Cogan to grant a “humanitarian gesture” of letting Guzmán greet his wife, former beauty queen Emma Coronel, in the courtroom before the jury enters.Allowing “an embrace with the railing between them would not pose a threat to security”, the letter read. The judge did not immediately rule on the request.The jury was appointed after two and a half days of interviews by Cogan and lawyers for the prosecution and defense.The New York eastern district courthouse was patrolled by armed guards with sniffer dogs, and a special metal detector erected at the entrance to courtroom 8D, where opening statements will begin on 13 November.Prospective jurors were asked whether or not they know who Guzmán is, whether they have looked him up on the internet or watched the vast coverage of the man in serial TV dramas, and of his case.All of them had heard of Guzmán except for a woman from Ethiopia who said she had “no clue” about him.The proposed jurors were interviewed anonymously, and those selected will remain so – and sequestered for the duration of the trial, expected to last several months.They will be transported to and from the court each weekday by armed US marshals.Candidates were recused for various reasons: One man said on Monday that yes, he had heard of El Chapo from a “delicious” bagel of that name sold at a deli near him, made with smoked salmon and cream cheese. He asked to be recused because he could be identified once that was public.A woman was recused after telling the judge her elderly mother would feel obliged to sell their house and move if she sat on the jury. A Michael Jackson impersonator was recused after saying he was too well-known, and a man because he said he had “definite views on the case”.Another man born in Medellín, Colombia, was recused after saying said he tried to get Guzmán’s autograph, and was a “bit of a fan”. El Chapo is said to have smiled at the admission.Judge Cogan told lawyers that one of the jurors, after learning she was picked, wept while telling him she was afraid of the unwanted attention she would get if it was found out she was on the panel.The woman was kept on after defense attorney Jeffrey Lichtman argued that dismissing her would set the precedent that jurors could get out service “with a few tears”.The prosecution will be led by Andrea Goldbarg, a former deputy district attorney for Brooklyn.Goldbarg worked on the prosecution of Alfredo Beltrán Leyva a former close ally of El Chapo who turned against him, and was arrested in Culiacán, Sinaloa, in 2008 with an arsenal and nearly $1m in cash. He was extradited to Washington DC in 2014and sentenced to life imprisonment for drugs trafficking in 2017.She is also prosecuting the case of the alleged Colombian drug baron Juan Carlos Ramírez, known as “Chupeta”, who was among Guzmán’s main alleged suppliers, and was arrested in Brazil in 2008.Ramírez had been a boss in the Cali cartel and became leader of the Norte del Valle cartel.  understands that Ramírez is cooperating with prosecutors, and may even be a witness at the Guzmán trial."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b759ab4c0edc6781d5df0b359451724ac90d77f0/0_393_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=772e4161f48c34fec90850b80e39664a","title":"the kindertransport children 80 years on im grateful my parents sent me away to carry on living","story":"Bernd Koschland recalls the synagogues burning on Kristallnacht – and how he never saw his parents again after he escaped Nazi Germany the following yearBernd Koschland, 87, was born into a family of Orthodox Jews in Fürth, near Nuremberg, in northern Bavaria. His father was a travelling salesman, his mother a housewife, and he had a sister, Ruth, who was seven years older. He says his parents sheltered him from the deteriorating conditions for Jews in the 1930s, but recalls seeing brownshirts – SA paramilitaries – parading in the streets and once caught sight of Adolf Hitler passing on a train.On Kristallnacht, a cold November night, his family were marched down to the town square with other Jews while their burning synagogues lit up the sky around them. Koschland’s father was taken away to the concentration camp of Dachau, near Munich. He was released a few weeks later, and applied for places on the Kindertransport for his son and daughter, promising that he and his wife would join them as soon as possible. “A child takes a promise like that not just at face value, but at full value,” says Koschland.His place on the Kindertransport was obtained with the help of Jewish organisation B’nai B’rith, and, aged eight, he left Fürth in March 1939, travelling to Hamburg and then taking a ship to Southampton – a picture of the ship, the SS Manhattan which brought 80 refugee children to the UK, adorns the wall of his living room. The only English he knew was one sentence his parents had taught him: “I’m hungry may I have a piece of bread?” His sister was allowed to travel soon afterwards, boarding with a family in south London, but did not see her brother again until later in the war.Koschland went to a hostel in Margate, in Kent, before being evacuated in 1940 to a village near Lichfield in the Midlands, where he boarded with an elderly Jewish family. He exchanged letters with his parents until war broke out in September 1939. One of his great regrets is that, at the suggestion of a school friend who told him that having letters in German in wartime would incriminate him, he destroyed them. “I’ve regretted it every day since,” he says.Koschland lost contact with his parents at that point and spent the war not knowing what had happened to them. He was told of their fate after the war had ended in 1945 by his sister, who met him from school and told him that a survivor of the camps had provided information that they had been deported and were dead, murdered either in Riga in Latvia or Izbica in Poland in 1942. I ask him how he coped with the news. “I took it in my stride,” he says. “There was nothing I could do, and life had to go on. It was only as I grew older that it started to hit me hard, when I heard other people saying: ‘We are going to see Mum and Dad.’ That was something I couldn’t do.”Nonetheless, he says he never had the survivor guilt that plagued so many others who escaped the Holocaust. “I’ve never had that feeling of being guilty. I’m thankful that my parents sent me away to carry on living. I can’t undo the past. I can think of the past, but I have to look at today and tomorrow. That’s the lesson I give to the youngsters I talk to.”Many years later, he was invited to visit Fürth by the town authorities, staying in a hotel overlooking the town square – now renamed Freedom Square – where, on Kristallnacht, his family had gathered as their community burned. “I had the perhaps childish feeling that I can now walk across it, even though you made me stand there, years ago,” he recalls. And walk across it he did, pleased to have outlived the regime that killed his parents.• Remembering the Kindertransport: 80 Years On is at the Jewish Museum, 129-131 Albert Street, London NW1 from 8 November to 10 February www.jewishmuseum.org.ukTomorrow: Ruth Barnett: ‘Years later, my mother appeared, a total stranger’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7421e1d7155d7e9ce678fe711079f700846824a3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a70d659af4438b7c8eeffcd4f59da221","title":"ace adverse childhood experience trauma","story":"US researchers have found early intervention can help prevent negative experiences in infancy turning into long-term health risksby  Lauren Zanolli in New Orleans When Sabrina Bugget-Kellum walked into a neighbourhood clinic in New York for a routine appointment in in 2016, she was desperate. Her son was in prison. She was trying to look after his two young children, who were aged one and two. Their mother was emotionally unstable. Bugget-Kellum did not want the chaos of the adults’ lives passed down to another generation.“We didn’t know if they would be safe with their mother,” she recalled recently. “I began to pray, please God, I need some help. There were so many things going on.”While at the clinic, Bugget-Kellum learned about a new parenting programme designed for carers of young children who have faced early adversity such as domestic abuse, homelessness or the loss of a parent to incarceration. “It was like I had my ammunition and I knew how to fight,” said Bugget-Kellum of the programme.The scheme, called Attachment and Biobehavioural Catch-up (ABC), pairs parents with a coach trained in the needs of infants and toddlers who have experienced trauma.Bugget-Kellum’s coach reinforced simple techniques to form a healthy bond between adult and child, and helped her work through her own emotional wounds to create a less stressful environment at home. The results were so transformative, she said, that she started working as a parent coach for the same programme.“I have a son who is 26 and in prison, so I’m thinking maybe had I had an opportunity to get some of this, I don’t know, maybe I could have been more nurturing,” she said. “ABC gave me the confidence to say, you can do this. I don’t have to be angry with myself any more.”Traumatic or highly stressful childhood experiences are known to have lifelong emotional, behavioural and physiological impacts. Children who are abused, neglected, or exposed to conflict, violence and horror, are far more likely to have drink and drug problems, criminal records and perhaps resort to violence and abuse themselves. But researchers have also found that interventions such as the ABC programme can significantly buffer the damaging effects of stress and trauma, even at a biological level.A growing number of advocacy and public health organisations are working to bring “trauma-informed” approaches into the mainstream for doctors, carers and first responders.Scientists are continuing to untangle the complex biological effects of childhood trauma on the brain and body. Research in the past decade points to “toxic stress” as the root of the connection between adverse childhood experiences (Aces) and health problems in adult life.The theory is that continuous or repetitive exposure to stressful situations through, say, domestic abuse, or growing up in poverty, causes the body’s natural fight-or-flight stress response to stay switched on. Researchers say that without the influence of a caring and calming adult the stress becomes “toxic”, and elevated cortisol levels change the functioning of the child’s brain, weakening the immune system and even altering the way a child’s DNA is “read and transcribed”.“This is the source that a lot of the problems in our society can be traced to,” said Leena Singh, programme director for the National Paediatric Practice Community on Adverse Childhood Experiences (NPCC), which has an office in San Francisco. “There is a saying in public health – we need to move upstream. This is the work that is the root of the root.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theSingh’s organisation is working to integrate screening for adverse childhood experiences into standard paediatric primary care. The programme hopes to recruit 1,000 clinicians to screen 300,000 children for Aces over three years and is running pilot sites at six clinics across the US, with plans to add more.Singh says paediatricians have a vital role to play. They could refer patients for behavioural therapy or social support, but in medical schools they are rarely trained in the impacts of toxic stress. There are logistical hurdles to overcome too, such as how to add another process on to providers that are already overburdened, and how to bill insurers for time spent screening.NPCC says it is working through its pilot sites and member network to resolve those problems. It is also involved, through its parent organisation, the Center for Youth Wellness, with a clinical study on the effects of Ace interventions on certain biomarkers.Ultimately, Singh believes, their work could contribute to long-term shifts in the paediatric field. “If we can address and intervene early when some of these things happen in very young children we can actually prevent some of the risky behaviours and health impacts later in life.”One of the main challenges in pushing the model further, say proponents of trauma-informed care, is the lack of long-term data on the effectiveness of the approach. Researchers, including the CYW group and Mary Dozier, creator of the ABC intervention, say they are working to fill that gap. Many programmes take a two-generation approach to try to short-circuit the cycle of physical, emotional or substance abuse. Tennessee, for instance, is in the third year of its Building Strong Brains initiative, a $1.25m scheme to fund innovative Aces-focused programmes across the state.One programme funded under the initiative, called Thrive by 5, will conduct Aces screening on all pregnant women at the Baptist Memorial Hospital for Women in Shelbyville. Women who report four or more of the different types of childhood adversities (physical, sexual or emotional abuse, neglect, domestic violence, household substance abuse or mental illness, parental separation, orce or incarceration) will receive programme interventions and parenting education.Another programme called Handle With Care, which started in West Virginia and since expanded, allows police officers to notify a child’s school if they are called to their home for potentially traumatic event like domestic abuse or a shooting. School officials don’t receive any incident details but the notice allows them to better respond to behavior changes or offer necessary support to the student.The “infant courts” are also expanding. Zero to Three, an advocacy group for early child development resources, started piloting “safe babies court teams” in 2005, and now has more than 20 sites across the US. The teams work with young children separated by the court from their parents, often because of abuse or neglect, providing developmental medical screening, mental health services and community advocates to ease the trauma of entering the foster care system.Parents can receive psychological services too to deal with traumas of their own – a study by such a team found that more than two-thirds of parents in the programme had an Ace score of four or higher.Tucked inside a bipartisan opioid epidemic bill just signed by Donald Trump, called the Support for Patients and Communities Act, are several federal provisions encouraging wider recognition of Aces and trauma-informed care. The bill calls for an “interagency task force” to identify best practices within three years for mitigating the impact of trauma on infants and children and to create a national strategy to improve coordination of trauma-informed care at a federal level. The bill also authorises the Department of Education to provide grants to schools for mental health programmes to help mitigate the impacts of childhood trauma.Experts say greater cross-sector collaboration and more funding is needed for trauma-informed care to really make a difference. “The lifelong manifestations of that childhood trauma are cross-sector – it effects educational outcomes, employment opportunities, it affects your health,” said Marc’s Lieberman. “You’re not going to make a population-level impact without a cross-sector approach.”That makes the execution of trauma-informed care inherently complicated. But at bottom there is a simple and revolutionary idea, says Lieberman: “It’s about moving from ‘what’s wrong with you?’ to ‘what happened to you?’”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Impending disaster is painfully apparent and yet, time and again, councillors willingly and wilfully hurl themselves lemming-like over cliffs to lose their limited powers in the ravine at the bottom.In 2001, councillors – all councillors not just Dublin ones – lost their powers over waste collection and disposal, following their failure to ratify plans for waste disposal facilities, or any form of waste charging. As a result this power was transferred to council management, hugely unpopular bin charges were introduced, and the Poolbeg incinerator, which all parties opposed, was built.More recently, the failure to agree a route for the Liffey cycle path, which had been six years in the planning, resulted in the scheme being removed from the control of Dublin City Council and handed over to the National Transport Authority.In this case it wasn’t just the councillors (who couldn’t agree traffic ersions past their constituents’ houses) who were to blame, but also council officials, who produced endless iterations of the scheme, one of which saw double-decker buses rerouted through an existing apartment block.The most recent, and one of the most damning failures or officialdom to get to grips with decision making, is the College Green plaza refusal farce. The council tip-toed around the issue for a decade, tinkering with selective traffic restrictions, musing over fountains and statuary, but never really grasping the problem, which required getting buy-in from Dublin Bus before the project went to An Bord Pleanála for approval – a step which itself should have been taken years before.Surely there’s a better way of getting things done in the city. Could this dithering, bottling, buck-passing and procrastination be solved by Dublin having a directly elected mayor?“The central power, the most important point, of having a directly elected mayor, is that they have a ‘bully pulpit’,” Dr Deiric Ó Broin, DIT academic and co-author of the upcoming book Mayoral Governance in Dublin, argues.“The elected role gives them the authority to argue for more investment in the city, for keeping a more appropriate share of the money generated in Dublin. And they have to deliver their job is on the line. If they don’t deliver they may not be re-elected. That concentrates minds.”However, the concept of a mayor is one thing, the reality of the role and its functions is quite another, Ó Broin says.“The big issue is what powers the mayor would have and where would they come from. There is no point if the mayor is just a lord mayor, as in they have significant ceremonial but minor functional role, but who lasts for a five-year term.”Dublin city chief executive Owen Keegan agrees. “If it is to be successful the directly elected mayor has to have real powers, but he or she can only have real powers where the powers are taken from somewhere else. This notion that there’s some unallocated power that you can give to the mayor has no basis in reality – all power is already allocated.”And there isn’t much power within the hands of the council to give to a new mayor, Keegan says. “Since local government is weak here, the power and functions would have to come from central government, and that is a real issue because if there’s a directly elected mayor who is responsible for energy, and communications and transport in Dublin it doesn’t leave very much for the central Government to do.”Another vexing issue is what physical area would be governed by the mayor. “Culturally and politically we are obsessed with counties and county boundaries. I could see an argument for a city-only directly elected mayor and that gets away from that problem, but I don’t see how a city-based mayor could have responsibility for transport in Dublin, which crosses local authority boundaries,” Ó Broin says.This issue of boundaries played a large part in the collapse of the last mayoral plan. In 2013, then minister for the environment Phil Hogan decided, despite there being no legal requirement, that the councillors in all four Dublin local authorities would have to be in favour before Dubliners would get a chance to vote in a plebiscite on whether or not to have a mayor.The following year Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal but it was vetoed by Fingal, whose councillors felt they would be the poor country cousins, largely ignored by a city-focused mayor who would only be after their airport.As Gerry McGuire, a Labour councillor at the time, said there would be “no chance of getting a pothole fixed in rural Fingal”.Hogan showing great fortitude in keeping a straight face said he was “disappointed” as he was “the greatest proponent of devolution probably in the history of the State”.Last year the Government revived the mayoral proposal, making provision for a plebiscite this year, but it has recently kicked the can down the road, and kicked it out of the capital, determining that regional cities would vote at next year’s local elections on whether to have a mayor, but in Dublin it would first be referred to a citizens’ assembly for the capital.It seems like another unnecessary hurdle given that a similar forum spent five months formulating proposals for the mayor’s role in 2013, and, at that time surveys showed public support for a Dublin mayor was up to 80 per cent.Even if Dublin does get a mayor, what the Government appears to be proposing is a toothless role, either a mayor with the same powers as the current lord mayor, except elected, or an “executive mayor” who would take on some of the functions of the council chief executive.A plebiscite to decide whether there should be a mayor is unnecessary, Lacey says. “If the Government is serious about making progress let them legislate for it now. There is no need for a plebiscite. Successive governments never sought permission as they systematically dismantled local government in the past, so let them just repair it.”However, Lacey does not believe it’s necessary that the mayor would be all-powerful from the outset. “Calling for the full range of powers to be set out in advance is misguided. This is a position and a role that needs to be established and then given space to evolve.”But he says he can see particular areas where a mayor could make achievements straight away which might seem minor, but would be significant.“A mayor could initially have responsibility for natural resources. For example there isn’t much point in Dublin City Council cleaning the river Dodder in Donnybrook, if it’s not being cleaned first in Tallaght. Or sports capital grants – it makes no sense for a civil servant sitting in an office in Kerry to decide what local sports organisation in Dublin gets a grant.”Then, he suggests, other powers could be added such as waste and traffic policy, which should be “brought back under control of the council anyway”, he said.Ó Broin cites the system in Copenhagen as one where the mayor having control of these services works well. “The mayor has responsibility for education, welfare, labour services, welfare, climate change and a range of municipal services – Denmark, and Scandinavian countries in general, have very good, empowered local government.”Further afield, Boston and Toronto are recognised as good examples of mayor-led cities, he says. While our nearest neighbours have had some successful mayors, in some British cities, including Stoke-on-Trent, they have scrapped the office.The London model, Lacey believes, is not the system that should be copied in Dublin. “I don’t think the London model is a good one, with an all powerful mayor and a fairly toothless assembly. I’d like to a see a mayor working in partnership with a much smaller council – 24 or even 18 councillors. We should reduce the four councils to a manageable size, and give them more responsibility.”Keegan thinks the London model has worked well, particularly in relation to the mayor’s transport and policing supervisory functions, but he is with Lacey on the reducing in numbers of councillors from the current 63 in the city.“I am impressed by cities that have a small number of full-time councillors. In many cases they have executive functions. I think these councils, with a large number of councillors, make everything very difficult. Dublin City Council is too large. We are twinned with San Jose, where there’s a mayor, and I think they have eight or nine council members.”Keegan, however, remains unconvinced of the merits of having a mayor in Dublin. “I am a little bit concerned that the next ‘big idea’ is the directly elected mayor, and we’ll all lorry into that with great enthusiasm, but I have seen very little convincing analysis as to why this is such a good idea.“It’s been presented as a panacea to everything that’s wrong in Dublin, that will automatically be made right the day after we have a directly elected mayor.”Dublin doesn’t get credit for its success he says. “I don’t accept the notion that Dublin is a basket case. On many parameters Dublin is a very successful city. A good litmus test is the multinationals. They come here because they can attract people to live here. Of course it has problems with transport, and housing but these are problems of success. There was no housing affordability problem when we were in the depths of recession.”The “mad rush” towards the directly elected mayor idea reminds him of the “mad rush” to set up Irish Water. “Water supply was and is a major challenge but there was a notion that if you set up a separate utility everything would be hunky dory, but its implementation left a lot to be desired.”If the implementation of the mayor is poor, Dublin could find itself losing more than it gains, Keegan says.“There are strong arguments for a directly elected mayor, and I’m not saying there isn’t scope for improvement in the city’s governance, but there is a danger if we rush into this it won’t achieve any of its objectives, we’ll lose the things that work, and we’ll be worse off.”Each of the proposals in this Capital Ideas series has been put to a group of three experts for an initial “back of an envelope” evaluation. They are: Frances Ruane, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute Caroline Spillane, director general of Engineers Ireland and Cliff Taylor, economics columnist with The .Caroline Spillane I have reservations about this plan, particularly due to the size of Dublin relative to the country as a whole. One person would have responsibility for 40 per cent of our population. The powers of this office would need to be carefully defined.The proposed mayor would be in a position of power for only five years, which could lead to short-term thinking.Cliff Taylor This proposal has surfaced in various forms over the years and fits into a common theme that restructuring institutions or posts can fix problems. This could be a good idea, but the job spec, powers and budget are key. The benefit depends on how it is structured – and who is elected, of course.It is a useful proposal but to work it requires a new vision for local government, something talked about for years and years but never delivered.Frances Ruane Cities with elected mayors seem to work well. However, in Ireland, this would have to be set up as part of a rebalancing of central and local government, if it is to work. If the city itself does not have decision-making power, then adding a mayor will not solve the problem.Meanwhile, Dublin City Council should work on its governance and adopt an integrated problem-solving planning approach. This must involve all four authorities working together. That would involve no serious resource costs.How can we improve Dublin city\u0026rsquos infrastructure, services and daily life?

Savour that moment because this may well be the very last time this particular ritual will ever happen.If all goes according to a plan laid out by the European Commission, the last-ever mandatory clock change in the European Union will take place in 2019. Member states must notify the commission by April of next year on whether they want to opt for permanent summer or permanent winter time. Whether all 27 states are prepared to go along, however, is not yet clear.This weekend, the Department of Justice (which has responsibility for everything to do with timekeeping) is announcing plans for its public consultation here on the proposal.A recent European Commission online public consultation across the EU found 84 per cent of citizens were in favour of ending the changing of clocks in spring and autumn.The commission trumpeted the fact that it had got 4.6 million responses, the highest number ever received in an exercise of this sort, and that 84 per cent of those backed the change to a single year-round time.Less loudly advertised was the fact that engagement varied significantly from country to country three million of those responses came from Germany, representing almost 4 per cent of that country’s population. In contrast, less than 0.25 per cent of Irish people bothered to respond.The question now is whether inidual member states will agree to proceed along the lines advocated by the commission, which has stated a preference for summer time to be applied universally. There is potential for chaos, with a patchwork of time zones emerging across continental Europe.Initial polling, for example, suggests people in the Netherlands and Denmark would prefer permanent winter time, while Germans want summer time.“We are not proposing that the whole EU either switches to summer or winter time,” said transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a press conference last month. “All we are proposing is that we do it together.”But clock-switching on the Dutch-German border is hardly the desired outcome.An intriguing twist from the Irish perspective is whether the UK, at a moment of heightened political tension, will view this as a symbolic opportunity to flaunt its newly acquired independence.Brexiteers’ enthusiasm for such a stance may be dimmed when they realise it would mean Britain sharing a time zone with Brussels and Berlin for almost half the year.But understandably, media coverage here so far has focused on the prospect of travellers from Dundalk to Newry having to adjust their watches – or of people nipping across from Lifford to Strabane in search of an extra hour’s drinking time.For geographical and historical reasons, Ireland and the UK have been on the same clock since Dublin Time was abolished in the wake of the Rising in 1916.We moved in lockstep with the UK when it experimented with year-round summer time in the late 1960s, and any recent proposals for change, such as one mooted in a Private Members’ Bill rejected by then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2013, have been contingent on decisions made at Westminster and, more recently, in Brussels.So what would the changes mean? If Ireland opts for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, then dawn won’t break in the west of Ireland until almost 10am in mid-December. However, if “winter time” is maintained throughout the year, sunrise in Dublin will occur well before 4am in June, and the stretch in the evenings will be a lot less grand, with sunset happening before 9pm even in midsummer.Those are the extremes, but where permanent summer time offers real gains is in the “shoulder months” of November, February and March, when the majority of people will have much more daylight at the end of their school or working day without too much negative impact in the mornings.There has been a broad attempt across the world in recent decades to do away with annual time-shifts, based on data about their negative health effects and on a more general sense that an additional hour of daylight in the evening is more valuable than one in the morning.Meanwhile, the main rationale for the current system – reduced electricity usage – has been rendered less important by the introduction in recent years of energy-efficient electric lighting. Lifestyles have also changed enormously since the current system’s introduction a century ago, and even since the last experimental change 50 years ago.Flexible working time, increased leisure opportunities and longer retail opening hours all have an effect on how we spend our day.The main impediment to change, it seems, is institutional. In the US, legislators in California and other states are also pushing for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, but they need to persuade the federal government before they can proceed. As in the EU, American legislation allows each state to decide its time zone but forbids inidual states from choosing when or if to change their seasonal clocks. Whether the gridlocked US political system can respond remains to be seen.Here, the Department of Justice’s public consultation asks three questions. Do you want to stop changing the clocks twice a year? If the clock changes stop, do you want to remain on summer time or winter time? Is staying on the same time as the UK more important than your choice of summertimewintertime?“It is very important that as many citizens as possible respond to this consultation and express their views so that the Government may take account of public opinion when considering this proposal by the EU,” says Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, clearly implying that the Government will take account of public opinion without being bound by it.Ultimately the success or failure of the proposal may come to be seen as a test of the EU’s ability to act quickly and decisively on a simple issue which will have an almost immediate effect upon people’s lives. The process so far has been startlingly fast, but the national consultations may be a different matter, depending perhaps on the views of the people who get up early in the morning."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3689661.1541626384!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach wishes he could direct health staff to work through january","story":"An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, responding to a question from Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, has said that nurses and doctors should not take holidays over the Christmas period to help ease hospital overcrowding. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach   Leo Varadkar, speaking in Finland, said his comments should not be seen as  controversial . Photograph: ReutersThe Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has robustly defended his comments on health service staff working through early January.Speaking to journalists in Helsinki on his way to the European People’s Party (EPP) conference, Mr Varadkar insisted that all he was talking about doing is what every business does, marshalling resources at peak times.Asked if he would be issuing a directive to staff he said “I wish I had the authority to do that” - but that was a matter for the HSE.“Every business has a period of peak demand,” he said citing the first weeks of September for those in education, budget time for those in politics and the summer months for those in tourism. “It makes sense if you are running your business well to always make sure that you match peak demand with peak resources,” he said. “So we know that peak demand in the health service happens in the first two weeks in January. Therefore it makes sense that the minimum number of staff should be on leave during that period. No bed should be closed because people are on leave. The emergency department and medical consultants should be there. The surgeons can take their holidays during that period because most of the operations get cancelled anyway, so it’s a question of matching peak demand with peak resources,” he said.That’s the norm across industry and services, he said, and should be the case in the health service. “It shouldn’t be a controversial comment,” he said.He said at present hospitals work on a skeleton staff over the 12 days of Christmas, radiology departments and laboratories don’t work “at full throttle”, patients come in, they don’t get their tests, diagnosis and treatment and “the numbers add up and up and up and guess what happens in the first week in January. So what I’m saying is that needs to change this year”. Of course staff would be paid for that and get their annual leave entitlement, he insisted. He said more money, more staff and more beds on their own do not work which is why he was advising the HSE to change things this year.Mr Varadkar was following up comments he made in the Dáil on Tuesday night when he said nurses and hospital consultants should not take holidays in early January, as plans to deal with overcrowding in hospitals this winter were being discussed. He said radiology departments and laboratories should also be open and operating “at full whack” over Christmas and new year. “We need to make sure that every bed will be open. That is the kind of winter plan we need, not the kind we have had for years and years that does not work,” he said.The comments from the former health minister and doctor have been criticised by health service staff who say lack of beds are among the issues causing patients to languish on trolleys in emergency departments.There were 591 admitted patients waiting for beds in hospitals across the State on Wednesday morning, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) said.The Irish Hospital Consultants Association’s president Dr Donal O’Hanlon said he was extremely disappointed with the Taoiseach’s comments “ which have attempted to trivialise the very serious issue of the hospital bed shortage”.He said the most significant issue in the health service is the lack of capacity in public hospitals. “The trolley crisis is not just over the Christmas period. The lack of capital investment in our public hospitals has resulted in a year-round crisis for hospitals which are struggling without the means to provide a proper standard of care to their patients,” he said.Dr O’Hanlon said the required expansion in acute hospital bed capacity was acknowledged a review of bed capacity and the National Development Plan which provides funding for an additional 2,600 hospital beds. “However, the additional beds have not materialised. There is a complete lack of urgency in putting in place additional hospital beds even though there is a record number of patients being treated on trolleys year-round and around 20 per cent of the population on waiting lists for acute hospital and other care,” he added.He also pointed to the fact that over 500 permanent hospital consultant posts are unfilled. “The ongoing trolley crisis will not be solved by cancelling leave at Christmas time,” he said.Dr Peadar Gilligan, president of the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) and himself an emergency medical consultant, said a lack of beds and resources rather than doctors and nurses on leave is causing overcrowding in hospitals at Christmas. Blaming doctors and nurses for the failures of the health system was not helpful or appropriate he said. He told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland the Taoiseach’s comments in the Dáil were more of a reaction to his frustration at the relative lack of progress on the issue of overcrowding in hospitals and the increase in waiting lists.“The reality is that doctors and nurses and their leave is not a contributor to the huge overcrowding that we have of hospitals in Ireland manifesting in the emergency departments,” Dr Gilligan said.“The reality is the lack of capacity and whilst the Taoiseach referenced the fact that there are 247 additional beds in the system, that is a start, but the immediate requirement is more like 1,260 moving towards 2,600 in the near future, so it would be more helpful if we were seeing a strategic plan with regard to the delivery of that additional capacity and also with regard to the recruitment debacle in the country at the moment”.Oncologist Prof John Crown said the health service is not under funded, it is “malfunded” and that the Taoiseach’s call for nurses and doctors to work over the Christmas holiday period is “nonsensical”. The business plan of the HSE is about bed closures and “let them wait” he told Newstalk’s Pat Kenny show. If more doctors and nurses were appointed staff would “row in” with plans for full service over holiday periods, he said.Prof Crown called on politicians to reduce their three week Christmas holiday break and instead pass legislation to remove the mandatory requirement to retire at age 65. This would make a huge difference and ease the pressure to find replacements for doctors and consultants forced to retire. Many want to continue to work, he said.“We don’t have enough people in posts, there is a shortage of physiotherapists, social workers doing the work of up to seven people in another jurisdiction. The system is creaking,” he added.Prof Crown said the HSE is “top heavy with bureaucrats. There are too many of them. It over complicates things. There is a grotesque shortage of doctors, we are vastly below international averages.”Phil Ní Sheaghdha, the INMO general secretary, said that real issue is that there is not a winter plan in place and that rosters are completely depleted with a growing reliance on agencies and overtime. She pointed out that there are 227 fewer nurses working in the Irish health care system now than there were in December last year.Last month the IMO predicted Ireland’s hospitals face another chaotic winter with the number of patients on trolleys set to exceed 1,000 in a single day.And earlier this week details of a HSE review of how hospitals coped last winter found a sustained surge in the numbers attending hospitals, insufficient bed capacity, staff recruitment and retention problems as well as a prolonged flu season and extreme weather all contributed to unprecedented overcrowding.The HSE analysis, completed in recent days, said special funding to address the pressures effectively came too late in the year to be of optimal use. While the review by the HSE said special funding for dealing with winter pressures in the health service should be agreed in the summer, the executive’s final plan for this winter will only be submitted to the Department of Health in the coming days."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Group of GPs concerned with plans to begin abortion services in less than two monthsRules have been approved by Government and apply to all children\u0026rsquos residential centresMinister says apprentice training \u0026lsquoCinderella\u0026rsquo of career options but an exciting job choiceConsultant says Taoiseach is denying frontline emergency staff their \u0026lsquonecessary R\u0026ampR\u0026rsquoAdditional personnel welcomed as \u0026lsquoreal political support for Garda oversight\u0026rsquoCommission on Future of Policing queried on plans during last public engagement\u0026euro180,000 was sought by the driver and the two passengers of carResearch shows leaving work to care for children results in much lower wages later in lifeClarity needed for British commercial vehicle operators to \u0026lsquokeep trade flowing freely\u0026rsquoRemains of Michal Waskiewiczwere discovered near Christ Church CathedralProtest planned outside St Luke\u0026rsquos national school over threats posed by remedial worksMother of girl who became pregnant at 15 facing a trial and could be jailed for up to five yearsWoman believes deceased told her cries for help heard from street were \u0026lsquoa joke\u0026rsquo after she came to his doorUnity could benefit Ireland by more than \u0026euro23 billion up to 2025, researchers claimIrish Heart Foundation campaign calls on industry to stop targeting children with unhealthy productsQuarry owners argued that injured party made false statement in original claimOne parent attending a meeting with a teacher and a principal used a smartphone to record the meeting, later putting it online"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3689487.1541596053!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit varadkar sets out second condition for review of backstop","story":"A fiery exchange between Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald took place in the Dail as Varadkar defended his remarks that he is open to considering a review clause in the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar with Finland’s Prime Minister Juha Sipila (right)  at the Prime Minister’s official residence in Helsinki. Photograph: Antti Aimo-KoivistoLehtikuva via APTaoiseach Leo Vardakar has set out a second key condition for acceptance by Ireland of any Brexit backstop review mechanism currently being proposed by the UK. The review mechanism discussion is understood to be critical to breaking the talks impasse ahead of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union in March 2019. Speaking in Helsinki, Finland on Wednesday, Mr Varadkar said any review mechanism could not be unilateral on the part of the UK. Secondly, he said it would have to be based on a sufficiently ambitious “future relationship” agreement being in place to “achieve the same objective, which is that there be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.”Theresa May’s cabinet could meet later this week to sign off on a proposal for the review mechanism to determine how Britain could exit a backstop after Brexit. Mrs May told ministers on Tuesday that she wanted a withdrawal deal with the EU as soon as possible but not at any price. EU negotiators believe there must be movement on the backstop by the end of this week if there is to be a special summit to approve the withdrawal deal before the end of this month.Britain has previously committed to having a backstop in place which would act as an insurance policy in the event of a no-deal Brexit so that the Irish border stays open. During a cabinet meeting that lasted almost three hours, every minister contributed to a discussion of the Brexit negotiations which focused on the backstop. Attorney general Geoffrey Cox described the EU’s willingness to consider a review mechanism for the backstop as a “major step” towards a deal.Mr Cox is understood to have told ministers that a mechanism based on mutual consent could offer Britain the same certainty as a unilateral mechanism favoured by Brexit secretary Dominic Raab. Mr Varadkar, who spoke to Mrs May about a review mechanism on Monday, has ruled out a unilateral option. Wednesday’s intervention by Mr Varadkar that any review can only be taken in the context of another agreement that guarantees the same outcome as the backstop may prove to be a further stumbling block in reaching a withdrawal deal by the end of November. Mr Varadkar said the review mechanism “can’t be one that would allow the UK to resile unilaterally from its commitment that there should be no hard border in Ireland. His comments set a high bar for any future relationship agreement. Mr Varadkar, echoed by the Finnish Prime Minister and a growing consensus on the talks timeline, also said that it was now more likely that a deal on the Brexit withdrawal agreement would be done ahead of the December summit. “I do think that every day that passes,” he said,”the possibility of getting a special summit in November becomes less likely but we do have one scheduled anyway for the 13th of December. “So not getting it done in November doesn’t mean we can’t get it done in the first two weeks of December, but beyond that we’d be into the New Year but that wouldn’t be a good thing.” The Taoiseach is in Helsinki for the conference of the European People’s Party to which Fine Gael is affiliated. The conference, attended by over 2,000 delegates and many EPP heads of state is due on Wednesday to agree to the party’s candidate for the Commission presidency for the European Parliament elections next year. Mr Varadkar held a bilateral with Finland’s Prime Minister Juha Sipila in the latter’s scenic, shoreside residence, Kesaranta, and spoke to journalists after the meeting. Speaking on the negotiations on the backstop and the nature of a proposed review process, Mr Varadkar said that “For me it’s always about the objective – what are you trying to achieve. What we’re trying to achieve is a guarantee that a hard border won’t emerge between Northern Ireland and Ireland and the backstop is part of that. “We hope that the backstop will never need to be used. It is an insurance policy and we hope that if it has to be used it will only be temporary, but in order for the backstop to be a backstop if it is ever invoked it must apply unless and until a new agreement supersedes it and achieves the same objective which is that there be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. “And that’s a commitment that was there from December ... and now we need to get that written into the text in the withdrawal agreement,” the Taoiseach said. Asked if he would have difficulty urging voters next year to back the party of Hungary’s Viktor Orban or Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi, Mr Varadkar insisted that all European parties were broad churches, “umbrella parties”. Fianna Fáil’s Liberal group – “ strange that FF is in the Liberal group, but they are” — after all includes the Czech ANO “with policies very similar to Mr Orban in Hungary and of course many of the people in the social democratic parties used to be car-carrying and practising communists ....” “I’m not asking people to vote for these parties when people vote in the European elections in Ireland,” Mr Varadkar said, “I’m asking them to vote for Fine Gael and for the EPP, to vote for our policies and values of the EPP ... liberal democracy, Christian democracy... We are the people who saw off communism in Europe and saw off fascism .”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

These two-way traders make up around 18 per cent of firms, but accounted for over 60 percent of exports and over 70 per cent of imports,” Mr Leheny said.According to the FTA this means the percentage of intermediate products in all imports from Northern Ireland to the Republic is higher compared to almost every other sector than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK.“For example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain.“Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border,” Mr Leheny added.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

A meeting has been organised by some of the people involved with community groups only. They have picked special people to go into it,” he said.He added that “as a local Deputy, I was not even asked”.Mr Murphy accused the Government of “doing this under a secret type of cover” and he asked why the communities were not being approached.He insisted that “communities will take on this challenge and support those people. “The people who are bringing this in are saying we are going to have extra teachers in the school and extra support for the doctors, but these things are not happening.”He said that had not happened in Ballaghaderreen, despite promises, when a refurbished hotel was turned into a centre for Syrian refugees.“Communities are prepared to support these people but I appeal to the Government to give back-up to communities to help and assist them.”Responding for the Government, Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed acknowledged that “the community in Roscommon has previously extended a céad míle fáilte to people in direct provision centres”.He said he was not aware of the specific case Mr Murphy was raising but would bring it to the attention of the Minister for Justice and ask him to communicate directly with the TD.The Department of Justice confirmed in July that it would not renew its contract with the hotel housing the Ballaghaderreen reception centre for refugees which expires in December 2019 but would not specify the reasons for ending the agreement.Refugees who come to Ireland under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) are housed in Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres at the Abbeyfield Hotel in Ballaghaderreen, Hazel Hotel in Monasterevin and Clonea Strand in Dungarvan. Some IRPP refugees have also been housed in the Mosney direct provision centre in Co Meath."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3689760.1541610049!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach urged to apologise to frontline health staff over christmas leave insult","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was urged in the Dáil to apologise publicly to hospital personnel over his remarks on them taking extended leave over Christmas.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was accused of engaging in a vindictive attempt to shift the blame for hospital overcrowding from the Government to frontline staff.Sinn Féin foreign affairs spokesman David Cullinane made the claim in the Dáil on Wednesday as Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin called on Mr Varadkar to apologise publicly to hospital personnel over his remarks to the Dáil on Tuesday.The Taoiseach had attributed emergency department difficulties to staff being on holidays over the Christmas and new year period, including the first two weeks of January.On Tuesday he was warned 100,000 people would have waited on trolleys by the end of this year and questioned about why a winter health plan had yet to be published this year instead of being agreed in the summer.Mr Varadkar said that hospitals were effectively closed for seven of the 12 days of Christmas and New Year between December 22nd and January 3rd next.Mr Martin said the Taoiseach insulted hospital staff working at the frontline. He referred to Mr Varadkar’s remarks that winter plans for the past 10 to 15 years had been useless, and pointed out that they included plans the Taoiseach had published when he was minister for health as well as others from Fine Gael ministers.He accused the Taoiseach of effectively saying that staff did not turn up.“You declared in a narky response that it was all the nurses’ fault, it was the consultants’ fault. It was classic ‘blame someone else’,” Mr Martin said.“When is the apology going to come and when will the winter plan be published?” Mr Martin asked.Mr Cullinane said nurses and doctors’ leave was not the problem. “It does not contribute to hospital overcrowding. The problem is capacity in our public health services.”Labour party leader Brendan Howlin said the Taoiseach should not blame health staff for taking annual leave to which they were entitled. He pointed out that staff rosters were a management issue, which “should have been addressed by constructive engagement with unions, and not by abusing staff on the airwaves or in the House”.People Before Profit TD Bríd Smith sharply criticised the pay and conditions for hospital nurses. She said industrial action is a real possibility as nurses ballot on the issue.Ms Smith said that if the Government could not deal now with nurses’ low pay and with ambulance service issues, “then I suggest the Cabinet doesn’t take a Christmas holiday and works hard over the holiday period to ensure these issues are settled”.Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed said efforts were continuing to engage with nursing unions on pay, recruitment and retention of staff.He also said it was wrong to accuse the Taoiseach of blaming doctors or nurses. He was speaking on behalf of Mr Varadkar who is in Finland for talks on Brexit.“The Taoiseach didn’t blame doctors or nurses. He said it was appropriate that there should be a critical mass of doctors and nurses on duty, and support services including laboratories, at the most challenging time for the health services,” Mr Creed said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3689895.1541626088!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"calls for may to publish attorney general s advice on backstop","story":"Theresa May’s government is under growing pressure to publish its legal advice on a backstop deal as ministers are expected to meet in the next few days to approve it. Conservative Brexiteers have joined Labour, the DUP and the Liberal Democrats in calling for the advice given to the prime minister by attorney general Geoffrey Cox to be made public.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said it was essential that MPs should be given the opportunity to scrutinise the attorney general’s legal advice before voting on the final Brexit deal.“The public have the right to know precisely what the cabinet has signed up to and what the implications are for the future,” he said.The cabinet is expected to meet either this weekend or early next week to sign off on a deal on the Brexit withdrawal agreement, including a new proposal for a review mechanism that would determine when the backstop is no longer necessary. On Wednesday afternoon, ministers were invited into the cabinet office to read the full text of the draft withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland. \u0026nbsp“It’s a great document,” environment secretary Michael Gove told Sky News as he left the building after reading it.At Tuesday’s cabinet meeting, Mr Cox gave ministers a summary of his legal opinion on rival options for a review mechanism.He is understood to have warned that seeking a unilateral mechanism, as favoured by Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, heightened the risk of a no-deal Brexit but to have acknowledged that a mutual consent mechanism risked leaving Britain subject to the backstop for longer than it wished.DUP chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson said his party would like to see the full advice published before parliament’s “meaningful vote” on the Brexit deal.“It’s in the public interest that we understand fully what is happening here. We’ve had that commitment already from the government, that they will tell us what the legal advice they have is in relation to the backstop,” he told the BBC. \u0026nbsp“If the House of Commons is going to have a meaningful vote on a deal upon which this legal advice is very important, then I think people are entitled to know what that legal advice is.” \u0026nbspFormer Brexit secretary David Davis called last Sunday for the legal advice to be published and veteran Conservative eurosceptic Bill Cash on Wednesday joined the call for it to be made public.“The attorney general’s advice on critical constitutional issues is for parliament and the country, not just for the government,” he said.Governments do not usually publish legal advice, although Tony Blair gave the House of Lords a summary of his legal advice ahead of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. It emerged later that the summary did not accurately reflect the nuanced nature of the attorney general’s advice.\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Getty ImagesSome campaigns have broken barriers this election, with historic candidates changing the face of Congress and statehouses across the US. Women have run in record numbers, and Native Americans, Muslims, Latinos, immigrants, millennials and LGBT candidates have already made history with their campaigns.Here are the key trailblazing candidates who are ersifying American politics and have already won their races so far.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, youngest woman elected to Congress Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s surprise victory in the June congressional primary in New York shook up Washington and the Democratic party. The progressive challenger and member of the Democratic socialist party unseated a powerful 10-term New York congressman, running with a campaign ad that said: “Women like me aren’t supposed to run for office.”Now age 29, she has become the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Elise Stefanik previously held the record when she was elected to Congress at age 30 in 2014.Ocasio-Cortez is the daughter of a Puerto Rican mother and a Bronx-born father and grew up in a working-class community. She ran a grassroots campaign that took on the “Queens Democratic party machine” and championed progressive proposals, such as the abolition of the Immigration Customs Enforcement (Ice), a single-payer healthcare plan and tuition-free college.Ayanna Pressley, first black House member from Massachusetts Pressley was the first black woman to serve on Boston’s city council and made history again after defeating the 10-term incumbent Michael Capuano in the primary. She did not face a challenger in the general election, making her the first black member of the House of Representatives from Massachusetts.In her victory speech in September, she said: “These times demanded more from our leaders and from our party. These times demanded an approach to governing that was bold, uncompromising and unafraid. It’s not just good enough to see the Democrats back in power but it matters who those Democrats are.”Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, first Muslim congresswomen Tlaib ran unopposed in her race to represent Michigan’s 17th district and has become the nation’s first Palestinian-American woman in Congress, and one of two Muslim women elected on Tuesday.She is a Democratic-Socialist who served on the state legislature from 2009 to 2014 and ran her congressional primary campaign supporting Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage and abolishing ICE. Tlaib was famously escorted from a Trump rally in 2016 as she shouted questions at the candidate, asking him if he had ever read the constitution.Ilhan Omar, also the first Somali-American in Congress, is a former refugee who spent the last four years as a state legislator. There, she pushed a progressive agenda, including a $15 minimum wage and subsidizing higher education costs for low-income students.Her congressional platform has included the cancellation of student debt, banning private prisons and aggressive funding cuts to military spending. In 2016, she became the first Somali-American state legislator in the country.Jared Polis, first openly gay man elected governor As the Democratic nominee for governor in Colorado, Polis ran on a leftwing platform, which included single-payer healthcare, repeal of the death penalty, universal full-day preschool and stronger gun laws. Polis, who declared victory late Tuesday night, has long been outspoken in favor of marijuana legalisation.Kate Brown, who is bisexual, became the first openly LGBT person elected governor in 2016 when she won her Oregon race. Jim McGreevey, a Democrat and former New Jersey governor, came out while in office in 2004.Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland, first Native American congresswoman An attorney and former MMA fighter, Davids became the first Native American congresswoman and the first lesbian congresswoman from Kansas.Raised by a single mother army veteran and a member of the Wisconsin-based Ho-Chunk Nation, Davids was a fellow in the Obama White House.Deb Haaland is a citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe. In New Mexico, Deb Haaland became the first Native American woman to chair a state political party. Now, the former Democratic chair has also become the first Native American congresswoman in the US, alongside Davids. A citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe, Haaland is a longtime activist who ran on a progressive platform, including Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, and the impeachment of Trump.Marsha Blackburn, first female senator from Tennessee A Republican who represents Tennessee’s 7th congressional district, Blackburn has become the first female senator in the state.Her race received national attention after the pop star Taylor Swift, who previously avoided politics, endorsed Blackburn’s opponent, the Democratic former governor Phil Bredesen. Blackburn has been closely aligned with Trump and is farther to the right than the GOP senator she is replacing. – Will there be a backlash against Trump?

Photograph: New York TimesTuesday’s US congressional elections ended with what might be called a split decision. Democrats gained more than enough seats to take control of the U.S. House of Representatives, but lost ground to Republicans in the US Senate and came up short in some key governor’s races.Seven takeaways from the evening:1) The urban-rural ide is as pervasive as ever. Democrats, as expected, won in suburban congressional districts in places such as Virginia and Pennsylvania. But they were hammered in Senate races in rural states, losing seats in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota. The party still is struggling to connect with blue-collar, white voters.2) President Donald Trump remains an inescapable political force. Democrats credit Trump’s unpopularity among women, minorities, young people and suburban voters with college degrees for their House wins. Republicans said his late-stage campaign efforts helped them pick up seats in the Senate. The president showed he remains popular in presidential swing states including Florida and Ohio. 3) Progressive stars had a tough night. Beto O’Rourke lost in Texas, Andrew Gillum in Florida and Richard Cordray in Ohio. None of them broke through, despite the enthusiasm they generated nationally. That means progressive candidates may have a tough time gaining traction in the scrum for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.4) Republicans held off a blue wave in governors’ races. Trump-backed Ron DeSantis won in Florida, Mike DeWine took Ohio, Kim Reynolds won in Iowa. All three states are key presidential battlegrounds.5) The Republican Party is more Trumpian than ever. Gone are Republican Trump critics in the Senate such as Bob Corker and Jeff Flake who are retiring. Also gone are Republican moderates in the House like Virginia’s Barbara Comstock and Colorado’s Mike Coffman who tried to keep some distance from the president but lost their races on Tuesday. Most of the remaining Republican congressional caucus is on board.6) Wedge issues raised late in the campaign helped Republicans. The party was struggling to find ways to engage its base until Senate Democrats rose up against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. All three of the Democratic senators who voted for Trump’s first high court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and then turned around and voted against Kavanaugh lost their seats. Trump’s continuing focus on the migrant caravan in Mexico turned out to be an issue that helped power some surprise wins in the Senate, but may have contributed to defeats in the House.7) Democrats had big success in the Great Lakes. The party held onto Senate seats in states in the industrial Midwest that Trump won in 2016. Wisconsin’s Tammy Baldwin, Ohio’s Sherrod Brown, Pennsylvania’s Bob Casey and Michigan’s Debbie Stabenow never faced a serious challenge from their Trump-backed opponents – a positive sign for the party heading into the 2020 presidential campaign. – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"halloween celebrations costumes around world pictures","story":"Around 2000 people gathered on the streets of Kawasaki, Japan, to watch the country\u0027s largest Halloween parade on Saturday 28th October.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

However, he was either been removed from class for his own welfare or because it is believed he may be in the wrong year.It has been reported that the pair are brothers and at their home in the city.Asked about the younger brother, a school spokeswoman said: “A student in Year 7 is also not currently attending school.“We cannot comment further on inidual cases but we have followed Government and local authority policies and guidance, as we do for any admissions matter.“We are continuing to liaise with the authorities on this. We have informed parents of the situation and will continue to keep them updated as we receive information.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Home Office does not routinely comment on inidual cases. Where there are concerns that an inidual may not be a minor as claimed, the Home Office’s policy is to ask social services to complete a full age assessment.”Commuters spending more than an hour to travel to work up by a third in less than a decadeElectric scooters could be allowed on Britain’s roads for first time as government plans to change lawDark Heart, episode 3, review: this gory crime drama has taken on a Brexity vibeGrand Designs: House of the Year, review: homes to drool over (or sneer at)US midterm elections live: Donald Trump\u0026#39s Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigns  - latest news and reactionAsia Bibi freed from jail after eight years on death row for blasphemyComment: Boys can\u0026#39t be left to raise themselves - we need to give them the protection, hierarchy and structure gangs offerComment: Success at a priceQueen Victoria\u0026#39s tiny mourning dress goes on display for first time Self-driving cars could function as moving brothels, academics predictSuicides spike on Monday mornings, according to new study in Japan\u0026#39Split decision\u0026#39: How US newspapers reacted to the midterm electionsComment: The five new rules turning Western politics on its headDutch man, 69, who \u0026#39identifies as 20 years younger\u0026#39 launches legal battle to change ageTrusts allowing families to pay less inheritance tax could be reformed by HMRC Fewer than 1 in 100 theft offences are being solved by police, analysis shows as police criticised over prioritiesComment: In Trump\u0026#39s America, culture beats the economy at the pollsTheresa May shows Cabinet proposed Brexit withdrawal agreement but ministers demand to see legal advice behind itGrand Designs houses: what happened next? Scottish Parliament backs second EU referendum in vote exposing SNP and Labour isionsEU migrants aged between 18 and 30 will be able to come to Britain under post-Brexit visa schemeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"split decision us newspapers reacted midterm elections","story":"The Wall Street Journal and the New York Daily NewsThe Democrats took back the House but the Republicans strengthened their majority in the Senate - a mixed bag of results that were reflected on the country\u0027s front pages on Wednesday. Ending eight years of Republican control that began with the tea party revolt of 2010, Democrats picked off more than two dozen GOP-held districts in suburbs across the nation on the way to securing the 218 seats needed for a majority.As of early Wednesday, two dozen races had yet to be decided, meaning the majority could grow still larger.With the Republicans keeping control of the Senate, the outcome in the House could mean gridlock for Mr Trump\u0027s agenda on Capitol Hill - or, conversely, it could open a new era of deal-making.Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is seeking to reclaim the gavel as House speaker, called it a new day in America, while Mr Trump rejoiced at the Republicans\u0027 tremendous success. The outcome was summed up by many headlines on the front pages of US newspapers The Wall Street Journal called it a Split decision, with the paper\u0027s editorial concluding: America’s deep political isions revealed themselves again on Tuesday, as Democrats regained control of the U.S. House while Republicans picked up seats in the Senate. Add their gains in the statehouses, and it was a better night overall for the Democrats, if less than the “blue wave” they advertised.In its editorial, the Washington Post declared it a Great day for democracy. The Democrats’ return to control over the House of Representatives is much more than a victory for one party. It is a sign of health for American democracy. The New York Times said the Democrats\u0027 capture of the House will give them the opportunity to show that there’s a better model of legislating, that Congress is capable of doing more for Americans than cutting taxes for the wealthy and menacing everyone else’s health care.Now and again Democratic leaders may need to play constitutional hardball — and they’ll have a chance to do it in a more constructive fashion than Mitch McConnell and his team, who have dominated Congress since 2014, it said.The New York Daily News reflected the mixed results with the cheeky headline: Split happens.And in Colorado, the Denver Post hailed the victory of Jared Polis, who became the nation\u0027s first openly gay governor.Typically blue New Jersey saw a tight race between Democrat incumbent Bob Menendez, who fended off a challenge from Bob Hugin. Mr Hugin sought to distance himself from Mr Trump, something the president suggested was behind his defeat on Wednesday.The Boston Herald focused on the Democrats regaining control of the House of Representatives.The Texas senate race went down to the wire, with Democrats hoping Beto O\u0027Rourke could achieve the near-impossible and turn the state blue.

which he portrayed in epic terms.Republicans increased their seats in the Senate – they now have 51 seats out of 100, after Democrats\u0027 dreams of the Senate majority, always unlikely, were shattered by losses in key battlegrounds: Indiana, Missouri, Tennessee, North Dakota and Texas.But they lost control of the House of Representatives, meaning that Mr Trump\u0027s legislative agenda will likely be thwarted, and his policies face far greater scrutiny.In an astonishingly combative 90 minute press conference the president delighted in the defeat of candidates from his own party, who had distanced themselves from him.He singled out Carlos Curbelo, a moderate Republican from Florida, and Mia Love, a Republican from Utah.Mia Love gave me no love, then she lost, he said. Sorry about that Mia. Too bad.The president praised his own leadership, saying his gaining seats in the Senate had been historic, and a feat not achieved since John F Kennedy in the 1960s.House of Representatives - US mid term election results barAsked about the violence that preceded the election, with the pipe bombing campaign and the Pittsburg shooting, he was unrepentant, saying: I am a great moral leader.He angrily denied questions asking whether his embrace of nationalism had emboldened white nationalists, and he sparred repeatedly with reporters, who ganged together to defend each other in the face of Mr Trump\u0027s insults.One CNN reporter was told he was a disgrace to your network, and an African American reporter for PBS was told her question was racist and insulting.The Republicans held the Senate after the midtermsAmid all the hostility, however, he did hold out an olive branch to the Democrats who now control the House, saying that he felt they could work together.He heaped praise on Nancy Pelosi, tipped to be the Speaker of the House, and said the results were positive for the United States.Now is the time to put partisanship aside, he said.And we should come together to celebrate the American economic miracle - because it is a miracle.Asked what he had learnt from the midterms, he replied: I think people like me. I think people like the job I\u0027m doing, frankly.Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, said the firing of Mr Sessions appears to be a blatant attempt by Mr Trump to undermine and end the Russia probe.Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, is due to arrive at the White House any minute. There were reports earlier this year that Mr Trump was on the verge of firing him, after it emerged that he had joked about recording the president. Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, has resigned. Mr Sessions has repeatedly provoked the ire of Donald Trump after recusing himself from the federal investigation into potential Russian collusion in the presidential election.Mr Trump blamed the decision for opening the door to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, who took over the Russia investigation and began examining whether Mr Trump\u0027s hectoring of his chief law enforcement officer was part of a broader effort to obstruct justice.Mr Trump announced in a tweet that Mr Sessions\u0027 chief of staff, Matthew G Whitaker, will serve as acting Attorney General.In his resignation letter, Mr Sessions made clear he was standing down at the president\u0027s request. Mr Whitaker, who is expected to temporarily oversee the Russia probe, has previously suggested that a replacement to Mr Sessions could slash Mr Mueller’s budget so the investigation grinds to almost a halt.   I don\u0027t do that. I have never used racist remarks.Omarosa Manigault-Newman, pictured with Donald Trump in November 2015Why do I have my highest poll numbers ever with African Americans?It\u0027s insulting to me.Critics accuse the Trump administration of supporting white nationalism - something he has vehemently deniedI think I am a great moral leader.Donald Trump, campaigning in IndianaDonald Trump is asked about the violence that preceded the vote - the pipe bombs, the Pittsburg shooting.You have to fight all the time, when you are being misrepresented by the media.I would love to see peace, and unity, and any other word you want to use. If they would cover me fairly - I don\u0027t say that in a hostile way - but I do something and they say it\u0027s not good. Donald Trump is asked yet again about the future of John Kelly, and his Cabinet members.He jokes that people get exhausted, and he understands them wanting to leave.He says you come into the White House, serve for a short period of time, and emerge years older...John Kelly, the White House chief of staffAs I understand it we\u0027re having a lunch with numerous countries (in Paris this weekend).I believe Putin will be there.I don\u0027t think anything has been scheduled.I\u0027ll be going there.We\u0027ll be very shortly meeting at the G20.We will be having a lunch, but there will be other people here.Trump and Putin, pictured a year agoDonald Trump is asked whether he has seen any meddling in the election.He stunned the UN general assembly in September when he announced that they had evidence of China attempting to influence the midterms.Donald Trump at the UN in September, where he said that China had meddled in the midtermsBut he doesn\u0027t say whether they have seen any attempts to damage the process.We\u0027re going to make a full report. And unlike the previous administration, we\u0027re going to make a full report.We\u0027ve been working very hard.Trump is asked why he doesn\u0027t put an end to the Mueller investigation.I could, he says. I could fire everyone right now.I stay away from it. I let it go on.But you\u0027re right, I could say that investigation is over.It\u0027s an embarrassment to our country, to the people of our country, and it\u0027s a disgrace.I think people like me. I think people like the job I\u0027m doing, frankly.Donald Trump, taking questions in the East WingHe\u0027s asked about the Mueller investigation.I think it\u0027s bad for our country. I think it\u0027s a shame.A poll came out today - I think on MSNBC - showing that the majority of people disapprove with the investigation. They think it\u0027s bad for our country.They need people who are fair - not the Angry Democrats.Forget about unfair to me - it\u0027s unfair for the country.Robert Mueller, leading the Russia investigationHe says he has no regrets of describing the caravan as an invasion.I want them to come into the country, but I want them to come in legally. We have a process.We have hundreds of companies moving in, and we need the workers.He is asked about the campaign advert which was so isive even Fox News refused to air it.Do you think they were actors? They didn\u0027t come from Hollywood.I think you should let me run the country, you run CNN.Jim Acosta, the CNN correspondent, who regularly spars with the presidentHe then turns on CNN\u0027s reporter, Jim Acosta.CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person. The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is disgraceful. Just sit down please. When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.In news which will cause sleepless nights for Jeff Sessions, maybe Wilbur Ross, he replies:I\u0027d rather not answer that.Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, is believed to have his fate hanging in the balanceHe is asked whether John Kelly will stay on as chief of staff, and replies that it\u0027s normal to have a shake-up after the midterms.For the most past I\u0027m happy with the Cabinet.Is Ryan Zinke, his scandal-hit interior secretary, safe?We\u0027re looking at that. I want to study what\u0027s being said. We\u0027ll have an answer for you in about a week.I speak to Democrats all the time, and they agree that a wall is necessary.Now we have the military. Now we have other elements.I\u0027d like to see the wall.Many of the people we are dealing with - in 2006 they approved the wall, essentially.We need it. We have people coming through the border - and I don\u0027t just mean the caravan.You couldn\u0027t put people along it - tremendous fighting would ensue.Their whole agenda has been to try and not give me anything for the wall. But I actually believe they are hurting themselves politically.There are a lot of things we could do together.Donald Trump speaking on WednesdayHe raises the possibility of infrastructure reform, and says that he plans on sending something up there that Democrats can support, and sending something up there that Republicans can support.Now is the time to put partisanship aside.And we should come together to celebrate the American economic miracle - because it is a miracle.Our steel industry, our mining industry was dead. Support our law enforcement. Advance our great policy - including environmental policy. We want crystal clean water and beautiful clean air. It has to be perfect.At the same time we don\u0027t want to put ourselves at a disadvantage.Environmental is very important to me.He singles out Carlos Curbelo (who lost his seat as representative for Florida) and Mia Love (who lost her seat as representative for Utah).She kept calling me about a hostage situation in Venezuela.But Mia Love gave me no love, then she lost. Sorry about that Mia. Too bad.He continues naming them - Republicans who turned on him. It\u0027s quite a remarkable scene.They decided not to embrace me, or what we stand for.But what we stand for meant a lot to most people.At 93 per cent, it\u0027s a record. We\u0027ve had tremendous support. America is booming like never before.It was a big day yesterday - an incredible day. Last night the Republican party defied history to expand our Senate majority, and did better than expected in the House.He says they did so against staggering opposition.Donald Trump campaigning in Tennessee on Sunday He says his 30 rallies in the last 60 days helped - the candidates I supported achieved tremendous success.Of 11 candidates he campaigned with in the last week, nine won, he says.History really will see what a good job we did in the final couple of weeks, in terms of getting some tremendous people across the finish line.This election marks the first gain since at least President Kennedy\u0027s in 1962.As of now we picked up, it looks like three - it could be four, it could be two. Fifty five is the largest number of Republican Senators in the last 100 years. In the last 80 years, it has averaged one per decade. In Obama\u0027s first midterm election he lost six Senate seats.He then lists his wins - Indiana, Florida, North Dakota - and singles out Tennessee and Utah.He continues: In the House, Republicans are looking really good, despite a large number of retirements.He praises people who worked very, very hard - like Oprah Winfrey, who I like. She may not like me, but that\u0027s OK.Trump and Oprah - opposite political sides- he was due to start at 11:30am.It\u0027s now 11:50am, and the East Room of the White House is packed with people. Everyone is waiting.Ah, Ivanka - ever the diplomat...Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Senate, has had a good night.His party\u0027s grip has increased - 96 of the 100 seats have been declared, and 51 are now Republican, 41 Democrat (with two independent). Before Tuesday, 43 were Democrat.He\u0027s asked if he\u0027s worried that the Democrats in the House will use their new majority to cause trouble for Mr Trump.Mitch McConnell, leader of the Republicans in the SenateWe tried that with Bill Clinton.The Democrats will have to decide how much presidential harassment is a good strategy. I\u0027m not sure it\u0027ll work for them.I\u0027m not making recommendations. Just a historical observation.If the issue of presidential harassment which we were engaged in in the late 1990s is any guide. He\u0027s asked what impact he feels Trump\u0027s rhetoric has had, and dismisses the question.I\u0027m not going to have us waste our time on routine questions about what the president may say at any moment. I\u0027m here to talk about the Senate.I\u0027m proud of what happened, and the president was very helpful to us.And he outlines his concerns for the next session, which begins in January.Mitch McConnell with other congressional leaders and Donald Trump, inside the White HouseHe stresses that they have a lot of work still to do in this session.There are serious problems with Obamacare - serious problems - and they need to get fixed.I think all of our candidates, who subsequently won, were able to make it clear that they wanted to cover pre-existing conditions.We are going to have to work together in a bipartisan way to make changes.Healthcare is still a crisis. And it needs to be fixed.We need to do a better job with women candidates, and get them elected.So what will he do now?My top priority is the judiciary - the president has done an excellent job of picking young men and women who believe the job is to follow the law, and we will keep confirming.I can\u0027t imagine with all the things we have to do, to wrap up this congress, we will tackle immigration. But who knows?It seems that no matter who is up or who is down, we can\u0027t come to an agreement on the situation.I can\u0027t imagine we will try to do anything other than the funding of the wall in this session.He referred to the question of birthright citizenship as an interesting legal question.Senator Bill Nelson\u0027s campaign has announced that his race against his Republican challenger Rick Scott, the current governor of Florida, is headed to a recount.Of the 8.1 million votes cast, Mr Scott leads by just 34,537 votes, which is less than one-half point, the threshold for a state-mandated recount.Bill Nelson, the Senator for Florida hoping for re-election, is seeking a recount after results showed his rival Rick Scott to have clinched victory by the narrowest of marginsWe are proceeding to a recount, said Mr Nelson in a statement.The three-term Democratic senator released a statement at 1am ET on Wednesday morning announcing that he was disappointed in the election night results.Now, all of Florida\u0027s 67 counties need to recheck tally totals.The deadline for the process is noon on November 10.We are still waiting for all the votes to be counted, but it\u0027s believed that 113 million people voted yesterday.That is 49 per cent turnout - high for a midterm.In 2014, 83.3 million went to the polls.The previous high was in 2010, when 96.5 million voted to deliver their verdict on Barack Obama\u0027s first two years.Absolutely not - despite what he\u0027s likely to say in the next few hours.Having oversight from Congress - something he is not really used to - is likely to prove a shock. And, if you see my colleague Ben Riley-Smith\u0027s tweet (12:40pm), there is a daunting list of damaging proposals being drawn up.With the midterms out the way, there is some speculation that Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, could also make some significant moves.Robert Mueller is expected to increase the pace of his investigation, now the midterms are out the wayMaggie Haberman, the White House correspondent for The New York Times, also thinks that many of the Trump Team may not want to weather the coming storms.Who could be leaving?John Kelly, chief of staffWilbur Ross, secretary of commerceIt\u0027s a sign that he realises he needs to maintain relationships with her she wields a lot of power.She is the senior Democrat in the House, and likely to be elected as Speaker.Nancy Pelosi at an election night party in WashingtonIt was a big night for Texas, with Beto O\u0027Rourke\u0027s attempt to unseat Ted Cruz in the Senate dominating national headlines.The hype got people to the polls.Beto O\u0026#39Rourke playing alongside his band at  Willie Nelson\u0026#39s 45th Fourth Of July Picnic, in AustinThe Texas Tribune reports that turnout this year topped eight million — which is near presidential election levels.In the 2014 midterm, for example, just 4.6 million Texans showed up to the polls.In 2016 - a presidential election year - nearly nine million Texans voted.By the end of early voting this year, turnout in the 30 Texas counties that are home to 78 per cent of the state’s registered voters had already surpassed turnout from the 2012 presidential election.Just in from Bookmakers.tv - they think the money is on Beto O\u0027Rourke for 2020, despite his failing to beat Ted Cruz in the race for the Senate.Beto O\u0026#39Rourke, with his wife Amy, concedes defeat in TexasBeto O’Rourke emerges as standout Democrat candidate for 2020 and is now the main threat to Trump following energised campaign in Texas, as he’s the clear second favourite behind Trump in 2020 betting and strong favourite in Democratic candidate race.Democrats has nudge ahead of Republicans in 2020 winner betting, now 45 (from evens), becoming clear favourites for the first time.One of the most interesting things to watch will be how Donald Trump copes with having a hostile House.Until now the House has been controlled by Republicans, who have helped him along. That\u0027s all changed.One of the ways he may try to get around that is through the use of executive orders. Mr Trump loves them - signing them with great pomp and ceremony even when they are not necessary (as with the ending of the child separation policy - that didn\u0027t need an executive order, but he signed one anyway, in a televised performance).Our data journalist Patrick Scott has pulled together the statistics on his use of executive orders.Executive Orders signed per year in officeFor the first time in American political history a congressional election is poised to go to a run off. In sparsely populated northern Maine  neither Republican Bruce Poliquin nor Democrat Jared Golden secured more than 50 per cent of the vote.The outcome will be decided on voters’ second preferences. This is because Maine’s electorate backed the introduction of a system known as Ranked Choice Voting in a referendum in 2016.A guest at a Republican election night party in IndianapolisMr Poliquin has refused to rule out challenging the result should he lose in the run off despite having won more votes than his opponent on the first preferences. As things stand he polled 46.1 per cent and Mr Golden 45.8 per cent. Despite its remoteness, the district is of some additional interest because Maine is one of two states - the other is Nebraska - which splits the presidential electoral college vote. Northern Maine went for Donald Trump in 2016.Tuesday\u0027s midterm elections marked two years since Donald Trump\u0027s shock election victory – the first test of how his Republican party is faring in the eyes of the American public.The midterms is the name given to the combination of elections for the US Congress, governorships and other state-wide races that take place every two years.Before Tuesday, Republicans controlled the House of Representativesand the Senate – the two chambers which make up the US Congress. But a so-called “blue wave” saw Democrats poised to take control of the House.A liberal base hoping to derail Mr Trump\u0027s agenda has energised activists in key races, out-fundraising and out-polling a host of Republican incumbents.Although Mr Trump is not on the ballot, in many ways the results will be seen as a referendum on his accomplishments and how voters feel about the US president.The battle for Georgia governor was one of the toughest, and nastiest, in the country.Stacey Abrams is hoping to become the first black woman to govern a US state.Stacey Abrams, campaigning in Georgia. She is still hoping to force her rival into a run-offAt 5am ET (10am UK) 99 per cent of the votes have been counted, but Abrams is refusing to concede - she wants to wait until all the absentee ballots are counted.Under state law in Georgia, the leading candidate must receive more than 50 per cent of the vote to avoid a runoff electionGiven the expected deadlock in Congress now that the two chambers of government are split, Mr Trump could be tempted to wield his executive pen even more.Executive Orders signed per year in officeGlobal shares are mixed this morning, reflecting uncertainty over the implications of the midterm elections.While the outcome of the vote was largely expected, it does potentially complicate Mr Trump\u0027s legal troubles and policymaking agenda. It was unclear how the ided Congress might impact Trump\u0027s pursuit of an America first trade strategy that has drawn the world\u0027s two biggest economies into a trade war.European and U.S. futures are struggling to make up their mind as investors digest the implication of the midterm election, said Naeem Aslam of Thinkmarkets.One thing is for certain, the midterm election was mainly about Trump. President\u0027s policies have ided the country and this was the first major political test of his presidency, he said in a commentary.Europe seemed encouraged by the results: France\u0027s CAC 40 rose 1.3 percent to 5,141.65, while Germany\u0027s DAX added 1.2 percent to 11,620.55. Britain\u0027s FTSE 100 gained nearly 1.0 percent to 7,110.71. Futures advanced, with the contract for the Dow up 0.6 percent at 25,783.00 and S\u0026ampP 500 futures surging 0.7 percent to 2,779.50.You can follow all the latest news from the markets via our live blog. The European Union\u0027s deputy chief executive hailed Democratic victories, taking a clear swipe at what he called rudeness and racism under President Donald Trump.Frans Timmermans, a former Dutch foreign minister who is first vice president of the European Commission led by Jean-Claude Juncker, tweeted:Campaigning is getting under way in Europe for May elections to the European Parliament, in which Timmermans is leading the campaign for the centre-left.A fellow Socialist commissioner, former French finance minister Pierre Moscovici who oversees economic affairs, also tweeted an ironic comment about Trump, who had earlier declared on Twitter that the election was a tremendous success.The Democrats win the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years despite powerful Republican gerrymandering, Moscovici wrote. Donald Trump is right: \u0027Tremendous success tonight\u0027.US singers and actors have been reacting to the results from the midterms.John Legend celebrated the restoration of voting rights for some felons in Florida. Bon Iver congratulated Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat who was re-elected Senator in Wisconsin. Billy Eichner, the comedian and actor,  was delighted by the election victory of Jared Polis, who became America\u0027s first openly gay governor in Colorado. And Bette Midler gave her verdict on the re-election of Ted Cruz in Texas.White House aides have called on Democrats to work with Republicans in the next Congress.I don\u0027t know that there will be much of an appetite for Democrat lawmakers to spend all of their time, or most of their time or even a fraction of their time investigating, instigating, trying to impeach and subpoena people.Mr Trump called House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, a conversation that her office said included congratulations and a nod to her pitch for bipartisanship.In addition to his conversation with Ms Pelosi, the president called Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, as well as a number of candidates he backed during the race, the White House said.It\u0027s official - Democrats have won a House majority.Democrats picked up at least two dozen House seats on Tuesday, capturing the 218 seats needed to break Republicans\u0027 eight-year hold on the House that began with the tea party revolt of 2010.While Republicans retained control of the Senate, the Democratic win in the House ends the GOP monopoly on power in Washington and opens a new era of ided government.Democratic candidates flipped seats in a host of suburban districts outside Washington, New York, Philadelphia, Miami, Chicago and Denver, including many that were won by Hillary Clinton in 2016.Democrats also made inroads in Trump country, winning several races dominated by white working-class voters.The Nevada race has been called for Jacky Rosen, offering Democrats pickup in the Senate to offset their losses so far, writes Rob Crilly.Some factors behind the result: The day was marked by very high turnout. All the signs suggested voters were highly mobilised.At the Republican party tonight, I spoke to a number of people who said they were worried that Donald Trump\u0027s hardline immigration rhetoric would not play well in Nevada, with its high Hiic population and immigrants working in the hospitality industry.The Democrats had a very effective vote machine in the form of the Culinary Union Local 226, who deployed hundreds of workers to make sure that registered Democrats turned up and voted.All of it suggests that Democrats are on course - largely through Demographics - to turn the Sun States, such as Texas and Arizona, blue in the years to come. In another gubernatorial contest, the close fought race in Georgia, where Democrat Stacey Abrams was seeking to become the first black woman to be elected governor of a US state, remained too close to call early on Wednesday. Abrams, 44, was locked in a tight battle with Republican Brian Kemp, the state\u0027s secretary of state. There was a minor party candidate also in the race, and under Georgia law, if no candidate exceeds 50 percent of the vote, the top two finishers advance to a December runoff election.By 2 a.m. EST (0700 GMT), Kemp held a three-point lead, but Abrams told her supporters that she expected a runoff once all votes were counted.I promise you tonight that we are going to make sure every vote is counted, she said. We are still on the verge of history, and the best is yet to come.Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has been defeated by Democrat Tony Evers, denying the polarising Republican and one-time presidential candidate a third term.Evers\u0027 win on Tuesday is a huge victory for Democrats, who couldn\u0027t find the recipe to take out Walker in three previous elections, including a 2012 recall.Scott Walker, governor of Wisconsin, was defeated on TuesdayEvers campaigned on the promise of cutting middle-class income taxes, eliminating a tax credit programme for manufacturers and possibly raising the gas tax to pay for roads.Evers is a former teacher who\u0027s been state schools superintendent since 2009. He turned his understated personality to his advantage in the campaign, arguing that voters were tired of isiveness and yearned for more collegial politics.The Democrats\u0027 gains tonight have big implications for the Russia investigation, and for Silicon Valley, writes Laurence Dodds.Being in control of the House of Representatives gives Democrats the power to appoint committee heads. Previously, the House intelligence committee was chaired by Devin Nunes, a Trump loyalist who has continually battled the Mueller investigation and who has received campaign donations from executives at Oracle, one of the more Right-leaning tech companies. Now it will be Adam Schiff, a Democrat who has been much more outspoken about the Valley\u0027s role in misinformation. (Mr Schiff has also received donations from Oracle, but not from the executives who gave to Mr Nunes.) He has called on companies such as Facebook and Twitter to hire more moderators to police their services, and accused them of doing the minimum amount necessary to handle the problem. He has also warned that more needs to be done to stop foreign interference and that social media companies must go against their economic interests to be good corporate citizens. When the US Senate called Mark Zuckerberg and other tech titans to testify earlier this year, it made headlines. Perhaps now the House will seek a bigger piece of the action.Of the remaining seven Senate seats yet to be called, four are classed as toss-ups: Arizona, Florida, Montana and Nevada. Florida and Montana are projected to turn Republican, according to US networks, as the Democrat incumbents struggle to hold on in states Donald Trump won in 2016.In the House, the Democrats have won at least 208 seats with more than 30 still to be counted.An estimated 114 million votes were cast in the House election, smashing the 83 million cast in 2014 according to the New York Times. Senate results currently show that 40.7 million votes have been cast for the Democrats while the Republicans have 31.6 million. These numbers may change as more results come in through the morning.Beto O\u0027Rourke gave an emotionally charged concession speech at his election night event at a baseball stadium in El Paso, Texas, Nick Allen writes.Mr O\u0027Rourke said he had called Ted Cruz to congratulate him and quieted boos from the crowd at the mention of Mr Cruz\u0027s name. He said he had promised to help Mr Cruz in any way possible to represent Texas. To a large cheer Mr O\u0027Rourke then told his supporters: I\u0027m so f------ proud of you guys.He added: No-one thought this was possible to create a campaign for people from all walks of life. This campaign has a special place in the history of this country. I\u0027m forever change in the most profoundly positive way. I believe in you, I believe in Texas, I believe in this country.I\u0027m as inspired, I am as hopeful as I have ever been in my life. This country is in no way diminished at this moment. I know we will continue to work to come together. To chants of Beto, Beto he left open the possibility of a future electoral campaign. I love you more than words can express, he said. We\u0027ll see you out there down the road. Mr O\u0027Rourke left the stage to John Lennon\u0027s Imagine. Some of his supporters left the baseball stadium in tears.In a night of political firsts, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar have become the first two Muslim women to be elected to the US Congress. Ms Tlaib called Donald Trump\u0027s election a bat signal for women when I interviewed her last month, you can read the full piece here.Kristi Noem has become South Dakota\u0026#39s first female governorElsewhere, Democrat Janet Mills was elected Maine\u0027s first female governor, defeating Republican Shawn Moody and putting seat back in Democratic hands. South Dakota also voted in its first female state governor with Republican Kristi Noem defeating Democrat Billie Sutton. New Mexico Democrat Deb Haaland and Kansas Democrat Sharice Davids were elected the first two Native American women to serve in Congress.Women will break the current record of 84 serving at the same time in the House of Representatives.With ballots still being counted across the country, women have won 75 seats and are assured of victory in nine districts where women are the only major-party candidates.The majority of gains are among the Democrats. From the Women\u0027s March opposing President Donald Trump the day after his inauguration in January 2017, through a stream of sexual assault accusations later that year that sparked the #MeToo movement, outrage and organising by women have defined Democratic Party politics this election cycle.More than 230 women, many of them first-time candidates, were on the general-election ballots in House races.Despite the gains, men will continue to hold the vast majority of House seats.I’m at an election night party in a cinema in Oakland, California, a liberal neighbour city of San Francisco where the Black Panthers once had their stronghold.It would be hard to find a pro-Trump party in this city, but California in general is not just a lock for the Democrats. Republicans are defending the 10th House district, east of San Jose, and the 25th, where the Republican incumbent had distanced himself from his party’s hard line on immigration. Other blue targets include Orange County outside Los Angeles, which has become competitive due to the arrival of more Asian and Latino Americans, and the 50th district outside San Diego, where Republican Duncan Hunter was made vulnerable by allegations of misusing campaign funds.In the cinema, there were huge cheers and whoops for Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who look very likely to become the first Muslim women in Congress. Ms Omar came to America decades ago as a refugee from Somalia, while Tlaib is the daughter of Palestinian immigrants.There were also loud boos for the narrow victory of Ron DeSantis over Andrew Gillum in the race to be governor of Florida – and for Diane Feinstein, the Democrat who many Leftists feel is not too centrist (My girlfriend observes: “It’s like a pantomime!”).“We’ve been so much on the defensive, so hopefully this puts us in a position if being more offensive, more strategic,” said Democrat supporter Emma Ishii.It could be some time yet before we know the outcome of the Senate race here in Nevada, Rob Crilly writes. This was supposed to be the big seat for Democrats - a state they won in 2016 giving them the best chance of unseating a Republican incumbent. But we already know that Republicans will hold the Senate, whatever the result here.Voting was supposed to finish almost two hours ago. But there were long lines at polling centres, delaying the close of voting.Dean Heller, the Republican senator, just addressed his supporters here in Las Vegas, thanking the president for making multiple visits to Nevada.“Our message is good,” he said. “Our message here in America is good. Look at what this economy is doing thanks to this president and this Republican Congress that put American and Nevada back to work.”Republican Josh Hawley wins Missouri Senate race, ousting Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill. Another heavy loss for the Democratic party in the Senate.It was as much relief as celebration, Rob Crilly writes. After days of quietly fearing the worst, Republicans in Nevada are beginning to think this could be a good night.  The quiet hum at their party in the South Point Hotel and Casino in Law Vegas gave way to whoops and cheers as Fox News called the Texas Senate race for Ted Cruz, which effectively means the party retains control of the Senate.Depending on how our local races go, this could be a good night, said Joe Ludwig, who works in medical customer services. Just breaking even feels good at this stage. There\u0027s no wave and a few extra seats in the Senate could help the president, even if he loses the House.Nancy Pelosi, the most senior Democrat in the House, is speaking at the party\u0027s headquarters in Washington. We\u0027ve all had enough of ision, she says to loud cheers. Mrs Pelosi went on to promise accountability, saying Democrats will strive for bipartisanship.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi arrives to celebrate Democratic House wins“Thanks to you we owned the ground,” she says. “Thanks to you tomorrow will be a new day in America. Remember this feeling. Note the power to win.”Donald Trump has praised the tremendous success for his Republican party in tonight\u0027s results. However the White House has called a lid for pool reporters, meaning the president will not speak tonight. Andrew Gillum has conceded defeat in Florida\u0027s governor race against Republican Ron DeSantis, in what was one of the most vicious campaigns of the year.  Mr Gillum, the former Tallahassee mayor, had been hoping to become the state\u0027s first African American governor. The bitter campaign had included accusations of dog whistle politics, but Donald Trump made several trips to the state to stump for Mr DeSantis.This is an important result for Mr Trump, Florida is America\u0027s most populous swing state and governors have huge sway over mobilising party activists and raising donations for the 2020 presidential race.The Texas senate result was called while a band was on stage at Beto O\u0027Rourke\u0027s election night party, Nick Allen reports. The crowd was listening to an accordionist as news spread by way of social media on phones. When the band finished a silence fell. There were some, rather half-hearted chants of Beto, Beto.It was a shock for a lot of the first-time voters who had packed into a baseball stadium in El Paso firmly believing their candidate was about to pull off an historic upset. Not long before the race was called Ted Cruz\u0027s campaign had indicated they thought they were in for a long night. When the result came his supporters at an event in Houston burst into chants of We want Ted! We want Ted!Democrat Heidi Heitkamp has lost her senate seat in North Dakota, losing to Republican Kevin Cramer. This was a crucial target for Republicans in a state that voted for Donald Trump in 2016. Ms Heitkamp became one of the most endangered Democrats in the Senate after she voted against Brett Kavanaugh\u0027s Supreme Court nomination.Many of tonight\u0027s results were predictable. The Democrats have done well in the House, which was inevitable given Trump’s low approval rating, two years of controversy and the continued shift of suburban voters to the Democratic column. But the Republicans have also done well in the Senate – in part thanks to Democrats defending incumbencies in states that favoured Trump (Indiana, North Dakota etc). In other words, the Republicans have had luck and math on their side.One notable exception is here in Pennsylvania where it looks like the Republicans have been cut down from 15 out of 18 House seats to a paltry 6. This was due in part to a court-ordered redistricting.Both sides will have to confront substantial challenges. Would the Democrats have done even better if they had moved to the centre? It has been suggested that Beto O’Rourke could have won Texas if he had courted Ted Cruz’s voters, but he didn’t. He went pro-immigration, pro-impeachment, pro-gun control. As for the Republicans, what do they do about Trump? He has identified and energised a populist coalition that snagged him the presidency – but he has also placed limits on where the Republicans can win state-by-state. The exit polls suggest large parts of the country resent his rhetoric on immigration and feel the country is headed in the wrong direction. Given that the economy is so strong, they presumably mean it is becoming too isive and violent.We’ll see where things stand in the morning. I’m going to try to sleep but there’s a party in the tavern downstairs. I’m using CNN as white noise to drown it out.I\u0027ve arrived at the Republican election night party in Las Vegas. It\u0027s the same place they saw in the 2016 election result - I wonder if they are superstitious. There\u0027s a degree of realism in the air. Most expect to lose the House tonight. But limiting Democrats to a majority of 15 or fewer, and holding the Senate would go down as a good result.Rising left-wing rock star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made history on Tuesday as the youngest woman elected to Congress, in a safe Democratic Party stronghold in New York.The 29-year-old has championed her working class and Puerto Rican roots, moonlighting as a bartender until defeating a Democratic grandee in a party primary earlier this year, capturing imaginations around the country.On Tuesday, she trounced Republican opponent Anthony Pappas in her constituency, a Democratic stronghold in a erse part of Queens and the Bronx.The \u0027s US Editor, Ben Riley-Smith, spent a day out on the campaign trail with her earlier this year. Read his profile of the young Congresswoman here.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to CongressMs Ocasio-Cortez\u0027s win beats the previous record held by Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a former White House aide to president George W Bush who was first elected to an upstate New York constituency in 2014 aged 30.Before that, the last record was last set by former Democratic representative Elizabeth Holtzman in Brooklyn, who won a seat in the House in 1972 when she was 31 years old and took her seat in 1973.Women occupy just 23 percent of the seats in the current US Senate and 19.3 percent in the House of Representatives, comparatively low rates in the developed world.Republican Ted Cruz has held onto his senate seat in Texas, defeating Democratic challenger Beto O\u0027Rourke. Democrat Jared Polis has been elected Colorado\u0027s governor, defeating Republican Walker Stapleton. Mr Polis is the country\u0027s first openly gay male governor.Having picked up two new Senate seats, NBC is predicting the Republican will maintain their control of the chamber. Meanwhile Democrat Heidi Heitkamp is projected to lose her senate seat in North Dakota. If this is true, it extremely unlikely the Democrats can take the Senate.Republican Mitt Romney has won a senate seat in Utah after returning to front line politics, defeating Democrat Jenny Wilson. Mr Romney has been something of a thorn in Donald Trump\u0027s side, frequently criticising the president in public.Mitt Romney has regularly criticised the presidentHe ran against Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election and took a back seat from national politics for a while after his defeat.Speaking outside the White House, press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared to be conceding Republicans may have lost control of the House. Asked about that possibility of a Democratic takeover, she said: The president\u0027s agenda isn\u0027t going to change regardless of whose party is there.Three Democratic senators have held onto their seats.Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin has won a second term, defeating Republican Leah Vukmir Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has won a third term, defeating Republican Jim Newberger and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico has also won re-election, defeating Republican Mick Rich. Nick Allen has an update from Texas:With 58 per cent of the vote in Ted Cruz and O’Rourke both have more than 2 million votes - and O’Rourke is ahead...by just 79. This could be an absolute nailbiter.The suburbs of Houston are still to come in and could be good for the Democrat. But Cruz has been campaigning a lot there, and he lives in Houston. He’s also got a lot of reliably red rural areas to come in.O’Rourke has hired out a baseball stadium in El Paso for his election party. Supporters, many of them very young, are pouring in to the stands and a DJ is playing on a stage erected on the outfield. It’s an untraditional election night event.The USA appears – touch wood – to have made it through the midterms without a major cyberattack targeting election infrastructure, Laurence Dodds writes.Matthew Prince, chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Cloudflare, said his company hadn\u0027t seen any such incidents. Perhaps it helped that the Pentagon had given US government hackers authority to retaliate against any nation which attempted one.But the vote has not been free of foreign information operations – that is, political campaigns run using deceptive methods such as bots, fake accounts and false identities. Although most such activity now comes from Americans, Facebook said this morning that it had blocked around 30 accounts after a tip-off from authorities involving foreign entities. Separately, an app created by the comedian Samantha Bee which allows users to report attempts at voter suppression has received 800 such reports, including claims of vigilantes hanging around the polls trying to intimidate people.Fox News has projected a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. Whether this projection, so early in the night, will hold true remains to be seen.Democratic incumbent Joe Donnelly has lost his senate seat in Indiana, the home state of Vice President Mike Pence. The winner, Republican Mike Braun, has picked up another crucial seat for his party. This was a key target for the Republicans and Mr Trump campaigned in the state multiple times, returning again on his final day of rallies on Monday.Early results are showing the Republicans holding on to some House seats Democrats had hoped to flip, suggesting the predicted \u0027blue wave\u0027 is failing to materialise.Republican businessman Bill Lee is elected Tennessee governor, defeating Democratic former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean. But in Illinois, Democrat JB Pritzker has managed to unseat the incumbent Republican governor Bruce Rauner. In more predictable results, Republican Greg Abbott of Texas, Democrat Andrew Cuomo of New York, Democrat Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania re-elected and Republican Larry Hogan of Maryland were all re-elected as state governors. Republican Mark Gordon will by Wyoming\u0027s next governor. Republican John Barrasso of Wyoming has been  re-elected to the Senate. Democrat Bob Casey of Pennsylvania has won a third Senate term, beating Republican challenger Lou Barletta.  Republican Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi has also won re-election, defeating Democrat David Baria.Democratic Senator Joe Manchin has been re-elected in West Virginia, defeating Republican challenger Patrick Morrisey. This was the most pro-Trump state of the 2016 election, and a key target for Republicans this year. This is a personal loss for Mr Trump, who campaigned in the state multiple times in the run up to Tuesday\u0027s election. Democrat senator Kirsten Gillibrand has been re-elected in New York. Ms Gillibrand has been touted as a future presidential candidate.Democratic Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey has been re-elected to third term, defeating Republican Bob Hugin. It was a surprisingly close race given the state is traditionally blue. Mr Hugin had distanced himself from the president, calling his plan to end birthright citizenship wrong. Greg Pence, the brother of Vice President Mike Pence, has been elected to Congress in Indiana. He was running in the Vice President\u0027s former seat in Indiana\u0027s 6th district, a staunchly Republican area.Polls have closed on America\u0027s east coast, with a number of battleground House and Senate races remaining competitive. What are the results so far?Democrat Sherrod Brown has been re-elected to the Senate in Ohio, defeating Republican Jim Renacci. In his victory speech, Mr Brown said his win should be “the blueprint for our nation in 2020” - prompting speculation about the 2020 presidential election.Republican Charlie Baker has been elected to serve a second term as Massachusetts governor. He defeated Democrat Jay Gonzalez, who was hoping to become the state\u0027s first Hiic governor. Elsewhere Republican Asa Hutchinson has won a second term as Arkansas governor, defeating Democrat Jared Henderson. In Rhode Island, Democratic Governor Gina Raimondo has won a second term, defeating Republican Allan Fung. Mr Fung was hoping to become the state\u0027s first Asian governor.This analysis from Joshua Wilson on our data team:According to the latest exit poll from CNN, the top issue on voters minds as they headed to the ballot box on Tuesday was health care, with 41 per cent of voters listing it as their top issue.Health care is the top issue for voters in this years mid termsIn previous years the economy has been the top issue which has played to the strengths of the Republicans, but health care favours the Democrats much more strongly and they have campaigned heavily on this topic. Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Chris Murphy of  Connecticut, Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, Tom Carper of Delaware, and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island have all been re-elected for another six-year term, according to the Associated Press.Democrats have seized a House seat in Virginia with Jennifer Wexton predictably defeating incumbent Republican Barbara Comstock. Virginia 10  is a district which Hillary Clinton won in 2016. This is a key signal of how the Democrats are going to fare in the suburbs. Our own Nick Allen visited Virginia 10 last week to see how Donald Trump\u0027s Republican party was going down with suburban, female, college-educated voters. Read his dispatch here.Elsewhere in Virginia, Tim Kaine, Mrs Clinton\u0027s running mate in 2016, has been re-elected to the Senate. Mr Kaine comfortably beat Republican Corey Stewart. Bernie Sanders, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, has been re-elected as a senator in Vermont. Mr Sanders ran as an independent candidate with the Democratic party\u0027s backing, as he has done in previous years.Bernie Sanders has been re-elected for another six-year term in the US SenatePresident Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are watching the results at the White House with friends and family.This in from Sarah Sanders, the White House Press Secretary:  “As President, Donald J Trump has headlined an unprecedented 50 rallies — 30 in the last two months alone — and he has campaigned for dozens of candidates at all levels of government. The President has energised a staggering number of Americans at packed arenas and in overflow crowds at rallies across the country.Under President Trump’s leadership, the Republican National Committee has raised more than a quarter billion dollars, fueling an extraordinary ground game geared toward defying midterm history and protecting the GOP’s majorities.He has made the choice clear to the American people: Tonight, we can continue down the path of American prosperity and security or we can go backwards. The President and First Lady look forward to watching the results come in with friends and family in the White House residence.” Please review our commenting policyCommuters spending more than an hour to travel to work up by a third in less than a decadeElectric scooters could be allowed on Britain’s roads for first time as government plans to change lawDark Heart, episode 3, review: this gory crime drama has taken on a Brexity vibeGrand Designs: House of the Year, review: homes to drool over (or sneer at)Asia Bibi freed from jail after eight years on death row for blasphemyQueen Victoria\u0026#39s tiny mourning dress goes on display for first time Comment: Success at a priceComment: Boys can\u0026#39t be left to raise themselves - we need to give them the protection, hierarchy and structure gangs offerSelf-driving cars could function as moving brothels, academics predictSuicides spike on Monday mornings, according to new study in Japan\u0026#39Split decision\u0026#39: How US newspapers reacted to the midterm electionsComment: The five new rules turning Western politics on its headDutch man, 69, who \u0026#39identifies as 20 years younger\u0026#39 launches legal battle to change ageTrusts allowing families to pay less inheritance tax could be reformed by HMRC Fewer than 1 in 100 theft offences are being solved by police, analysis shows as police criticised over prioritiesComment: In Trump\u0026#39s America, culture beats the economy at the pollsTheresa May shows Cabinet proposed Brexit withdrawal agreement but ministers demand to see legal advice behind itGrand Designs houses: what happened next? Scottish Parliament backs second EU referendum in vote exposing SNP and Labour isionsEU migrants aged between 18 and 30 will be able to come to Britain under post-Brexit visa schemeLibya shelves plans for December elections as fighting between rival militias intensifiesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/27/12/jet-capsule.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3906706  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/27/12/jet-capsule.jpg","title":"apple macbook air review best laptops 2018 specs price display battery","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsThe latest Apple laptop is gorgeous and capable\u0026nbsp– and a fitting update to a successful favouriteClick to followThe Independent TechThe MacBook Air\u0026nbspchanged how people saw lightweight laptops when it was first announced 10 years ago, revealed when then Apple CEO Steve Jobs slid it out of a manila envelope.It was very expensive then, but over the years, the original design became the entry-level Apple laptop.

That super-slim profile which sloped down to an impossibly thin edge? That\u0027s what this laptop looks like when the lid is closed. It\u0027s a little smaller in most directions. It used to be 32.5cm wide, now it\u0027s 30.41cm. Before, it was 22.7cm deep, but this has shrunk to 21.24cm and its height (its thickness when closed, in other words) has gone from 1.7cm to 1.56cm at its thickest. Note, though, that the thinnest measurement of all, that uncannily thin lip, has actually crept up from 0.3cm to 0.41cm now. In other words, it\u0027s smaller in every direction except at the very edge where it\u0027s all of 1.1mm thicker. Big deal. Oh, and it\u0027s dropped from 1.35kg to 1.25kg in weight.This means it\u0027s the lightest Apple laptop apart from the MacBook (0.92kg).The point is that compared to the previous MacBook Air it\u0027s improved, apart from a tiny bit extra on the thinnest measurement, which I defy anyone to notice. That\u0027s before we get to the colour, which was silver only until now. The new model also comes in space grey, as well as a fruity, peachy gold shade to the aluminium that continues to make up the laptop\u0027s structure.The Apple logo is no longer backlit, instead it\u0027s a reflective metallic apple, carefully colour-matched to the aluminium frame around it. This\u0026nbspbrings the MacBook Air into line with the design language of the other latest MacBook and MacBook Pro models.It looks tremendous, a perfect balance between small body size and big screen, thanks to the tiny bezel that runs round the display. This bezel is nothing compared to the wide silver frame around the display which was required when the first model arrived.The connectivity has been updated, too. There\u0027s no SD card slot, no USB-A ports and no wonderful MagSafe power connector. Only the headphone socket is carried over to the new laptop. What\u0027s new is the same Thunderbolt 3 USB-C connector found on the MacBook, used for data transfer and charging. Except this laptop has two of them, which is a very big improvement. It\u0027s not the super-useful four sockets that are found on the MacBook Pro, but it\u0027s a very welcome upgrade.The other visual difference is the trackpad, which is noticeably larger on this new laptop. And it\u0027s a Force Touch pad, that is, it gives the impression of moving when it\u0027s only a persuasive haptic feedback that\u0027s fooling your finger. This is one of the most noticeable changes to the laptop, once you\u0027ve stopped admiring the thin dark bezel and all-glass covering that succeeded the silver aluminium frame.The 13.3-inch screen is now –\u0026nbspfinally! –\u0026nbspa Retina display. Instead of the 128 pixels per inch (ppi) on previous similarly-sized MacBook Air screens, this has leapt to 227 ppi. To say this makes a difference is an understatement. Actually, it\u0027s more that if you used the MacBook Air, it was fine until you glanced at a recent MacBook or MacBook Pro with their glorious Retina displays, and then you simply didn\u0027t want to go back. Now, the MacBook Air has joined the Retina club.It\u0027s unquestionably the upgrade Air users waiting to replace their laptop have been aching for over the last few years. There are more colours available on this screen\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp48 per cent more, Apple says –\u0026nbspand in this respect also, the improved display is a big step forward.Since the display has been upgraded, you may very well want to watch video on it –\u0026nbspafter all, it\u0027s bigger than the largest iPad screen, and almost as high-resolution. So, you\u0027ll be glad of the improved audio. Apple says the new stereo speakers offer twice the bass and an extra 25 per cent of volume compared to the last model. I haven\u0027t measured it, you understand, but it absolutely sounds better and definitely loud. There are three microphones on board, which is useful because this laptop supports hands-free Siri, of which more later.It may look just like the old keyboard but wait until you try it. To be fair, the original MacBook Air keyboard was a sumptuously comfortable user experience which some feel has never been bettered. The new keyboard was clickier and noisier. This is the third-generation of the new butterfly-mechanism keyboard which is noticeably quieter than the second-gen. And, unlike the previous MacBook Air, this one is now in line with the other Apple laptops, with inidually backlit keys. Of course, you\u0027d expect the processor to be cutting-edge. It is, and although in everyday use the previous MacBook Air was perfectly fast enough, this is noticeably more capable and speedier, even down to simple things like opening files and launching apps. When I first saw the second-generation MacBook Air, all those years ago, I was told that battery life was excellent and plugging it in all day long just wasn\u0027t necessary. That\u0027s just as true today and in the week or so that I\u0027ve been testing the laptop, it\u0027s lasted more or less a full day with ease. Important in a laptop as portable as this one. The processor is powerful enough to let you talk to your computer. Say Hey, Siri from across the room and it\u0027ll respond. Only the most recent MacBook Pro models can match this. Although it lacks the super-cool Touch Bar of high-end MacBook Pro models, the MacBook Air has stolen another excellent feature: Touch ID. Nestled to the right of the function keys is a tiny, glossy square. Register your fingerprint and you can unlock it with one touch. This is a brilliantly intimate way to open your Mac, quicker and simpler than a password and only beaten for ease by unlocking with the Apple Watch. You can use Touch ID for Apple Pay, too, when you\u0027re paying for stuff online. It\u0027s made of aluminium. Well, that\u0027s normally not much of a thing to focus on. But this MacBook Air is the first Apple device to be made from 100 per cent recycled aluminium. The bits left over when other MacBooks, iPhones and iPad are created have been turned into this new laptop thanks to Apple metallurgists working on how to create a new alloy that can be re-used effectively. Note that the colour of the laptop is identical to the colours used in non-recycled Macs –\u0026nbspa sign of the success of this alloy. It means the carbon footprint is half that of the last MacBook. Apple uses smelting processes which are less harmful than some manufacturers in the first place, but now, with this laptop, no smelting has been necessary at all, which is a definite bonus for the environment.Which MacBook should you buy?That\u0027s an interesting question. The new MacBook Air sells for £1,199, that\u0027s £50 cheaper than the cheapest MacBook, which has a smaller display, older processor and lacks some of the best features of the new Air such as an extra USB-C socket, Touch ID and hands-free Siri. On the face of it, it\u0027s a no-brainer: why spend more for a less advanced machine?The only reason is portability –\u0026nbspthe MacBook is small and significantly lighter than the Air. You really feel the difference when you\u0027re holding both, though neither is exactly heavyweight. If you\u0027re happy with the weight of the Air (and pick it up in store to see for yourself) then the Air wins out in every other department, from its glorious screen to its extra speed and features. And if you want the cheapest MacBook of all, the Air with its previous design, is still available, for £949. This older model is likely to remain a keen choice for the budget-conscious for some time to come. Mind you, the new one is way better in every single respect (unless you really need an SD memory card slot, and –\u0026nbspyou know what? – there are dongles for that).Unless you need something super-light, the MacBook Air is the best choice. Unless you need advanced processing power that only the MacBook Pro can deliver, the MacBook Air is the best choice. The new model is pricier than the old, but it offers a great balance between power and portability. The new design is cute, especially the new gold finish, and the addition of Touch ID is a genuine advantage. Most of all, it\u0027s a reminder that in the last 10 years, not much has happened to overtake the design ethos of the MacBook Air, apart from a better screen, faster processor, slimmer bezel, better connectivity and improved security in the form of Touch ID. All of which are included here.The new MacBook Air was a hugely popular laptop. Goodness knows we\u0027ve been waiting a long time for this upgrade, but it\u0027s here, and Apple has delivered the goods.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mr Fairburn is leaving “by mutual agreement and at the request of the company”, according to a statement to the London Stock Exchange, and will depart his role at the end of the year. The building boss was awarded the\u0026nbspbonus as part of a long-term incentive plan, which effectively hands over 9 per cent of Persimmon’s shares – worth hundreds of millions of pounds – to senior managers over a decade.Persimmon chief’s meltdown shows the value of good PR advicePersimmon boss Jeff Fairburn heats up £75m bonus scandalPersimmon boss shuts down interview, refusing to discuss £75m bonusPersimmon: Will £100m CEO Jeff Fairburn accept blame if roof falls in?He was originally granted a £100m bonus, but after a public backlash agreed to reduce that sum by 25 per cent. However, Mr Fairburn recently walked out of an interview after being questioned about the payout, leading to further publicity about the bonus, by far the largest paid to the boss of a public company in the UK last year. Persimmon said on Wednesday that the board “believes that the distraction around his remuneration ... continues to have a negative impact on the reputation of the business and consequently on Jeff’s ability to continue in his role”. Mr Fairburn said: “It has been an honour to lead Persimmon through an exciting period of development.\u0026nbspI had hoped that revealing my plans to create a charitable trust and to waive a proportion of the award would enable the company to put the issue of the 2012 LTIP behind it. “However, this has not been the case and so it is clearly now in the best interests of Persimmon that I should step down. I wish the company the very best for the future.”David Jenkinson, currently group managing director, will be appointed as interim chief executive on 31 December, and the board has begun a formal recruitment process to hire a permanent replacement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The retail giant plans to announced the new chairman in the second half of next year. Sir Charlie is the fifth chairman of JLP, and has held the role since 2007. He said: “Although my departure is still a considerable way off, the appointment of my successor is a key responsibility. John Lewis is killing off the DVD playerIt is for this reason I have decided to lay out the timetable now to enable an open and thorough process to select the next chairman of the partnership.”John Lewis has not been immune from the general gloom that has pervaded the British high street in 2018. Earlier this year, the group revealed that profits had been all but wiped out, and announced a number of store closures. At the time, Sir Charlie said: “These are challenging times in retail. We’re continuing to improve our offer for customers while ensuring we have the financial strength to continue developing our business going forward.”The company has been struggling as rival retailers have applied heavy discounts in a bid to withstand the downward trend in consumer spending. This puts John Lewis under pressure because of its ‘Never Knowingly Undersold’ policy, which meant the company has seen an unprecedented level of price-matching this year.

In recent months, its price has been relatively stable and is currently trading at around $0.26 (£0.20), however Stellar\u0027s current transaction volume is less than 2 per cent of bitcoin\u0027s.Speaking at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon on Tuesday, 6 November, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith explained his vision for spreading awareness and usage of cryptocurrency.We\u0027re doing this because we want you to truly\u0026nbspunderstand crypto, he told the audience.\u0026nbspAnd the only way to truly understand it is to use it.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Persimmon said on Wednesday that the board “believes that the distraction around his remuneration ... continues to have a negative impact on the reputation of the business and consequently on Jeff’s ability to continue in his role”. Mr Fairburn said: “It has been an honour to lead Persimmon through an exciting period of development.\u0026nbspI had hoped that revealing my plans to create a charitable trust and to waive a proportion of the award would enable the company to put the issue of the 2012 LTIP behind it. “However, this has not been the case and so it is clearly now in the best interests of Persimmon that I should step down. I wish the company the very best for the future.”David Jenkinson, currently group managing director, will be appointed as interim chief executive on 31 December, and the board has begun a formal recruitment process to hire a permanent replacement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The retail giant plans to announced the new chairman in the second half of next year. Sir Charlie is the fifth chairman of JLP, and has held the role since 2007. He said: “Although my departure is still a considerable way off, the appointment of my successor is a key responsibility. John Lewis is killing off the DVD playerIt is for this reason I have decided to lay out the timetable now to enable an open and thorough process to select the next chairman of the partnership.”John Lewis has not been immune from the general gloom that has pervaded the British high street in 2018. Earlier this year, the group revealed that profits had been all but wiped out, and announced a number of store closures. At the time, Sir Charlie said: “These are challenging times in retail. We’re continuing to improve our offer for customers while ensuring we have the financial strength to continue developing our business going forward.”The company has been struggling as rival retailers have applied heavy discounts in a bid to withstand the downward trend in consumer spending. This puts John Lewis under pressure because of its ‘Never Knowingly Undersold’ policy, which meant the company has seen an unprecedented level of price-matching this year.

If so, that might have happened by accident – or the object might in fact be a spacecraft made by an alien race, they said.Alien asteroids could have brought life to Earth from spaceThe object might be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilisation, the researchers write.It is not the first time that astronomers have suggested the rock could potentially be an alien spacecraft. Soon after it was discovered, researchers with the Breakthrough Listen project announced they would be monitoring it and seeing if it was sending out radio signals.The new study, written by\u0026nbspShmuel Bialy and Abraham Loeb from the Harvard Smithsonian Centre\u0026nbspfor Astrophysics, looks at the way that solar radiation could be used to power the object as it flies through space. They calculate that it would have to be very thin but very wide – and that such a shape would be possible.If they are right that the object is being propelled by radiation pressure from the sun, then it will be a breakthrough even if it is entirely natural. Such an object would be of a kind never before seen, most likely formed by an entirely unknown process happening deep in space.But it might in fact be artificial in origin, they write. One\u0026nbsppossibility is that ‘Oumuamua\u0026nbspis a\u0026nbsplightsail, floating in interstellar space as a debris from an advanced technological equipment, the authors claim, and it might be unused debris that has\u0026nbspbeen thrown out into space from a planetary system.Such an explanation would account for the various strange characteristics of Oumuamua, including the unusual shape it seems to have.Scientists on Earth have already looked to develop that kind of technology, which would be used to make tiny spacecraft that could be shot through space at intense speed and be pushed only by light. It might already have been developed elsewhere, they write, and could be used for transporting cargo between planets or even between stars.But even more strange is a theory that the rock could have been sent here on purpose. Alternatively, a more exotic scenario is that ‘Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization, they write.Oumuamua is now too far away from Earth for scientists to understand any more about it. But more could be found by looking into the solar system for more objects of this type, the authors say – which could happen more in coming years, as new ways of surveying the sky are turned on.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It didn\u0027t say when it would show off what the phone actually looks like or any other features.Samsung \u0027Galaxy X\u0027 foldable phone tablet to be unveiled this weekBut demonstrations on stage appeared to show the phone\u0027s screen working, shrinking when it was bent over on itself into the phone setup.And it said new screen technologies would allow it to run three apps at once.Samsung\u0027s announcement had already been somewhat spoiled by Google\u0027s announcement earlier in the day that it would be introducing support for folding devices into its Android operating system, and that it was working with Samsung to integrate them into its new phone.\u0026nbspAnd Samsung itself had suggested that it would have an announcement to make about the long-rumoured handset, a couple of days before the presentation.With the world\u0027s eyes on the announcement, the company spent a considerably amount of time talking about Bixby, its attempt at a voice assistant which has failed to reach the popularity of competitors like Alexa. But it then turned to the foldable phone, dimming the lights and giving a short demonstration of how it might work.Samsung has been teasing the development of the foldable phone for more than five years. It is far from the only company to be doing so, and its announcement looked to be overshadowed somewhat when another smaller firm called Royole announced that it would be releasing a foldable handset of its own.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She resigned days later, admitting she had “inadvertently misled”\u0026nbspMPs.Home Office in ‘state of disaster management’ amid surge in U-turnsHow journalists can end up dictating Home Office policyMan blocked from seeing baby after Home Office loses passportA second contradiction came when the Home Office announced that more than 60 people may had been wrongfully deported or removed from the UK – countering previous claims that there was “no evidence” any iniduals had been deported.The embarrassment deepened further when the department revealed more than 160\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspcitizens could have been wrongfully detained or deported from the UK.Another humiliating U-turn came last month, when the department admitted that people have been wrongly denied UK status after refusing to provide DNA evidence, despite previously claiming the practice existed on an “entirely voluntary basis”.Sajid\u0026nbspJavid\u0026nbspsaid the government had illegally demanded DNA evidence in family visa cases, with at least seven people denied the right to stay in Britain because they refused to provide samples to prove family ties.And\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsphas now revealed that more than 60 nationalities have contacted the Home Office with concerns over how they have been affected.This steady stream of ministerial errors has been punctuated by numerous dramatic U-turns on inidual immigration cases, prompted only once the stories are reported in the media.Prominent cases have included that of a US resident who was blocked from coming to the UK to see her seriously ill daughter because the Home Office was “not satisfied” her intentions were genuine. Within 12 hours of publication, the department reversed the decision and granted her a visa.The decision to prevent six-year-old, UK-born Mohamed\u0026nbspBangoura\u0026nbspfrom returning home to his mother following a holiday was also reversed, as was the case of\u0026nbspHafizzulah\u0026nbspHusseinkhel, a 27-year-old Afghan man who was threatened with deportation despite having served in the British army.These slip ups are occurring at a growing rate, with each having wide-ranging implications for the iniduals caught up in the hostile environment machine. But there is little doubt that the issues have been bubbling under the surface for some years now.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UK Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But it won’t include the backstop.”The inidual\u0026nbspsaid a date\u0026nbspis yet to be confirmed for the showdown cabinet meeting at which Ms May will seek broad agreement on all aspects of the withdrawal deal, but added that ministers were primed for something to take place next week.Significant differences still exist over how the UK should approach the issue of the Irish border, with ministers including Michael Gove said to have demanded to see legal advice given to the government on how to deal with the issue.At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday attorney general Geoffrey Cox made the case for backing the prime minister’s strategy and argued that the favoured approach by Brexiteers was legally difficult.But pressure\u0026nbspfor the full legal advice to be released has mounted with the Ms\u0026nbspMay’s DUP partners in government also indicating they would like it released.The Northern Irish party, whose 10 MPs prop up the prime minister’s administration in the Commons, said it was “in the public interest” for the legal advice to be disclosed.For Labour, shadow\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspsecretary Sir Keir Starmer said it was “essential” that MPs should be able to see the advice drawn up by Mr Cox.The prime minister told MPs last month that 95 per cent\u0026nbspof the deal had been agreed, although the key sticking point of the backstop to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland remained unresolved.A Downing Street source said: “That is just where we are so far. It does not imply that a deal has been done.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

There is simply no excuse – either for Labour as a whole, or for inidual Labour MPs – not to oppose this agenda and give the people a final say.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

The consequences of no deal would be catastrophic for jobs, the economy and for the border in Northern Ireland,” he said while visiting EU officials in the Belgian capital.New Channel lorry parks will not be ready in time for no-deal Brexit“I honestly don’t believe any prime minister would seriously consider taking the decision to crash the UK out of the EU without an agreement. The no-deal rhetoric from the government is a bluff and we shouldn’t fall for it.”Under the Withdrawal Act the prime\u0026nbspminister will have to face a vote in parliament about what to do if her deal is rejected Labour sources indicated that they are confident there would be no majority in the Commons for a no deal.\u0026nbspThey added that there would simply not be enough parliamentary time to pass any of the preparatory legislation that would have to be put in place by the government to prepare for such an outcome.\u0026nbspPrevious investigations by The Independent have also found that physical building work at ports and airports that would be required to deal with new customs procedures is also certain not to be ready in time.Taking pets on holiday ‘will cost £60’ after no-deal BrexitBrexit: EU steps up no-deal planning as clock counts down on talksUK and Norway agree deal to protect citizens’ rights in no-deal BrexitHome Office ‘not being straight’ with MPs over Brexit border securityAusterity to continue if Britain leaves EU with no deal, Hammond warnsMs May has repeatedly claimed that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and said she is prepared to take Britain out without an agreement. The government has said there will be no extension of revocation of Article 50 and no second referendum and that the UK will be leaving no matter what on 29 March 2019.The prime\u0026nbspminister lacks a majority in parliament and is likely to need some Labour backbenchers to vote for her agreement to get it through. Some Labour MPs have already broken cover and told The Independent that they expect to vote with the government in order to avoid a no deal, which they believe the prime minister would go through with. \u0026nbspBut Labour’s leadership has said it will vote down any deal that does not meet its six tests of preserving jobs, workers’ rights, and environmental standards, and that does not include a customs union with the EU. The party also says it will vote down a “blind Brexit” that does not give sufficient detail about the future relationship.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The event, which comes on the eve of a weekend of commemorations marking the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War, follows up on discussions at July\u0027s summit of the defence alliance. But some other EU leaders are likely to be there and it is possible Mrs May could have Brexit-related chats with them on the sidelines of the event.On Wednesday Mrs May spoke to Donald Tusk, who chairs EU leaders\u0027 summits and will play a crucial role in calling a gathering if enough progress is deemed to have been made in Brussels\u0027 talks with Britain.Theresa May talks with the president of the European Council Donald Tusk (Image: Thierry MonasseGetty Images)There are claims Mrs May needs agreement with her Cabinet by Monday to trigger a deal-making summit this month and ministers are on standby for a snap summons to Downing Street.Ministers were invited into the Cabinet Office in Whitehall to view a near-complete draft of the proposed EU withdrawal agreement.The document, which they saw in strict secrecy and were not allowed to take copies of, is believed to contain the 95 percent of the exit deal Mrs May says has been agreed with Brussels.But it is not believed to have included the proposed Irish border solution.Leaving the building, Environment Secretary Michael Gove told reporters it was a great document but did not elaborate.Increasingly influential Attorney General Geoffrey Cox was tasked at Tuesday\u0027s Cabinet meeting with drawing up a scheme to ensure that any customs union deal the UK enters into with Brussels, to avoid a hard Irish border, will be one that Britain can get out of.Mr Gove is among Brexiteers demanding that ministers see the full legal advice before approving such a deal.The Democratic Unionist Party went further saying Mrs May should break with Government convention and make the legal advice public.IRELAND DIVIDED: Varadkar UNDER FIRE for Brexit \u0026lsquocock-up\u0026rsquo - Sinn Fein lash outIf the House of Commons is going to have a meaningful vote on a deal, on which this legal advice is very, very important, then I think people are entitled to know what that advice is, said the party\u0027s chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.He futher added to Mrs May\u0027s headaches by warning her she cannot rely on his party\u0027s 10 MPs voting to support her deal - despite the agreement that they prop up her minority administration in crunch votes.Sir Jeffrey rejected assumptions his party would not do anything to hasten a snap election - which Labour will seek if the deal is rejected - because it does not want to risk Jeremy Corbyn, who has past links with Irish republicans, becoming PM.Sir Jeffrey told the BBC:\u0026nbsp If we think a Brexit deal is not good for the UK, we will say so. Let\u0027s see what the deal is. We\u0027re not afraid of a general election.Former Conservative PM David Cameron said he fully supported Theresa May (Image: Jack Taylor WPA Pool  Getty Images)I\u0027m quite happy to go to the people of Northern Ireland on the basis that we voted against a deal because it was not in the interests of Northern Ireland. We want the UK to stay together, and we are not alone in this.Former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair in Portugal repeated his call for a second referendum to give people the chance to avoid Brexit, in either its pointless or a painful form.He said a referendum would be best if Parliament rejected Mrs May\u0027s deal, because the Tories would not want an election and a no-deal Brexit was obviously absurd.Former Conservative PM David Cameron was spotted in Whitehall heading to the Treasury to see documents for his memoirs. He said he fully supported what Mrs May was doing and wanted to let her get on with the job.BREXIT SNATCH: Germany\u0027s Bundesliga to EXPLIOT Hard Brexit and overtake Premier League            "},{"url":null,"title":"royal","story":"PRINCE Charles will celebrate his 70th birthday with a huge party at Buckingham Palace on...SARAH Ferguson has opened about relationships with her “boyfriends” in an emotional interview...CAMILLA, Duchess of Cornwall, was showered with gifts when she and husband Prince Charles met...MEGHAN Markle has hired the same interior designer as David and Victoria Beckham to refurbish...MEGHAN Markle declared “feminism is about fairness” as the Duchess of Sussex used her overseas...MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry will be expecting their first baby in Spring next year – and the...KATE, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s wardrobe has taken an unexpected twist with bolder colours and...KATE, Duchess of Cambridge, seemed to channel sister-in-law Meghan Markle as she donned a blazer...MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry rejected 10 versions of the song Stand By Me before they finally...QUEEN ELIZABETH is the longest-reigning British monarch, but will hand over the reins to Prince..."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/183x122/1039527_1.jpg","title":"Queen Elizabeth news Tony Blair offended Queen royal news","story":"Every week, nervously sweating Prime Ministers must report to Buckingham Palace for an audience with the Queen about the planned political events of the week.In royal documentary \u0026ldquoThe Queen and Her Prime Ministers, it was shown that former Prime Minister Tony Blair made a slip about the confidential meeting with the Queen in front of shocked guests.\u0026nbspThese meetings are strictly confidential, according to Michael Cockerell: \u0026ldquoIt has never ever leaked from Buckingham Palace what the Queen has said to a Prime Minister or a Prime Minister to the Queen.Queen Elizabeth II was dismayed he broke one of the cardinal rules of Government by repeating what was said in the confidential meetings.

Others suggest earthen ramps were used and then dismantled.\u0026nbspFour years ago Dutch scientists proposed that wetting the sand had allowed the mighty blocks to be pulled across the desert with minimal friction by a human-powered contraption.Perhaps the mystery has been solved at last with a new discovery by a team of Anglo-French archeologists who suggest a stone ramp with wooden posts enabled much larger blocks than previously thought to be levered up in a kind of pulley system - rather like the idea suggested by the visionary director of the 1950s Hollywood film, Land Of The Pharaohs, in which Joan Collins played an Egyptian queen.The archeologists have recently found just such a ramp in an ancient alabaster quarry in Egypt where stones of a similar size to those in the pyramids were lifted.With the new discovery, we look at 10 things you never knew about the mighty Egyptian monuments.1 GLITTERING VENEER\u0026nbspWhile the giant constructions at Giza are the most famous Egyptian pyramids, in fact as many as 140 pyramids in total have been discovered in Egypt.These grand tombs were originally covered with casing stones made of highly polished white limestone, quarried across the Nile, which has now eroded.\u0026nbspThese stones reflected the sun\u0027s light and were intended to make the pyramids shine like jewels. This is why the ancient Egyptians referred to them as Ikhet or Glorious Light.A scene from the film Land Of The Pharaohs (Image: AF archive  Alamy Stock Photo)2 100,000 LABOURERS\u0026nbspThey were built by 100,000 workers and, until Lincoln Cathedral was built in 1311, the Great Pyramid held the title of the world\u0027s tallest manmade structure for 3,871 years.It is estimated to weigh six million tonnes.\u0026nbspContrary to popular belief, the pyramids were probably built not by slaves or prisoners but by regular paid workers.\u0026nbspEach pyramid would have taken 200 years to build, requiring the labour of generations of workers as the symmetrical structures slowly rose from the hot sand.                Great Pyramid of Giza building mystery solved by new discovery3 COOL INTERIORInside the Egyptian pyramids, the temperature stays at a relatively constant 20C due to the thickness of the walls.4 GRANITE PORTCULLIS\u0026nbspThe Great Pyramid originally contained a stone portcullis to deter grave robbers.\u0026nbspThese hanging granite blocks were suspended in the antechamber to the King\u0027s chamber. Lowered after the funeral ceremony, they blocked access to the tomb and its treasures.\u0026nbspHowever, the system failed when robbers chiselled away the granite blocks and climbed around them.

Mystery of 24 alien black-boxes discovered near Egypt\u0026rsquos Great Pyramids                Great Pyramid of Giza mystery finally solved?7 PERFECT GEOMETRY\u0026nbspThe Great Pyramid of Khufu, otherwise known as the Great pyramid, is not only the largest pyramid ever built, it also has the most complicated inner structure of all pyramids.And it is clear from the construction of the King\u0027s chamber that the engineers who designed it had worked out part of Pythagoras\u0027 theorem - that the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal opposite the right angled corner) of a right-angled triangle was equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides - 2,000 years before the Greek philosopher was born.\u0026nbspThis is revealed by the measurements of the chamber which has a floor plan of 10 x 20 Royal cubits (5.24m x 10.48m) but a height of 10.172 Royal cubits (5.33m).Experts were puzzled as to why the height of the chamber was not also a whole number - 10 Royal cubits, for example.\u0026nbspBut it is clear that this was due to mathematical genius on the part of the master builder who knew how to build right angles long before Pythagoras elaborated his theorem.\u0026nbspFor in fact the diagonal measurement of the side wall is exactly 15 Royal cubits, and the diagonal through the whole room is exactly 25 Royal cubits - enabling the creation of a right-angled chamber.8 PREPARED FOR THE AFTERLIFEThe pyramids at Giza and elsewhere were designed to care for the spirit of the deceased pharaohs who had ruled over Ancient Egypt.\u0026nbspA portion of his spirit known as ka was believed to remain within a corpse and proper care was necessary in order to enable a former pharaoh to perform his new duty as a king of the dead.\u0026nbspThe embalmed body was entombed along with various items he would need in the afterlife upon his transformation and ascension. A number of pyramids include boat pits, with ships - ready for a seafaring astral future.\u0026nbspAt the Great Pyramid of Giza, one of these ships has been restored and is on display.

In fact, it\u0027s the most accurately aligned to true north of any structure on Earth.\u0026nbspDespite being constructed about 4,500 years ago it faces north with just 360th degree of error. However, this is believed to be because the North Pole shifts over time.\u0026nbspAt the time of its construction it was estimated to be spot on, despite being built three millennia before the first compasses were used in navigation during China\u0027s Song Dynasty of the 11th century.Sudan: the country has twice as many pyramids as Egypt does (Image: DeAgostiniGetty Images)10 SUDAN HAS THE MOST\u0026nbspEgypt does not have the only claim to pyramids. In fact, there is a country with twice as many pyramids: Sudan.\u0026nbspEight hundred years after the Ancient Egyptians stopped building their pyramids, came a burst of pyramid-building in the Kingdom of the Kush - an ancient African kingdom in what is now the Republic of Sudan.\u0026nbspAfter the fall of the 24th Egyptian dynasty, the Kingdom of Kush arose as the leading power in the middle Nile region - and their rulers wanted pyramids of their own.\u0026nbspThe Meroe Nubian pyramids - of which there are more than 350 - are to be found 125 miles from the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, although they are rarely seen by tourists due to their isolated location.

We want to see vibrant hubs where people live, shop, use services, and come together.I recognise that these challenges are linked. Empty shops and decreasing footfall on the high street can contribute to social problems such as crime, unemployment and loneliness, while successful high streets can make communities stronger.That is why this week I am launching the new Open Doors project to help regenerate the high street and support community groups.The scheme will match landlords of vacant commercial units with community groups offering vital services to younger and older people. The aim is to reduce loneliness among our most vulnerable members of the community, whilst increasing footfall in town centres.We know that there are already some really successful examples of landlords working with community groups to provide premises on a temporary basis, to the benefit of both parties.However, we know that landlords may not be aware of the benefits of these arrangements, and community groups may not know who to approach or how to negotiate a temporary contract.This Open Doors scheme will help to overcome these barriers and bring vital services, as well as footfall, to local high streets.This announcement follows the Chancellor’s Autumn Budget which confirmed a new £. billion plan to support and transform the high street.In July this year, we asked Sir John Timpson, a businessman with more than three decades’ experience of what makes our high streets tick, to look at what’s needed to respond to issues currently affecting the high street.He recommended we set up a national body to strengthen local leadership and establish a new fund to support the renewal and reshaping of town centres.So, in this Budget provided a new £ million Future High Street Fund to help local areas adapt to changes and to prepare long-term strategies.The money will help improve transport links, redevelop empty shops, and restore historic properties, keeping our high streets fit for generations to come.We’ve also established a new High Streets Taskforce to help local leaders prepare and implement new strategies for their town centres.Small retail businesses will see their business rates bills cut by a third, saving them up to £ million over two years.These actions will help create a more level playing field for all retailers.It’s against this optimistic backdrop that I will outline my vision for communities at next week’s Locality Convention.I have been clear about my department’s priorities – building the homes this country needs, supporting and strengthening communities, and boosting local growth.Our resolve to deliver on these commitments has been bolstered by a bold budget.Our communities and our high streets will not be left behind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For most, the biggest thing they want politicians to tackle in their own lives is the cost of living. The more the taxman takes, the harder it gets to cope.Yet when you talk to ordinary people about tax, you find out that it is not a financial issue. It’s a moral one.They’re not greedy. Or selfish. They know the NHS needs money. And the police.But they also know thatthe state takes too much of what you earn, you’re not going to bother earning it in the first place.So they think that you should always workyou can — but that it should always pay to work. Andthe Government is taking more than half, you’re working for them, not for you.That’s why our think tank, the Centre for Policy Studies, is urging ministers to embrace two vital principles, outlined in our latest report.First, you shouldn’t have to pay tax before you’ve earned the bare minimum. One of the best things the Conservatives have done — inspired by our think tank — was to raise the amount you can earn before you pay income tax. At the most recent Budget, Philip Hammond hiked it to £, a year — from just £, back in .But there’s a sting in the tail. People aren’t paying income tax — but they’re still paying National Insurance, which is income tax by another name. We estimate that .million people have been “taken out of tax” — but are actually still paying it.And there’s another problem — at least for the politicians. Raising the personal allowance has kept take-home pay above water since the financial crisis.But just nine per cent of those we and YouGov surveyed knew it had gone up by that much, and  per cent said they hadn’t noticed it in their pay packet.That may be why just  per cent told us the Tories were the party of low taxes.That’s why we suggest a new universal basic income, a new right, for every worker, that the first £, a month will be free of both income tax and National Insurance. That’s a £ tax cut, which takes those .million people out of tax completely. And it should be front-and-centre on every pay packet.The next idea is just as important. It is that the taxman should let you keep at least p of every extra £ you earn — a work guarantee.At the moment, our tax system is riddled with points where you suddenly face a great big spike in what you pay.For the rich, it happens when your salary hits £,, and your tax rate soars to  per cent as that personal allowance is clawed back.But the biggest victims are those trying to come off welfare into work. In some cases, they only get to keep p in every extra £. So it’s no wonder they’re tempted to give up.This happens because even as the tax system gives, the benefits system tries to claw it back. That’s why we’re asking the Government to cut the rate at which Universal Credit is withdrawn to p in the £, to ensure it always pays you to climb the income ladder.Of course, this kind of thing costs money. We don’t want to copy Labour and go back to borrowing billions that we can’t afford. Or to scrimp on the NHS.But given the Government is spending more than £BILLION a year, there’s certainly room for some savings.For example, we currently spend £billion a year trying to encourage people to chip into a pension — yet have the lowest savings rate since records began. And that cash is spent woefully inefficiently — because the relief is based on your original tax bill, the top one per cent get as much help as the bottom  per cent, even though they need much less incentive to save.Replacing the current pension with an ISA-style system, where you got an up-front bonus for saving, would be simpler and more effective — and save us billions that we could use to help people right now.Andthe Government doesn’t like that idea, we’ve got plenty more.A forthcoming report of ours identies a dozen ideas for saving public money, adding up to £billion a year — from pegging Whitehall’s admin costs to the private sector, to eliminating wasteful and economically distorting subsidies, to reducing duplication in local government.Eventhe Government thinks it can’t find the money now, it needs to put making work pay at the heart of its future decisions. Not least because it is wildly popular.The universal working income is backed by  per cent to nine per cent. The work guarantee by  per cent to  per cent. These aren’t Tory ideas, they’re backed overwhelmingly by voters across the board.Perhaps that’s because these ideas embody what we all know to be true. Everyone who can work, should work. But people will only workit pays them to do so.The job for the politicians is to make damn sure it does.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Backstop means backstop.“Today we’re not there yet. Frankly we don’t have the advantage of a lot more time.”Downing Street said leaked plans for a media blitz of foreign leaders, business chiefs and Whitehall wonks to try sell the PMs deal was not a genuine government document.The timetable, riddled with spelling errors, set out a day by day attempt to win over MPs ahead of a crunch Commons vote pencilled in for  November.It included bringing in Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and the CBI to endorse her plans and predicted a moment of decisive progress would be announced by Brexit Secretary.However No rejected the timetable and a Whitehall source added the assumption is that someone took crude notes at the back of a war gaming meeting which have been going on for at least a couple of weeks.In a further headache for the PM last night, the powerful ERG bloc of Brexiteer Tory MPs warned they any Treasury statistics used to try browbeat them into backing a deal could not be trusted.Jacob Rees Mogg told fellow hardliners: the Government must show its workings to parliament.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One female onlookershrieks, “Help me! Help me!” as the others laugh, while someone  boasts: “I made the burning people.”It’s not just that it’s shockingly distasteful, it’s the sheer callousness of it that renders one almost speechless with disbelief.Then there’s the group of lads in their late teens who thought it funny to spit at Janice Morris as she sat alone on a park bench, before later pelting her with flour and eggs.When police — who class her as vulnerable and with mental health issues — visited her Suffolk home later that day, they found her still covered in flour and with “smudged mascara down her face”.One of the gang — -year-old Cohan Semple — saw fit to take a photo of the attack and posted it on Snapchat.One recipient reposted it to Facebook, it went viral and, quite rightly, prompted widespread revulsion and a police investigation.All five have pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour which caused harassment, alarm or distress and await sentencing.Meanwhile, it seems “dozens” of the Remembrance Day “Silent Silhouette” statues placed all over the country have been defaced or smashed up by mindless vandals. In Devon alone, one statue was snapped in half, another five vandalised and one stolen.Oh how we wish that,caught in the act, their punishment could be a few weeks on the frontline of a war zone. But don’t hold your breath.Instead, let’s focus on the good in society that, thankfully, still forms the majority. The thousands who expressed their abject disgust at the breathtakingly inhumane bonfire stunt, the horried locals in Bury St Edmunds who helped police locate Miss Morris and bring her tormentors to justice, and the noble volunteers who, seeing the damage to the Silent Silhouette statues, stepped in to repair them in time for this weekend’s Remembrance Sunday.Volunteers such as a group of teenagers in Axminster, Devon, who took a vandalised “Tommy” in to their school workshop and repaired him.Placing him back at the scene afterwards, they laid a wreath and declared: “We are here today to show you that we, as young people, do care.“We care about the sacrices made by the brave men and women who fought for our country.”So let’s take comfort that the true measure of British society lies in their actions and not those of a few morons.“Dry Martini service trolley”, anyone  Nope, me neither.As for the hand-stitched couture Valentino gown, the site describes it as “a dress that defies adjectives”.Oh, I don’t know. “Bloody expensive” comes to mind.MODEL and self-publicist extraordinaire Emily Ratajkowski has published this photo with the caption: “Laundry day.”Cripes.

In the interests of clarity, one should perhaps point out the bag was for the dog, not Ant himself. But I digress.The aide’s role reminds me of the old joke about the circus worker whose job it was to clean up prolic amounts of elephant dung.When asked whether he’d ever considered another line of work, he replied: “What – and give up showbiz ”THIS photo of Tom Cruise reprising his role as Maverick for the Top Gun sequel suggests he hasn’t aged at all in the intervening -plus years.Or perhaps it’s simply the wonderfully flattering gravitational pull of a high-speed motorbike.YOU know you’re famous when your No fan is Adele.When she appeared on James Corden’s Carpool karaoke, she was word-perfect on the Spice Girls single Wannabe and said she dreamed of being Ginger Spice.And yesterday, when four of the ladiesannounced a reunion tour, the delightfully down-to-earth Ms Adkins posted a photo of herself, pictured, aged about seven, in front of her bedroom wall papered in their posters and with the caption: “I am ready.”For Adele’s now thirty-something generation, you can’t overestimate the effect of the Spice Girls when they burst on to the pop scene in  with Wannabe.Yes, the “girl power” mantra was a bit cheesy but the point is that for a while they defined the zeitgeist of social change for girls who saw these feisty, opinionated young women having fun primarily on their own terms – and aspired to do the same.They’ve all had their trials and tribulations in the ensuing years . . . but haven’t we all Most of all, the Spice Girls are a mirror of the enduring power of female friendship, with all its twists, turns, complexities, bickering, sniping Mel B and Victoria – who, by the way, are currently speaking and, ultimately, longevity.Welcome back ladies.

The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions attacked the Labour Party saying they could not bring themselves to praise the extra money going into UC. The Government was forced to put more money in after campaigning from the Mirror, MPs and charities. She then read out a list of charities she said had praised the pound.billion injection in to the scheme announced in the budget last week including the Resolution Foundation, and the Child Poverty Action Group. She added: Other charities have been saying that the Department is now listening to what claimants, charities and MPs are saying. The Trussell Trust has said that. Gingerbread has said that. Mind has said that. Mencap has said that. But Mind hit back at her claim. The charity says they have never supported the scheme - even after the recent changes. They are especially concerned that three million people, including hundreds of thousands of people with mental health problems, will be forced to make a new claim. In a Twitter thread the charity explained the many criticisms and warning it has made about the benefits shake-up.  The Mind twitter account stated: Yesterday the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions @EstherMcVey mentioned us in a list of organisations who had recognised and welcomed changes to #UniversalCredit. We thought it was important to set the record straight. They listed the warnings in order showing how they had consistently criticised the policy. Minds Director of External Relations Sophie Corlett expressed concerns when the Government first published its plans for moving people from older benefits onto Universal Credit in July. She said: We are hugely concerned about the ramications of these proposals, which leave open the real possibility that many people with mental health problems could see their benefits stopped entirely while they struggle with the process of applying Universal Credit. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. The thread then moved on to show Minds response to the governments recent budget announcement, via chief executive Paul Farmer, who said: If the government is really intent on prioritising the nations mental health, it needs to guarantee nobody with mental health problems will be left without their income as a result of moving to Universal Credit. The charitys head of Policy Vicki Nash was particularly scathing in her comment after the updated plans were announced. As the thread shows, she said: These regulations have confirmed what we have long feared and argued against - that in the move over to Universal Credit three million people, including hundreds of thousands of people with mental health problems, will be left without income and pushed into poverty. A DWP spokesperson said: The Secretary of State remains absolutely committed to working closely with key charities and stakeholders. She values their feedback and meets with them regularly for constructive discussions as Universal Credit rolls out.

Video footage of the incident has been shared by mum-of-three Deborah Henley, who had been helping the man - known as Tom. She spotted him looking unwell and according to reports he had been discharged from hospital that day following an assault which had left him with three stab wounds. Tom was sat on the steps outside the online retailers Northern Quarter branch in Manchester, trying to warm up with a cup of coffee. But Deborah says shes ashamed about what happened next, the Manchester Evening News reports. She claims she and the homeless man were told by the security guard they had to move, despite the shutters being closed. In the footage, a member of security staff appears to be guarding the closed shutter where the man had been resting. It was clear the man was in a bad way, Deborah said.  Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, Deborah said: It was just shameful, I am so ashamed about what happened. I was waiting in my car and saw a young man looking very unwell sat outside the steps outside. His hands were blue and he clearly wasnt well so I left to get him a coffee. He wasnt begging or asking for money. When I came back, a member of security came out of Boohoo and said we couldnt sit there. She says she told the security guard she had wanted to sit with him whilst he gathered himself, and then they would leave. But she claims she was told that they must clear the doorway immediately. This man had just got out of hospital with three stab wounds, Deborah said. I dont know how anyone could not have allowed a human being to sit there for five minutes. The security guard said that his plastic bags were the problem, butit was a Selfridges bag I doubt it would have mattered.  The pair moved on to the pavement so Tom could sit and finish his coffee, but Deborah claims the guard prevented them from sitting there too. He was bullying us just to get this man moved, she added. It was an upsetting situation as it was but the security guard just wasnt having any of it. I came home and felt really upset so I wrote to Boohoo, but I felt their reply was really weak. There were lots of workers outside smoking and drinking coffee - nobody looked scared or intimidated. Deborah says she believes more needs to be done to provide a place for homeless people to rest and take shelter during daylight hours, especially in the winter months. She said: I have written to Andy Burnham because the message just isnt getting out there. When a man cant even sit on a step and rink a coffee, something is very wrong. The Bed a Night campaign is an excellent idea, but there are still  hours in the day where people have nowhere to sit and rest. I know security staff have got a job to do but there was nobody coming in and out of that door. I understand that these companies have rules but at some point humanity has to prevail. A spokesperson from Boohoo said: Boohoo take the issue of homelessness very seriously, working with the council over the last  months to support and taking part in charity initiatives which help the most vulnerable people in our community. We are aware of the incident and we did politely ask the lady and gentlemen to move away from the steps of our building, as we would anyone to remain vigilant with respect to access to the building. We do apologisethis has caused offence, as that was never our intention.

Nicola Urquhart claims senior officers have been dishonest and that evidence linked to the mystery disappearance of the -year-old is being concealed. Her accusations come weeks after police confirmed the most likely conclusion is that Corrie was taken away in a Bfa bin and to the rubbish tip in Milton, Cambridgeshire, after climbing in the bin and falling asleep. But despite extensive searches of the landfill, a body has never been found. Gran Nicola wrote on the Find Corrie Facebook page: They [police] just hope that by saying all the evidence points to Corrie being there makes it true and us the family and the public will be stupid enough to believe it.  Nicola believes Corrie was not in the bin when he vanished on September  in  after a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. She claims an eyewitness saw Corrie close to where he was last seen and checked the bin and Corrie was not inside. Suffolk police would like me to discount this statement as being untrue, she said. Yetthey feel they have been lied to they have done nothing and refuse to do anything about this. Nicola also claims data regarding the bin weight was interfered with and Corries phone signal on the same route the bin lorry took is absolutely not conclusive and could have been within five miles.  Police previously said the bin weighed kg - much higher than bin collection weights from the same place normally. A Suffolk Police spokesman said last month: Our findings were that the weights of these bins were consistently lowand it was extremely unusual for the Greggs bin collection on a Saturday to be anywhere near KG let alone over this figure. In the whole of this yearly period we identied only one other occasion where the weight exceeded kg, other than a date where a system error had occurred which recorded a weight in excess of KG which is known to be impossible. But Nicola raged today that there was not one trace of DNA on or in the bin, on or in the Bfa lorry. She said: The Bfa raw data was interfered with. It is NOT conclusive fact that the bin was kg.  Evenwe accept it was, in the year from Jan  to Jan  the Greggs bin WAS regularly over kg and frequently over kg. Regardless of what day of the week this was it was still over and Suffolk police have stated as a FACT that it was over  kg on a previous Saturday but this is to be ignored as are all the failed readings and the ones were it was over kg or kg. She continued: Suffolk police being baffled as to why they did not find Corrie and cannot explain it. Nor are they trying too. Meanwhile, Nicola went on to make scathing accusations about police officers claiming: We have been misled and lied to by the senior officers investigating the disappearance of Corrie, they have played word games, played a media game and have tried to only provide us with information that fits their preferred theory at the time.  Corrie is a grown man and is responsible for himself, as i said at the start, he is responsible for his own actions, we as a family are not looking for someone to blame for what has happened to Corrie, we are looking for the truth and we want to find Corrie. In Summary….. It is possible Corrie left on foot and is AWOL….. i do not and have never believed this is probable, Corrie made no plans, had no reason and has never been seen after the immediate sightings. Most importantly, as a family we know thatCorrie could see the way some people are behaving not a single person in the world could stop him from screaming from the rooftops about how he would feel about that.  Corries father Martin heartbreakingly admitted last month my son is gone after police confirmed his sons body was probably in a landfill site. Meanwhile in response to Nicolas allegations, a Suffolk Constabulary spokesman said: “Suffolk Constabulary refutes the allegations made in the Facebook post by Nicola Urquhart that senior officers have been dishonest in their approach. “Everything we have said and done has been in good faith and for the right reasons. We have sought to be as open and transparent as possible with the family. “This investigation was conducted in line with the Code of Ethics. The most likely scenario is that Corrie McKeague unfortunately went into the bin which was emptied into the Bfa lorry and consequently ended up in the waste process. “We have come to this conclusion based on all of the evidence we have available to us, and not just the weight of the bin.  “Our investigation has been reviewed by an outside force and the review agreed that Suffolk Constabulary’s preferred hypothesis of what happened to Corrie was the most likely one given the evidence available. “Suffolk Constabulary has previously stated that unless new, realistic and credible information becomes available then the investigation is complete. There is no information available at this time that changes the status of the investigation.”  Nicolas Facebook post in full: Instead of replying inidually to each private message i thought it would be easier to put a post up, as most of you are asking the same type of questions. It is very hard to explain simply as i can’t describe the last  years in a short post. My aim here is to explain why myself and my family will not move on and try to forget about Corrie, we are not ready to remember Corrie, we are still fighting for him. This is because we have been misled and lied to by the senior officers investigating the disappearance of Corrie, they have played word games, played a media game and have tried to only provide us with information that fits their preferred theory at the time. I would like to make the distinction now, that it is not and has never been rank and file officers, nor is it the entire force. It is the senior officers that have spoken to myself and my sons and the officers above them that have decided to run the investigation into my son the way they have. I am incredibly grateful for the huge amount of effort that has been put into trying to find Corrie and this is not a post that in hindsight it is simply me looking back and complaining now, as you all know I have been very vocal from the start when i disagree or cannot understand why decisions have been made the way they have been. but hopefully it will explain things. Corrie is a grown man and is responsible for himself, as i said at the start, he is responsible for his own actions, we as a family are not looking for someone to blame for what has happened to Corrie, we are looking for the truth and we want to find Corrie. POSSIBLE, PROBABLE and EVIDENCE  words that have been used quite a lot. i will talk about this later. Corrie walked into the rear loading bays behind Greggs in Bury St Edmunds. that is a fact. Wewere told in the first phone calls from Suffolk Police that they were at that stage .% sure Corrie could not leave the area without being caught on CCTV, and the area Corrie had walked into was a dead end. I asked about assistance from the RAF and I was told the RAF had said it was not their problem, This was absolutely not what I was being told by the most senior member of the RAF at the time, when I pointed this out I was then told “ it wouldn’t be fair on other families of missing people, they wouldn’t get the same as Corrie. ” this was the excuse I was given for Suffolk Police not asking for more assistance from the RAF who were desperate to help and had offered assistance at no cost. but the RAF cannot be involved unless requested by the police force investigating. Moving on, we were told Corrie had not gone in the Bfa lorry as the weight was too light kg. we were also then told it was impossible for Corrie to leave the area without being caught on CCTV.During this time, this was also what I was telling all of you, as for as far as I am concerned in a missing person enquiry ALL information should be put out to the public. I was begging Suffolk Police during this time not to give back the landfill to FCC as it was too soon, I was not saying I wanted it searched, just that it was far to soon to give up as even at this stage I could not see how they were so confident in the kg weight. I was at a meeting with Suffolk Police when they showed me images of the male in the black and white t shirt that was in Pizza Mama Mia and i was told the police were looking for this male as they had not identied him yet. . I said i would put his image on the find Corrie page and i was asked not to as they didn’t want to start asking people who he was yet, as they wanted to stagger the information. this was something I was most certainly not happy with so I put a description and photograph of the t shirt the male was wearing on the find Corrie page and the male in question contacted me immediately telling me it was him. he also described his full night and everything he knew about Corrie. I immediately passed this on to the police and they spoke to him, however never got half the story I did. i questioned this and showed them the messages I had been sent. the male was spoken to again and told not to talk to me. yet he in my eyes had done nothing wrong and was only trying to help. During this time I was told that although Corrie’s phone had been logged at Five Roads Roundabout at Barton Mills the area between there and Honington was  square miles and too large for the Police to search. that only with a phone ping it was not a reasonable request to have the area searched, even though this was an area Corrie knew and the RAF used to tab train the airmen. It was agreed by Police for the searches by SULSAR with the assistance of the public could take place. After insisting that the images of the people the police were searching for were shown to the public it was finally agreed that the police would put a pod up in Bury showing these images. it was during this time I met Colin Davey, he informed me that he had already offered a reward to Suffolk Police for me and they had refused him, he insisted and they said they would tell me but they did not, I spoke with the senior officer in charge and asked him about this and he said he had no knowledge, it was later ascertained the police did know about the offer but in their opinion felt it wasn’t worth telling me. I then spoke frequently about getting this reward made public, after speaking with Colin on numerous occasions and on every occasion i was stopped by police and told i should wait, what I didn’t know was at the same time they were talking to someone  about a much smaller reward they now wanted to put up and were assisting them every way they could. I informed the police that a press conference was about to take place and they pretended they had no knowledge while all the time they knew exactly what was about to be said and offered yet I was still being told not to put up a reward. yet again another time Suffolk Police were playing games and not simply trying everything in their power to find Corrie and to have everyone working together and not one constantly attacking. One of the big sticking points in the Reward that Colin had offered was that the police would not and could not answer the phones  hours a day. we spoke atabout this and how it could be resolved. I offered to pay officers and for a line to be opened but it was all refused so an agreement was made that i would have my own phones. It was on one of these calls that I received myself that i was provided with information relating to persons killing Corrie and putting him in the Greggs bin and Corrie ultimately ending up in the landfill. This as with ALL information that was received was passed on to Suffolk Police, I was told to keep this new information secret while it was investigated as the police took this information extremely seriously. This in my opinion caused Suffolk police to go back and start looking at the bin weight and the processes of Bfa again, it was only after this they then decided to start the search of the Landfill. With all this going on I had been lied to by senior officers about facts of the case surrounding vehicles and had been deliberately misled about other things. I was updating you all during this time with what I believed were facts as I had been told them, Suffolk Police have always been happy for it to appear that it is me that is changing my story, i believe to attack my credibility, whilst all the time they refused to say anything to the media as they knew they had a puppet repeating what they wanted to be put out in social media and the press. The search at the landfill started, I was still questioning why this was happening and was being told it was not , but when they would find Corrie. The language the police were using was CERTAIN. and to my utter regret, i believed them and stopped asking all my other questions. Suffolk Police searched the landfill, the entire area they believed Corrie may have been and did not find a single item of evidence to suggest Corrie was ever there, yet they did find rubbish from the time and dates Corrie went missing and from the Bury area. I have no doubt what so ever thatVince and his team searching would have found Corrie or any items belonging to Corriethey had been there, I visited them, at the site and spoke with them, I just didn’t feel the need to seek attention for it. Whilst there I was told they did not believe Corrie was there, they were not going to find him. I was also told other things but i won’t share them just now. Suffolk Police then found out that the weights were wrong, the bin actually weighted kg and this was so exceptional it could only mean Corrie was in that bin that night, again I have asked and been shown so much data from Bfa and on each occasion it has dramatically changed from the time before. it has never remained consistent at all. It was only  years after my son had gone missing that we were finally showed the REAL raw data and even then it showed, contrary to the misleading statements that have been put out there that the Bfa bin for Greggs ARE regularly over kg. In the year Corrie went missing I am supposed to ignore so many occasions that the bin was over kg with no explanation at all.I have never been given any explanation as to why it was only the one night when a Bfa member of staff a week after Corrie went missing interfered with the weights of the bins. In the whole year this was the ONLY occasion. Suffolk police are happy to move on from this. I am not. It was also only at this last meeting I was also informed that ACTUALLY CORRIE COULD HAVE LEFT THE AREA WITHOUT BEING SEEN ON CCTV. Suffolk Police cannot confirm Corrie wasn’t given a lt out of the area. ALL they can say is they didn’t see him leave before am, after that, they have NOT even looked!!! as they do not have the CCTV, they never even asked for it. We have been shown CCTV of people in the area of the horseshoe just after Corrie walked in there, all are wearing dark clothing you then see them leaving the area and one is clearly wearing white or very light coloured trousers. These people leave the area walking down Short Brackland street immediately after the bin lorry left. The Bin Lorry Driver confirms seeing Corrie in his statement and not being there along with the others he had seen when he drove out, this is also confirmed by CCTV as it shows these people leaving the area. I am expected to believe that these people changed there clothes and it wasn’t Corrie.This is no where close to all the information I have, or the problems we have had to endure and the unbelievable unneeded stress and heartache Suffolk Police have put us under as a family. In Summary….. It is possible Corrie left on foot and is AWOL….. i do not and have never believed this is probable, Corrie made no plans, had no reason and has never been seen after the immediate sightings. most importantly, as a family we know thatCorrie could see the way some people are behaving not a single person in the world could stop him from screaming from the rooftops about how he would feel about that. Had it been Darroch or Makeyan that had gone missing there is no way on this world I could have expected the same restraint at the disgust and anger they feel and to keep quiet from Corrie, any one that knows Corrie at all, knows just how true this statement is. Corrie is NOT in the landfill, and never was, forensics, a search of Red Lodge, a search of the entire Landfill shows this. I have spoken atwith the staff at Red lodge and I firmly believe that had Corrie been dropped there by the Bfa bin the staff there would have seen him. There is also the search carried out by Suffolk Police,Corrie was there, they would have found him, they have in fact proven to me beyond all reasonable doubt that he was never there. So along with the statements, the evidence of statements and CCTV it shows Corrie leaving the area on foot, this is also where a now proven search dog traced Corrie, walking down Short Brackland and out of Bury along the A. There are discussions going on just now with a charity search Dive team that can do searches of water that SULSAR are unable to do along with the searches that SULSAR have been carrying out and areas that still need to be searched. This is what is POSSIBLE and what is PROBABLE. Sadly we are left as a family feeling very let down by a profession that I am so so very proud to be a part of. Suffolk Police gave up searching for Corrie in November  everything since has simply been lip service to us and you. I hoped the mistakes would have been a learning experience and would never happen again, but sadly this is not what has happened. I have been out searching for Corrie myself along this road and I will continue to do all I can to make sure it is searched and my son is found. I will not give up, neither will Corrie’s brothers or our family. I will also do all i possibly can to make sure no other mother, brother, daughter, family or friend ever has to go through what we have been put through, Corrie going missing is the most heartbreaking tragic thing that has ever happened to us as a family but what Suffolk Police have put us through has been unimaginable and unforgivable. but most importantly unnessarry i have tried on so many occasion privately to get them to behave in a way that would give the public they serve some confidence, sadly they appear to me to have lost sight of that and do not wish to do anything to encourage that trust and belief, that saddens me as I know it will not be how the majority of their force feels. I know this is a fact from the officers that have contacted me privately. Again I have not covered anywhere close to all the information I have, nor all the things that Suffolk Police have done or not done. I will continue to live in hope that lessons can be learnt and there is no need for me to publicly say everything. Thank you all so very much for your continued amazing support Nicola, Makeyan, Corrie and Darroch x x x x "},{"url":null,"title":"ever suspected your neighbours smoking","story":"NewsEver suspected your neighbours of smoking or growing cannabis  Here are the steps you can takeThe notoriously pungent stench may be a sign of a recreational user smoking the odd joint next door or the drug being grown in large quantities close byShareCommentsByChris MallettOliver AstleyColleen Smith:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video you-think-your-neighbours-smoking-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNightmare neighbours smoking cannabis inside their own homes is a common problem for communities across Britain.

The stricken -year-old was found on Tuesday by his son, Simon Gouldstone, who was alerted by a concerned member of the public to the fact the back door to his fathers home was open. Simon told ITV London: I dont know how they can live with themselves. Peter was a former Post Office employee who has lived on his own since  when his we Joan died.  He is now in a critical but stable condition. Son Simon Gouldstone said: My Dad is housebound and requires regular assistance.He has lived at his address for over  years.

Detective Inspector Paul Ridley said of the incident: It was a brutal and senseless attack on a pensioner in his own home, who has lived there for over  years without ever having to endure a horric incident like this. The level of violence used was completely excessive. He was left helpless and seriously injured at the address all alone. It was only due to a member of the public recognising damage to the property that the alarm was raised and he was discovered.  Worried neighbours, many of whom are also pensioners, today expressed their concern at the attack and robbery. It affects you because its worrying. Its callous. Who could have done this to an old man like him, said Pio Gomes, , who lives nearby. One woman, who wants to remain anonymous, said she noticed the dads garage door was open yesterday morning, which was unusual.

Scampi Fries, Frazzles and tomato soup also emerged among a list of goods those who have left our shores cannot live without. According to figures released by British Corner Shop, Brits who now live in Australia are rushing to cram their cupboards with Shreddies and oxtail soup. Expats who now enjoy le in the U.S are opting for Heinz baked beans, Warburtons Crumpets and Robinsons squash.

Kirsty Maxwell, , was on a hen weekend in the Spanish resort when the tragedy happened. Her family has since supported an extensive probe into her death after it emerged five British men were staying in the apartment from which Kirsty fell. But samples taken from under the bank workers fingernails, hands and armpits contain no foreign DNA, experts have revealed. And it now paves the way for Ana Isabel Garcia-Galbis in Spain to consider ending her -month criminal probe. A well-placed source in the country said today: The family had placed their hopes in the possibility something was going to be found, some biological evidence linking Joseph Graham or the other suspects to what happened and supporting their foul play claim, and absolutely nothing has been found.  It was a comprehensive examination which included analysis of the underside of Kirsty’s nails to seesamples of someone’s  skin could be recovered that might suggest a struggle had taken place. All the tests came back negative. The absence of any incriminating DNA on Kirsty’s body means the case is a step nearer to being closed. No decision on closure is obviously going to be taken before the upcoming court hearings but bar some sort of unexpected surprise, things are a lot nearer that point now.  The five Brits being probed over Kirsty’s death, including -year-old Joseph Graham who was the only man arrested, would be spared trialthe case is closed and only a successful appeal by Kirsty’s family to a higher court could get it re-opened. Two of the men, from Nottingham, have been called to court today to give evidence. Eight police officers have been asked to attend a second hearing on Thursday November , which was originally understood to have been scheduled for October .  Both hearings will take place behind closed doors, as is customary in Spain where only trials take place in public. Kirsty, of Livingston, Scotland, died in April , just seven months after marrying Adam Maxwell. The grieving widower previously said: I won’t rest until I know the truth.

The video starts with the victims white Audi Q ploughing into bollards outside the Aubery Road GP surgery in Small Heath, Birmingham. He drove the car across the pavement after being chased in a stolen pick-up truck. The victim - who could not think of a motive afterwards - can be seen climbing up onto the wall in a bid to get his mother out of the car safely. He was dropping her off for a doctors appointment at the time. The three thugs jumped out of the vehicle and and one of them charged at him with a -inch machete. His mum tried to stop them, tugging at them as he was assaulted in broad daylight. But the violence escalated and kneman Amir Hussain slashed at the unnamed victims stomach. The panicked victim can be seen falling to the floor before getting up holding his stomach and trying to flee the scene. Meanwhile, a nurse came out of the surgery to help save his le. Amir Hussain and two brothers Zain Islan and Hussan Yousaf have now been jailed over the attack, which came seemingly without motive.They were sentenced to a total of  years after West Midlands Police traced them to a hotel in Yorkshire. The trio were found in near Sheffield on June  − a fortnight after they left the victim with shocking injuries on May . At Birmingham Crown Court on Monday Hussain was jailed for  years while Islam and Yousaf were handed -year sentences.  Investigating officer Detective Constable Darren English said: This was a savage attack that left the victim with le threatening injuries − in fact, had it not been for the swt actions of a nurse who ran to his aid he may well have died. The Fiat x passed the victim’s Audi Q moments after he set off to take his mum to the doctor. It reversed at speed for about  metres before swinging into a driveway and giving chase. The victim − who has not been able to provide a motive for attack − was understandably panicked and in his bid to get away collided with bollards and a wall. He pleaded with the men − who he knew from the local area − for calm and urged them not to hurt his mother. But Hussain immediately began hitting out with the machete. The victim was placed in an induced coma and thankfully pulled through following surgery − but he has been left with scarring and the psychological impact of such a traumatic event.

The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for rain and flooding as a super storm is expected to unleash weather misery for three days. And the wild weather may last up to three weeks, through the rest of autumn and into the winter months. Downpours brought in by strong low-pressure systems swirling in the Atlantic will bring in torrential rain through into tomorrow morning. Tropical air brought in on a supercharged jet stream will see temperatures rise dramatically leading to more ‘convective’ downpours over the next two days. However, Britons are bracing themselves for the ,-mile wide pressure vortex spanning the Atlantic threatening widespread disruption and weather misery on Friday.  Met Office forecasters are watching the swirling vortex closely which could lead to the fourth named storm of the season – Deirdre. The giant low pressure vortex could see mm of rain dumped, disrupting the south and west throughout the weekend, with wet and windy conditions continuing into next week. A yellow warning has been put in place for wind and rain from midnight tonight until Friday afternoon, when Storm Deirdre is expected to unleash the worst of its weather. Flooding, cancelled trains, ferries and buses, as well as delayed car journeys have be predicted as a result of the wild weather.  Ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond said: “This week, a huge vortex of low pressure in the eastern Atlantic will see the jet stream fling a succession of wet and windy spells towards UK. “The potential for disruptive winds needs to be watched. Western parts are most prone. Several wet spells are expected.” It comes as Britons have been urged to batten down the hatches as five more storms look set to lash the country before Christmas in what could be a record breaking year. So far three storms have hit the country this Autumn, with Ali and Bronagh arriving in September and Callum the month after.  Ex-hurricane Oscar’s mph gusts cancelled fireworks displays in the north of England. As Christmas nears five more storms are forecast to land according to The Weather Company, the worlds biggest commercial forecaster. They will be called Deirdre, Erik, Freya, Gareth and Hannah. If the turbulent weather does materialise it would make  a record breaking one, with eight named storms hitting the UK in the year up until Christmas.  In  - the year storms were first named - five landed, followed by two in  and three in . Leon Brown, head of meteorological operations at The Weather Company’s Weather Channel arm, said: “Four more named Atlantic storms are expected by early December, plus the risk of a fth named storm before Christmas. “Travel disruption and wind gusts over mph in parts of the North and West are expected. “A stormy, mobile Atlantic pattern is forecast in early winter, before a colder pattern from New Year onwards as westerly winds ease.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror welfare state food","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Welfare is in a state as food bank use soarsThe Government should abandon Universal Credit - but the Tories dont care about the victims they createShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsopinionPeople have been forced to live off food banks \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe soaring use of food banks is a stain on our country, with charities forced to care for people abandoned by a welfare state that is punched full of holes.

It feels like ministers enjoy revelling in the hardship inflicted, wrongly blaming the unfortunate for their plight. Universal credit requires a fundamental overhaul, yet all the Conservatives do is tinker and look the other way as children become collateral damage when families are hit with merciless, arbitrary penalties.

Beth Craigs says she was left in agony after having the procedure, which was carried out by a woman renting a chair at a Newcastle salon. And now she wants to urge others to think twice about who they are getting their lip fillers injected by. Beth, from Wallsend, is one of several women who said they got a bad treatment from the woman, reports Chronicle Live. Questions have now been raised over the woman’s registration and qualications and whether she was actually allowed to carry out the treatment.  The woman took bookings through private message on Facebook but since being contacted by unhappy customers appears to have now deleted her page and disconnected her phone. Beth said: “It was my first time getting them done so I didn’t know what to expect after getting them done. “But afterwards there was massive swelling and they were extremely painful. I was really sore and my jaw and face were aching.  “The pain was so bad and then they went rock solid, like concrete, and I could not move my lips. “I contacted her and she said to massage them and wait for  days. “She said I had signed a disclaimer about swelling and I said yes, but they shouldn’t go like concrete. “I kept saying I couldn’t massage them because they are so painful. “I contacted a doctor and he looked at them and said it was not normal.” Beth, who works as a beauty therapist, had to take steroids and has paid hundreds of pounds for injections to dissolve what was put into her lips.  “He had to inject something into them to make them dissolve and I have to go back again because they still aren’t right,” Beth said. Now, she is warning others to make sure they check the person giving lip fillers is qualied. “Anyone could be doing it,” she said. “I wish I had checked. It should be a nurse, doctor or dentist you go to.” Doctor Steve Land, who owns Novellus Aesthetics in Jesmond, Newcastle, and fixed Beth’s lips, said: “Essentially, the problem is there are no regulations on who can give lip fillers. People can just set up their own clinics. “This problem has been going on for a while and I don’t quite know how to fix it unless there is Government intervention. You should make sure you go to a qualied doctor or nurse to get treatment. Anyone with the right qualications will have them on display.” A city council spokesperson said their Trading Standards team is aware of the issue and investigating.

Maureen Pacheco was in hospital for a back operation when the blunder happened. According to a lawsuit, the Palm Beach Post reports, Pacheco was not told that the tumour was going to be removed. The -year-old woke up from anaesthesia to discover that her kidney had been taken out by mistake. She checked into the Wellington Regional Hospital in Florida on April , , for back surgery, having suffered problems for years following a car crash. The patient was in hospital to have bones in her lower back fused. Surgeon Dr Ramon Vazquez could lose his medical license, according to reports in the US.  Pacheco met the surgeon shortly before being wheeled into the operating room.Vazquez’s job was to cut her open so her orthopaedic surgeons could perform the delicate back operation. Pacheco’s attorney, Donald J. Ward, told the Palm Beach Post: “As you can imagine, when someone goes in for a back surgery, she would never expect to wake up and be told when she’s just waking up from anaesthesia, that one of her kidneys has been unnecessarily removed.” The case has now moved on with the Florida’s Department of Health filing an administrative complaint against Vazquez.He could face a range of penalties from losing his medical license to simply paying a fine. “Few medical errors are as vivid and terrying as those that involve patients who have undergone surgery on the wrong body part,” according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.Such mistakes are deemed “never events”.  In fact, they say they do happen in around one out of every , surgical procedures. “The case was settled on his behalf for a nominal amount due to the uncertainty of litigation and in no way did Dr Vazquez admit liability by agreeing to this settlement,” Vazquez’s attorney Mark Mittelmark said in an email.Vazquez does not carry malpractice insurance, according to the Health Department. The malpractice insurers for her primary surgeons, Dr John Britt and Dr Jeffrey Kugler, settled for , apiece, according to the Department of Insurance Regulation. The paper said Vazquez made a “presumptive diagnosis” when he noticed what he thought was a malignant pelvic mass once he prepped the patient’s lower back for the back surgery, according to the Health Department’s complaint. He clipped it and removed what he thought was a tumor, but a month later a pathologist at Wellington Regional confirmed the mass removed was, in fact, an intact pelvic kidney.

Marie Mango takes little Bella wherever she goes - and even strangers mistake the -month-old for a real toddler. But the -year-old has endured years of heartache and depression after being told she would never have a baby of her own.Marie always dreamt of becoming a parent and while other children at school wanted to be dancers or vets, she knew that being a mum was her true calling. Even as a teen she became the neighbourhood babysitter, which she loved, thinking it would be great practice for when she had children of her own. But her world came crashing down when she turned .  Doctors told her she would never be able to have children due to being diagnosed with Turner syndrome, which causes infertility.The devastating news caused Marie, from Bonner Springs, Kansas, USA, to spiral into depression as she desperately tried to find something to fill the black hole. As well as this, Marie was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in  that has slowed her down and made her feel incapable of being able to adopt. She said: My friends are very supportive, as for my family they just say to do what makes me happy. I think when people have had children pretty easily, its harder for them to understand but I do have one amazing friend who has three children herself and is very supportive.  It was in  that Marie discovered reborns on YouTube and she got Bella in August.She now role-plays with her reborn doll asshe is actually her daughter to fill the void left by her heartache. And Bella has helped Marie capture happiness in her le asshe were a real child. But Marie stressed that she doesnt fill the void completely but shes looking forward to welcoming her next reborn, Liam, in December. She said: Im still depressed but trying to capture any happiness with my reborn doll. I should put a disclaimer that no reborn regardless how realistic will ever fill that void of a real child, but it does help. Ive been dealing with depression since I was  years old when I found out I couldnt have children. It came as a shock to me since pretty much everyone in my family can have children and had no back up plan. I grew up wanting to be a mother, most other kids wanted to be ballerinas or vets but I had a strong desire to be a mother one day. Marie also admitted: My world crashed when I was told that I couldnt have kids. In a lot of ways it was a blessing at that very moment because I was in a very bad relationship.  I had a big void and was trying anything to fill it, but it was like an infinite black hole and thats when I came across reborns. My reborn toddler Bella isnt ultra-realistic, but she fools people a lot. I took her to festival and at a glance she looks real, its when youre really focusing on her that she gets busted, no toddler is this calm and never blinks. I love being a reborn mum at events, its nice getting the feeling of others interacting with her and it allows me to just get a glimpse of what its like to be a real mum. Marie shares her adventures with Bella on her Instagram and YouTube pages and with friends, family and loving partner, Andy, are all supportive of her hobby.  She has also spoken out against people who might criticise her.She said: Haters dont grab my attention at all, I block and delete their comments. I think its really horrible to judge someone for having a doll, theyre not hurting anyone or forcing it upon anyone . Why judge someone for having a doll  Its not that weird. Think before you judge, people are so quick to judge and assume. Let them feel like they are accepted by society instead of making them feel nervous about bringing their dolls out in public because of how outsiders make them feel.

Allyson MacIvor was watching the show at Rogers Place, an arena in Edmonton, when she was caught up in the moment while listening to her favourite song. Although not in a relationship with her pal, the two women were caught up in the moment and kissed - but their innocent actions drew the attention of an usher who came towards them waving her finger disapprovingly and placed her hand between them, Allyson claims. MacIvor shared her shock over the incident on Facebook, where it has been shared hundreds of times.  Telling her friends she was raising a toast with her coffee cup, she wrote: Last night was a reminder, as I came home speechless, disturbed, and sad from the Jack White concert I was attending at Rogers Place. During the final encore, one of my favouritessongs of all time, I grabbed my friend, and kissed her...a fun moment on a beautul night. We were immediately interrupted by a young Rogers Place worker, who pulled me to the side, away from my seat, waving her finger disapprovingly, saying “that’s not allowed here.” I looked at her with the most shocked, dumbfounded look, and claried, “You mean kiss her  Im not allowed to kiss her here  Is that what you mean ”, where she again said, “Yes, andyou have a problem with that you can speak to my manager.”  When the song had finished, MacIvor and her friend put on their coats and the young worker marched them towards her managers office - asthey were being taken to a school headteacher, she says. MacIvor recalled the worker telling her manager: They were kissing at their seats during the encore, which is inappropriate sexual behaviour.” She continued: The manager, taking the reignsasked her to resume her post, as the young worker walked away, glaring in disapproval at my friend and I. The arena staff were very apologetic, as I wrote an incident report, with tears in my eyes, realizing we still live in a world where I have to watch my back as a “gay” woman, and apparently, I still have to watch whom I kiss, even at Rogers Place. So today, I’m making a toast to our children, and the next generation. I hope their love, no matter how it looks, is never interrupted.  A spokesperson for Oilers Entertainment Group said: We have an absolute zero tolerance for any form of discrimination, CBC reports. MacIvor also received an apology from Steinunn Parsons, assistant general manager of guest experience at Rogers Place arena. Parsons offered her and her friend complimentary concert tickets and a dinner of their choice to make up for the negative experience.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

In general, Irish referees tend to let more go and there may be more of a tendency to get away with hands on the back and perhaps more pulling and shoving.#We’ll just need to be careful and concentrate on our game.

All of this will provide an improved dental service by increasing patient access and choice.#We would also like to reassure patients that Scottish Government regulations ensure that the dentist in the new practice will be obliged to provide  per cent of the dental treatment under the NHS, so any private work would be limited.#"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays scott between the sticks for scotland","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowInveraray Shinty Club#s young goalkeeper Scott MacLachlan will represent Scotland in an under- international versus Ireland.Scotland manager Alan MacRae has selected his team to play the Irish in a shinty hurling cross-codes match on Saturday November , and Scott MacLachlan will feature between the sticks.Other Argyll players in the squad are Oban Camanachd#s Daniel Sloss and Ross MacMillan of Oban Celtic # both of whom will feature from the bench.Scotland will be captained by Blair Morrison from Caberfeidh.The annual Marine Harvest under- shinty hurling international will take place at the GAA’s National Games Development Centre at Abbotstown, Dublin with a pm throw in.The game will be refereed by Archie Ritchie."},{"url":null,"title":"life beyond mojo stephen skinn","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowFollowing the recent outstanding MOJO festival of original music in Ardfern, the Argyllshire Advertiser takes a look at what the leading musical lights of Argyll are up to following their rockin# display at MOJOStephen Skinn from Loch Awe village first joined the live music world in  with some of his own songs performed in the Corran Halls, Oban, to a large and enthusiastic audience.He has continued writing and recording to produce his first album #Living Off Dreams#, influenced by artists including The Faces, Oasis and Bruce Springsteen.The album encompasses music styles from folk, pop to alternative rock where Stephen#s cool, inviting vocals always leave you feeling upbeat.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13549120.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS134733004.jpg","title":"ayrs station hotel cannot afford","story":"NewsAyrs Station Hotel cannot afford more delay, says MSP Brian WhittleOfficials have been urged to make a quick decision on the future of the Station Hotel, with some trains now running south of the town againShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsStation Hotel \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA decision on the future of Ayr’s Station Hotel must not be kicked down the road, insists an MSP. Brian Whittle says officials must act with more urgency than ever following the resumption of services south of the town. The surprise call to send trains back on the route to Stranraer was made by ScotRail bosses on Thursday. Their decision followed a morning test run on the track beneath the crumbling hotel. But South of Scotland member, Mr Whittle, warned: “Just because the trains are running again, no-one should feel we can put off making a decision about the Station Hotel’s future. “A general unwillingness by South Ayrshire Council and others to think about the future of the building were what got us into this mess and I’m not prepared to see action put off again. “The Station Hotel can’t be allowed to sit abandoned for a minute more than is necessary to make the decision. “People who rely on the railway can’t afford any more dithering and delay.”  Work to stabilise the B-Listed structure continues this week with a scaffolding being erected. One source close to the works said: “The roof is a big problem and is nowhere near being tackled yet. “It remains to be seen what the structural engineers will want to do but saving it is a very big job.” Limited services are now running to Stranraer for the first time since council chiefs threw up an exclusion zone in August. Buses will continue to operate for the services that haven’t been reintroduced, and for services between Ayr and Girvan. The existing timetable for services between Ayr and Glasgow Central remains in place. Alex Hynes, ScotRail Alliance managing director, said: “We know it has been a challenging time for our customers, so we are pleased to be able to restore some services between Ayr and Stranraer. “We are working flat out with South Ayrshire Council and our task force partners to get all services to and from Ayr back to normal as soon as possible.” Bill Reeve, chair of Ayr Station Task Force, added: “Theof rail passenger services between Stranraer and Ayr is a welcome step towards resolving this issue. “While we remain mindful there is still work to be done to restore the complete service it is good that hard work by both South Ayrshire Council and the ScotRail Alliance has now made this first step possible. “The Task Force partners continue to work together to ensure we can bring back a full timetable as quickly as possible and we thank businesses, commuters and the local community for their continued patience while we do.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScotrailSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13548879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166431538.jpg","title":"beith juniors president says club","story":"NewsBeith Juniors president says club are ready for Scottish Cup day with Ayr UnitedThe Mighty president, John Boal, says Ayrs large travelling support will be given a warm welcome at Bellsdale Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsBeith president John Boal\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBosses at Beith Juniors today insisted they are ready and able to host Ayr United in the Scottish Cup.

The plea comes as the John Pollock Centre, which has been described as “unfit for purpose”, is facing an uncertain future. And it is feared that the Mainholm Road facility may only have a year left before it is closed. The issue was raised at this month’s North Ayr Community Council that was attended by councillors Ian Cavana and Ian Davis and senior council officer Mark Baker. Robert Green, secretary of the community, insisted there was a desperate need for a community hub in the north of Ayr. And he asked: “Can councillors tell me about the John Pollock Centre being bulldozed ” Tory councillor Ian Davis replied: “I don’t think there is much we can say.” Mr Green added: “How can you guide the community council to get funds for a community hub  “It could be on similar lines as the new one in Maybole.” Mr Baker said a few community groups in the area had been raising the same issue. He revealed that there were a few options to consider but the council would need to engage with the community first. “We need to find out what spaces and places are available and what is required,” he added. “We need to get groups together to find what the solution is.” Mr Green said his preferred option would be to build a new facility in the existing grounds of the John Pollock Centre and that would be an ideal location for people living in Lochside, Dalmilling, Whitletts and Craigie. Labour councillor Ian Cavana said the John Pollock Centre was given a “state of execution” after council’s plans for moving local authority workers into the proposed controversial Riverside development was axed in the summer. “This time next year the John Pollock Centre would really be under pressure,” he declared. “I would love to see a new complex built to the right of the existing John Pollock Centre.” The community council heard that the John Pollock Centre is a well-used community facility for groups including line dancing, netball, keep fit, bingo and other activities. Councillor Cavana added: “It is the hub of the community. But it needs a new build. There is no definite plan just now but time is ticking. “The building is not fit for modern days.” Mr Green asked for the council’s help to access funds to build a new community hub.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyAyrSouth Ayrshire Council"},{"url":null,"title":"council chiefs apologise after sports","story":"NewsCouncil chiefs apologise after sports facility was dug up without warningResidents in Murkirk were left frustrated and helpless as their only sports facility was taken away due to wear and tear.ShareByPippa Smith:,  NOV News \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil chiefs have apologised after AstroTurf was dug up without warning.

He said: “Muirkirk articial AstroTurf was ripped up supposedly in the name of health and safety. “This is wrong, the park was in excellent condition. “It was that good, the mothers would meet up during the day with their young children in the park, shut gate and let them play knowing they were safe and there was nothing on the playing surface. It is well looked after by all its users. “After that primary school children would play football, then secondary kids would play football. After that, the adults would play. Why were no signs put up of this supposed damage  “Why was no one told – like Muirkirk Community Council – or a notice of any sort put up about damage and it being ripped up ” Another resident added: “This has caused outrage amongst kids, teenagers and adults alike. “In fact, a large section of our village are extremely upset. “The pitch, despite being free to use at any time following the closure of the games hall, was always well cared for by those who used it. “Anybody walking past the pitch will tell you that there was no evidence that the pitch or surrounding grounds were abused in anyway. “The village feel frustrated and helpless as our council come along and just seem to do whatever they want.” Bob McCulloch, acting head of housing and communities at East Ayrshire Council, said he e appreciated the disappointment of the community regarding the removal of the AstroTurf in Muirkirk. “The work was undertaken due to safety issues and the wear and tear of the pitch,” he added. “The council acknowledges that the community should have been informed of what was taking place and the reasons for this. “We apologise that this did not happen. “Council officers will be meeting with the community council and others shortly to explore the replacement options and we are committed to working with the community to find the best solution to enable local needs to be met.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13489965.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18066403.jpg","title":"partick thistle 0 ayr united","story":"NewsPartick Thistle , Ayr United  - Three things we learned at FirhillA Michael Rose header secured all three points for United in Glasgow as Ian McCalls men kept up their remarkable title challenge.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsMichael Roses header crosses the line to hand Ayr victory \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr Uniteds title bandwaggon kept on rolling in Glasgow as Michael Roses second half header earned a deserved three points for the visitors.

Whistler Bobby sends Ayr raving Madden - AGAIN It would be fair to say Ayr boss Ian McCall and ref Bobby Madden arent the greatest of pals. McCall made his feelings on the whistler well known after Ayrs trip to Ibrox earlier this season - and United were on the end of a string of hotly disputed calls here. Madden waved away two first half penalty shouts and angered Ayr with a number of other baffling calls which threatened to send the game past boiling point in the second half.  McCall wins battle of the bosses On a day when all eyes were on the Thistle dugout and Gary Caldwell making his home debut, Ian McCall made yet another triumphantto his old stomping ground. Ayrs wily gaffer made two big calls in starting Craig Moore and Declan McDaid and his men responded in style with another fine performance. McCall is not afraid of the big decisions and appears to be juggling his squad to perfection at the moment, as proven by this display where his team selection and tactics proved spot on.

the era of swing and the year of Benny Goodmanrsquos Tattletale.Anne on piano and Dick on clarinet played this with great gusto and we were informed afterwards that for a man who was known for such up beat music he was rather a grumpy inidual.The pace slowed a little for Scott Joplinrsquos The Entertainer.ldquoFor rag is never to be played fast, according to the man himself.This music composed in  was later discovered by the director of the Sting who heard it being played by his son one day, a film that won an Oscar for its musical song score.Music by Claude Debussy followed-a sandwich of Le Petit Negre Syrinx Gollywogs cakewalk.Syrinx was very atmospheric-the lights went out and Annersquos flute could be heard imitating the Greek God Pan playing the reeds from Greek Mythology.The versatile Anne played Rosemary by Frank Bridge on piano next-quite beautully-this surely must have been a piece about the love of his le.Dick then brought out the bass clarinet and introduced his own compositions - Pontefiore and Tarantella.Pontefiore was composed for a stage production set in the South of Italy in which a Private Angelo finds a little peace amongst the conflict of war.Tarantella is a   time dance which victims dance when bitten by a tarantula!Then it was time for the interval and for Anne and Dick to enjoy a well earned brew.After the tea break the audience were introduced to the saxophone and it was explained that it was invented by Adolf Sax and fully intended to be a very loud marching band instrument.Peqena Czarda by Pedro Iturralde showcased the saxophone wonderfully with its hints of Spanish Tango. Lover Man - a sultry nocturne followed made famous by pianist and composer Ram Ramirez.Then it was time for another of Dicks own compositions on the bass clarinet.In Blues for Jimmy the scene was set in the deep South of America from around  with the deep tones of the bass clarinet echoing the African American blues.A tongue in cheek Stranger on the Shore came next complete with seagulls.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

authorities across the country had seen spending on maintaining their roads cut by  per cent since .Iain Gray, East Lothian MSP, said the latest report which revealed the state of the countyrsquos network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

It does not imply that a deal has been done.The development will do little to dampen speculation among Tory Eurosceptics that a deal is close to being signed off.Brusselsrsquo chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said ldquomore work is needed but ldquowe remain determined to reach a deal.Mrs Mayrsquos plan would see the whole UK effectively agree to remain in the customs union to help avoid a hard border with Ireland as a ldquobackstopno other arrangement can be found.The concerns focus on Mr Coxrsquos advice on how an exit from the backstop could be found to make sure the UK is not permanently kept within a customs union which would severely curtail its ability to strike free trade deals with nations around the world ndash a key prize for Brexiteers.Legal advice is usually confidential, but DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme thatthe House of Commons was going to have a meaningful vote on the deal ldquothen I think people are entitled to know what that advice is.Sir Keir, who visited Brussels for talks with senior EU figures, said: ldquoAt this crucial stage, Parliament should not be kept in the dark nor should the Government try to bounce MPs into an agreement without all the facts.After a marathon session on Tuesday, the Cabinetis on stand-by for fresh talks to agree a Brexit dealthere are further developments.Mrs May updated European Council president Donald Tusk on the situation on Wednesday morning.Phone call with PM @theresa_may this morning to take stock of progress in #brexit talks and discuss way ahead.mdash Donald TuskNovember , He said the call was a chance to ldquotake stock of progress and discuss the way ahead.Mrs May told senior ministers on Tuesdayshe would not agree a withdrawal deal with the EU ldquoat any cost.The PM assured her top team that there would be another Cabinet before any agreement is settled.No extra meeting has been scheduled ahead of the regular weekly gathering next Tuesday.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, speaking at a tech sector event, said there are ldquostill some stumbling blocks in relation to Northern Ireland as he touched on the withdrawal agreement.On immigration, Mr Raab backed moving from a system which is ldquooverly focused on free movement from the EU to being ldquoopen to getting the very best talent here from right across the world.After referring to a recent Migration Advisory Committee report, Mr Raab went on: ldquoIt also interestingly I think for the tech sector, because yoursquove got a younger generation of workers coming through, also makes some interesting analysis about the value to the UK economy of younger workers coming from abroad ndash both in terms of productivity but also net contribution to the UK.ldquoThatrsquos kind of interesting analysis in terms of I think the UK but also the wider approach to immigration, so thatrsquos something I know Home Secretary Sajid Javid is looking at very carefully.Mr Raab later said he wants a ldquopro-consumer Brexit which eases the cost of living by cutting prices in UK stores, adding the white paper on immigration will emerge ldquoreasonably soon."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/9008020.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"uk-extradites-fugitive-tycoon-to-croatia","story":"A year after Todoric was detained in London on embezzlement charges, the -year-old landed in Zagreb on a commercial flight from London and was escorted by police to a prison in the Croatian capital.Todoric is accused in Croatia of mismanaging the Agrokor company and embezzling millions.

There may be a glut in the global market for Michelinrsquos small car tyres, and diesel and petrol cars are being phased out. But we are not going to see the end of transportation, which is the basis of civilisation itself. Whatever you look at ndash electric, hydrogen, compressed air ndash the vehicles of the future are going to need tyres.And increasingly they are likely to require small, high-quality tyres, with low rolling resistance, of the kind Michelin was supposed to specialise in making in Dundee. The current vogue for ever-larger cars, with bigger wheels, which we are told has killed demand for the plantrsquos tyres, cannot last. Heavy diesel SUVs will be so expensive to run in five or ten yearsrsquo time that no one in their right minds will buy them. It is anyway one of the daftest fashions of modern times.But surely, making car tyres is a noxious chemical process that pollutes the environment and leaves a massive carbon footprint  Well, not in Dundee it doesnrsquot, where much of Michelinrsquos power comes from two wind turbines. Sixty-one million pounds ndash much of it public money ndash has been spent on making this plant one of the most advanced and least polluting on the planet. The more you look at the closure of Michelin Dundee, the less it seems to make sense. This is not some rust belt relic.The Michelin plant used to provide secure employment for nearly , workers, and many more in the companies that depended on their wages. It contributed at least pound million to the local economy ndash four times the best estimate of the VArsquos impact. These were secure, well-paid jobs, not disposable seasonal tourist work. You can well understand the anger of the workforce here, which has worked closely with the French firm since it came here in .Indeed, one of the reasons Michelinrsquos closure came as such as surprise is that it has been, in many ways, a model of modern, constructive industrial relations and rarely in the news ndash unlike plants like Timex, which closed after a bitter strike in . The Michelin union leaders are talking about ldquobetrayal by the company, not least because the news was leaked to the press before the workforce got to hear of it, and before Christmas too. Why, they ask, has this happened only three years after the Dundee plant was reconfigured precisely so that it could make a larger range of bigger tyres Well, the biggest and most obvious change is Brexit. That has been the black swan event that no one in large-scale manufacturing in the UK considered a possibility until . And only very recently has the prospect of a no-deal Brexit become a reality. This is a French firm, after all, and you might expect it to be worried about the prospect of .m tyres having special export certicates and tarfs when they cross new borders to the European single market.However, the company insists that its decision to close Dundee has nothing to do with Britainrsquos decision to leave the European Union. There is no particular reason to disbelieve it. Indeed, it might well have suited the pro-European French President, Emanuel Macron, to declare that Brexit is such a disaster on wheels that even tyre manufacturers are fleeing the UK.So, wersquore left with the firmrsquos main claim that cheap tyres from Asia are being dumped here, and making even modern car tyre manufacturing uneconomic. That has nothing directly to do with Brexit, but it does relate to it. It underlines the kind of economic environment into which Britain is headed, post-Brexit. Increasingly, workers in the UK will be competing with workers in developing countries where wages are often nugatory.The ldquoGlobal Britain project is all about thrusting Britain into this low-cost, low-regulation market, a kind of Hong Kong of Europe, where we produce cheap goods to flood the EU. At least thatrsquos the theory of the Tory Brexiters. A more likely scenario is cheap goods, like tyres, flooding into Britain destroying what is left of our manufacturing base. Britain may be a post-industrial economy, but that doesnrsquot mean that making things is unimportant. Brexit is isolating the UK from EU supply chains and hastening deindustrialisation.Should the Scottish Government intervene  Well, its powers are extremely limited, not least by EU regulations on supporting loss-making industries. A lot of public money, around poundm, has already gone into the plant. It doesnrsquot seem plausible that it could be nationalised, because it is an integral part of a global company, the second-largest tyre manufacturer on the planet, and would lack the global retail networks to sell the tyres evenit could make them cheaply enough.Some might suspect that Michelin had known all along that its plant was doomed and was just using what public money it could access to run the plant down while extracting what profits it could. But that would be ungenerous. Michelin has a reputation for being a relatively responsible company, and anyway it invested a great deal of its own cash in the Dundee plant. Unfortunately, it was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.But these are not jobs that Britain can lose with equanimity. The intellectual capital being built in Dundeersquos universities and the games sector GTA may provide twice as many jobs as Michelin, according to TIGA, which represents the digital publishing and video games industry. But these jobs can go as fast as they arrive. Scotland needs an industrial policy that doesnrsquot depend on the vagaries of the market. And the sudden collapse of the UK tyre industry is a signal reminder of what le would be like outside the European Union."},{"url":null,"title":"a-15m-funding-scheme-for-edinburghs-festivals","story":"The new scheme, involving the capitalrsquos council, Edinburgh Festivals and the Scottish Government, is called PLACE, or Platforms for Creative Excellence.The first section o f funding, worth pound.m will be for the first three years, and decisions for another pound.m will be made in  .This package will include poundm from the participating festivals themselves, to create the overall poundm sum.The money, the festivals said, will be used for ldquonew commissions, global and European premieres, multi-year national and international programming partnerships and onward tours of work.One will be a ldquoprogramme bringing Scottish and international writers together to explore hotspots in world politics and share inside stories of their journeys with audiences.The Edinburgh International Festival will receive pound.m, and the Fringe, pound, while the cityrsquos book festival will receive pound, in funds for a series of projects.One of the Edinburgh International Book Festival projects will be Citizen, a three-year residency programme, \"empowering communities across Edinburgh to engage in democratic discourse and build a relationship with the August Festival\".The EIF funding will be used to increase its community engagement, among other plans.Each partner has made an \"annual in-principle commitment of poundm\" for the duration of the programme, and the programme will run for a period of five years.City of Edinburgh Council Leader Adam McVey, said: ldquoBorne out of our productive City Region Deal discussions with the Scottish Government, this joint funding package is a commitment to protect the legacy and support the future of our festivals.\"Between them, the festivals attract audiences of over .m and are vital to our cityrsquos success and reputation, adding poundm to the Scottish economy every year.\"It is a huge milestone to announce this first phase of investment.\"The funding will support some really pioneering projects, ones which without our joint support could not take place.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9002159.jpg?type=article-full","title":"us-midterms-record-number-of-women-heading-to-congress-as-democrats-win-back-house","story":"Voters are on track to send at least  women to the house, surpassing the previous record of .According to data compiled by The Associated Press,  women ran for the house as major-party candidates this year.Read more:Democrats take House but Trumps grip on Senate tightensAmong the new representatives headed to the house is Jenner Wexton, a Virginia state senator who defeated incumbent Barbara Comstock in one of the most closely-watched races across the country.And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the former Bernie Sanders organiser who won a shock primary victory over a senior house Democrat, will also head to congress.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez The election day gains by women capped a midterm election which has been defined by the energy of women, both on the political left and right.Female candidates not only ran for office at an unprecedented rate, with several defeating white, male incumbents during their party primaries, they mobilised on the grassroots level, and played larger roles as donors than in previous election cycles.In victory speeches across the country, women acknowledged it has been a ground-breaking year.Ayanna Pressley, who became the first black woman elected to US congress from Massachusetts, said: \"I am so honoured to share both the ballot and the stage with the many visionary, bold women who have raised their hand to run for public office.\"Now, listen, I know for a fact none of us ran to make history - we ran to make change.

Itrsquos long overdue in that sense.ldquoThis resort has been around since the s and itrsquos about time money was spent on it, to sort it out.It comes after The Herald on Sunday highlighted ongoing concerns over the future of Cairngormrsquos ski slopes and the small Speyside town of Aviemore, nestled nearby.Once the jewel in the crown of Scottish snowsports, local businesses and residents have recently voiced concerns following a slump in visitor numbers.This has been exacerbated by technical problems with the mountainrsquos funicular railway, which mean it is widely expected to be out of action this winter.In a bid to turn the resortrsquos fortunes around, Highlands and Islands Enterprisecommissioned US consultancy, SE Group, to carry out an independent review. HIE owns Cairngorm mountain and the troubled funicular railway, having taken over from its predecessor body, the Highlands and Islands Development Board.SE Group highlighted ldquoimmense unlocked potential at Cairngorm that can be unleashed with targeted, strategic investments, and has now recommended a number of proposals to increase annual winter visitor numbers to ,.But some are already anticipating pushback from environmental groups.In the s, plans for the mountainrsquos funicular ended up in court after strong opposition from WWF and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.Kenna Chisholm, regional conservation manager for RSPB Scotland, said: ldquoCairnGorm Mountain is located within a very special natural environment, much of which is legally protected for its rare and vulnerable wildle and habitats.ldquoThese include the iconic and highly threatened capercaillie in the surrounding woodlands, and dotterel and montane plants on the fragile Cairngorm plateau.ldquoIt is crucial that new development and increased recreation at Cairngorm mountain is not at the expense of this special natural environment, which is recognised by the report as a particular selling point for visitors.ldquoSome of the developments and infrastructure recommended in the report are very substantial with signicant implications for the environment, which will need to be very carefully considered.SE Grouprsquos study involved an analysis of current operations at Cairngorm, as well as the market context and consultation with local businesses and public bodies.It argued the sitersquos funicular, which carries large volumes of winter visitors every year, was ldquounique to Cairngorm and recommended it continued to be improved.But after the new chairlts are constructed, it should be tailored towards ldquonon-skiing visitors and ski school customers.Charlotte Wright, chief executive of HIE, said the study was ldquoan excellent piece of work that presents a long-term vision for Cairngorm, which will be used to prioritise future investment.She said: ldquoClearly poundm, even over ten years, is a large investment for a single resort, and funding is often the most challenging of all obstacles. However, the report certainly gives us all something to work towards.ldquoWe are determined that the vision for Cairngorm is a joint vision and that work towards achieving that vision is carried out jointly. To that end, an important aspect to all of this will be engagement with local business and community groups, politicians, public bodies and other stakeholders."},{"url":null,"title":"anm group s charity calendar now on sale","story":"Scotland#s leading farming co-operative, ANM Group, has announced that its  charity calendar is now on sale.The calendar has been created following a four-month social media photo competition.The competition received more than  entries.The winning images were taken by members, customers and farming enthusiasts from the north east and showcase the best of Scotland’s agricultural industry.Sales of the calendar will be donated to Northsound Cash for Kids and the Royal Northern Countryside Initiative.Grant Rogerson, ANM Group Chief Executive, said: “Our sincere thanks and appreciation to all members and customers for participating in ANM’s social media photo competition.“All proceeds from the sale will go directly to two great local charities, selected by our charity committee.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amAlistair Carmichael, MP for Orkney and Shetland, has called on Treasury Ministers to work across Government to help invest in the wave and tidal industry to push it to the point of full commercialisation.

It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Will the Chief Secretary work with the Secretary of State for Business to develop that proposal and work with the Business Department and the developers to see the fruition of what could be a very important part of the Government’s industrial strategy.”Responding to Mr Carmichael, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt. Hon. Liz Truss MP, said: “As part of the spending review we will be looking at the most efficient way we can achieve our carbon targets, and I am working closely with the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to do.”Commenting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The Minister’s response will do little to assure the industry that they are a priority for the Government. There was nothing in the Budget for this industry, and the Government have been working closely across departments for some time now. It is disappointing that little progress appears to be being made.“Wave and tidal power generation and new and innovative forms of producing green energy. The ambition of the industry however has not been matched by the policy framework, which continues to prevent this sector from reaching the point where it becomes commercially viable.“Renewable energy generation, particularly wave and tidal stream power are areas at which the Northern Isles is at the very forefront, and the creation of these Innovative Power Purchase Agreements would make great strides towards helping these innovative industries continue to flourish.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach. It’s a particularly impressive atmosphere when the tide is high and the weather rough.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are hopeful however that the Scottish Government will pass on the additional money.\"Over the period   to   the Highland Council has already had to implement budget savings of pound. million and council tax rises of % in each of the last two years in order to deliver a balanced budget.

She said: \"Our children are subject to appalling conditions. Only today my daughter had to sit in her classroom with her coat and hat on as it was so cold. A classroom that incorporates the staff toilet and staff room. To avoid the staff room, children are having to go in and out of the classroom via outdoors.\"Dingwall and Seaforth ward councillor Angela MacLean invited childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd and the arearsquos MSP, Kate Forbes, to support a push for funding for a replacement. Ms MacLean said: \"I think the staff do a fantastic job and it is incumbent on us to try and get a solution and all work together. Having it on the capital programme with a reduced capital budget has been dficult but everyone who has seen it knows it is badly needing replaced. Whether it be Scottish Government or Highland Council we all have to work together. Given the children that go to St Clementrsquos, it does make it more urgent because they are our most vulnerable young people.\"Mrs Todd, a Ross-shire-based Highlands and Islands MSP, declared the school not fit for purpose when she visited this year.She said shersquod be \"more than happy\" to meet local councillors but added: \"As a member of the ruling administration, Ms MacLean will know that St Clementrsquos had not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans.\"Since my visit to St Clementrsquos this year Highland Council has now prioritised it. Should they require my support in making further progress, I am happy to help.\"Dingwall-based MSP Kate Forbes previously described the school \"as like something out of Oliver Twist\".She said: \"Highland Councilrsquos plans for school buildings seem to be entirely reliant on additional Scottish Government funding when it is the council who has statutory responsibility for school buildings and their annual budget settlement recognises that.\"Shesaid Highland Council had been the second highest beneficiary of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Schools for the Future funding scheme, receiving poundmillion. The next school buildings funding programme is expected by the end of the year.Renewing an appeal for progress, Ms Ferguson warned of \"promises broken and deadlines long passed\" and accused the council of breaking the law over conditions.

We should have something similar around the Firth. You see people driving past Kirkmichael slowing down to take a look because it looks interesting. People are drawn in and genuinely interested by what they see.\"Irsquom not really all that comfortable with heritage being competitive but this does mean the community, which has been supporting this for close on  years, can be recognised. Five years ago we were at the point of giving up when the roof literally fell in. We had a meeting with the community and they urged us to push on.\"The Federation of Small Businessesrsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, David Richardson, hailed the Trust for \"working wonders\" on the kirk, graveyards and mediaeval stones.\"Visiting old graveyards is not just of interest to locals and those with ancestors buried in them it is also very popular with many visitors interested in soaking up more of the local atmosphere and history and in reading the stories written on the older the stones.\"Including interpretive  that explain more of the history and expand on these stories makes the whole experience even more powerful.\"Dr Mackayrsquos suggestion that a Highland graveyard heritage trail should be created is excellent surely an idea whose time has come  Itrsquos certainly well worth further exploration and discussion.\"Kate Forbes MSP, whose constituency takes in the Black Isle, said: \"I love what the Kirkmichael Trust has done to repair the graveyard and draw in locals and visitors. As somebody who loves history, I think itrsquos brilliant they have brought the past to le in such a way that tourists choose to come.\"We have a rich heritage on the Black Isle, that is slowly being forgotten. From the church services at the natural amphitheatre at Ferintosh Burn to Hugh Millerrsquos hometown of Cromarty, there are stories galore. Now Kirkmichael Trust has put this on the map.\"A spokeswoman for the Port of Cromarty Firth in Invergordon, said: \"Wersquore delighted the work of Kirkmichaelrsquos volunteers has been recognised with an Angel Award. Itrsquos a project the Port supported through our community sponsorship fund and we know the local community put a lot of effort into revitalising the site.Wednesday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We have a whole plan of engagement throughout the year that will do that, starting later this week.\"And at the same time to listen to the public and to hear the views of what the council is doing really well, what everyone believes the council could be doing better in terms of delivering services and the important part of that is that we go across the Highlands to hear those views.\"The first thing is about listening to people, the second most important thing is about going back and saying to people lsquoyou said and we willrsquo or lsquowe are not able to becausersquo.\"The councilis due tostart a \"public budget engagement process\" tomorrow, designed to help the local authority make decisions to balance its books.\"It is really important that we listen throughout the month of November,\" Mrs Manson said. \"Then we will go back and give feedback on what the suggestions are.\"Mrs Manson was upbeat about the local authorityrsquos financial woes that have seen it stumble from one unpopular cutback to another over several months amid a flurry of resignation threats from within the administration.\"I am quite positive about our budget situation here in the Highlands ndash I think we are in a fair place,\" she said. \"There are places where we will be able to make efficiencies and our officer team and our members are working on that all the time, day-in, day-out behind the scenes.\"However, Mrs Manson did accept that \"there are some challenging areas in there, such as what our priorities for resource and for spend are, and I think it is very important to take a transparent approach so that when we do take decisions in February [when the council budget is decided] we can actually evidence it comes after listening to people.\"One of the answers to those challenges, according to the chief executive, is to rely on the \"many talented staff who believe in the values of public service and that we are here to make a dference\" and to capitalise on an upsurge in community involvement.\"I genuinely believe that many, many people that I have been speaking to over the last few months in dferent parts of the Highlands have really good ideas,\" she said. \"They see where the council can become more efficient.\"But equally so, I think that people can be more understanding of the challenges that we face.\"The local authority has made pound. million of savings since  and raised council tax by three per cent in each of the last two years.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \"We have to do more with less money and our costs are rising for things like fuel, pay and cost of living.\"We are working with services to produce comprehensive information on our current spending profiles, to identy where there are opportunities for efficiencies and any commercial opportunities. Our focus will be on directing our resources to those areas which will give us the best outcomes and deliver value for money.\"Depute budget leader Matthew Reiss said: \"It will not be easy to find more savings on top of those we have already made. Income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies become even more vital in this context in order to protect essential services and we do not have the luxury of the signicant reserves we once had to give us any room for manoeuvre.\"It is undoubtedly the case that there will be very hard decisions to make and we will begin a process of engagement to help us make the right decisions and do the best we can.\"Wednesday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If you live in the east of Scotland, it is the obvious place to go in order to fly to all sorts of destinations. In fact,you want to fly, you have to go to an airport – an observation so obvious that it hardly needs to be made. But it is worth bearing in mind when considering the responsibilities that the people who run airports have. They have a captive market, and they have to act accordingly.Edinburgh Airport has been consistently criticised for its astonishingly expensive parking charges. Obviously the airport has to weigh considerations of encouraging the use of public transport, which is environmentally so much better, against the desire of people to use their cars. If parking were to be prohibitively expensive, then people would be forced to use buses and trams. Butyou do allow it, which they do, then it should only be charged at a rate that is considered fair and not exorbitant. Otherwise it looks like taking advantage. And we might remind ourselves here that the idend paid to the owners of Edinburgh Airport this year was considerably higher than the previous year. Edinburgh Airport, in other words, makes lots and lots of money.But with that, it has a responsibility to avoid antagonising its users too much. It can antagonise them a bit, but not too much. It should not make them wait for ages and ages in a taxi queue – which seems to happen frequently – and it should also listen to the concerns of Edinburgh’s splendid, long-suffering taxi drivers. They, as a body, seem to have their issues, and they, as a body, are always right. Taxi drivers rarely present a finely nuanced view of the world as they see it.: Letters: Greedy Edinburgh Airport drop-off price hike is outrageousBut we should not spend too much time criticising the equally splendid body of people who run Edinburgh Airport. This is a well-managed airport and they obviously run it very efficiently, evenpeople tend to moan a little bit . It is not easy to run an airport, particularly when the airport has also become a large shopping centre, or, more accurately, an eastern souk. It is quite a business combining the job of running a grand souk and a place where people are able to catch a flight and find enough seats to sit down while they wait for their flight.One solution, of course, would be to charge people to sit down at the airport. This is not currently done, but I feel that it will not be long before that commercial opportunity is recognised and acted upon. These charges should be moderate – say, one pound for ten minutes, rising to five pounds payable by those who clearly have come to the airport with the intention of sitting around for a long time. These people should be discouraged from sitting on private seats and redirected to public benches outside. I have also noticed that the airport currently does not charge for the use of its toilets. This is something that must have escaped their notice and should be acted upon. Making the charge realistically high – say two pounds per visit – would discourage people from using the facilities, or even reading in the loo.: Edinburgh Airport passenger numbers break . million barrierBut lest this sounds like a series of complaints, I would like to make some positive suggestions for the airport, in its undoubted wisdom, to consider. The first of these is for a fast track facility to allow passengers who do not wish to follow a deliberately winding and circuitous path through their fantoosh duty free shop. This would enable you to get from security to gate without being forced to endure the efforts of salespeople to get one to sample whisky, buy sunglasses, or try perfumes. People can tell when they are the victims of intense sales pressure, you know. And some people, mirabile dictu, like to walk straight, rather than wander through a shop.As far as drop-off charges are concerned, it is about time that the airport recognised public resentment over these and introduced a new, conciliatory system whereby those who drop people off from their car are not charged, as long as they don’t stop the car. This would mean that drivers could slow down while their passengers leaped out of the car, tossing their suitcases ahead of them. Wardens could be on hand to impose charges on those who did not maintain sufficient speed in that manoeuvre.And finally, in this constructive spirit, how about introducing an emotional baggage desk in the departure hall  Many of us travel with excessive emotional baggage, and it would be a great innovationwe could declare this at the airport before the flight. This would mean that you would drop off your physical baggage at check-in, and then move on to declare your emotional baggage to an understanding and sympathetic agent at another desk. Things like unresolved issues. Doubts. Unfulfilled desires. There’s so much to talk about at airports.Use of the emotional baggage counter could attract a small charge.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,\\nf_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201\\n/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4825485.1541531951!/image/image.jpg","title":"join the british army foreign nationals should read this first","story":"Foreign nationals being urged to join the UK armed forces might wish to askit is is worth it, writes Martyn McLaughlin.In many ways, the news that Britain’s armed forces are to signicantly step up their recruitment drive among Commonwealth nations feels like the quintessential Brexit story.It knits together the narratives of a country wrestling with its imperial past, while stumbling and blinking its way towards an uncertain future, one where new threats must be mitigated by old alliances. At its heart, lie perpetually confounding questions of Britishness and belonging.The Ministry of Defence announcement, signalling an end to the five-year residency requirement for Commonwealth citizens looking to join the armed services, almost read like a celebration. It hailed the military’s “long-held links” with the Commonwealth and noted how its people have “bravely served in a iety of roles”. This proud legacy, said Mark Lancaster, the armed forces minister, would be seized upon, bringing “key skills” and “dedicated service”. He added: “Their dferent perspectives will also help us to enhance our cultural understanding, giving us an operational advantage over our adversaries.”It is hard to decide which subtext is the most absurd, but let us begin with the notion that Britain’s armed services are bastions of ersity and inclusion. This is a force where women account for just one in every ten regular forces personnel, and until last month, were ineligible to apply for swaths of roles. It is a force where black, asian and minority ethnic representation sits at . per cent. No less laughable is the idea that new Commonwealth recruits will be a bonus to Britain’s military might. Be under no illusions, this measure is explicitly designed to plug a gap of , soldiers, sailors and air personnel – the largest such shortfall in eight years. In the form of the Commonwealth, the UK Government – which has shown no shame over how it betrayed the contribution of the Windrush generation, veterans among them – has found a way to insult a new cohort under the guise of offering a gilded opportunity. : UK armed forces to allow foreign nationals to joinIt is farcical that he service of these men and women is not deemed a sufficient sacrice to earn them automatic UK citizenship, but then, there has always been an awkward, conflicting duality to the identity of the ranks of Britain’s Commonwealth personnel. On the one hand, they enjoy the heroic status afforded to all those prepared to kill – and die – for the realm on the other, they remain ‘others’, a migrant force who serve with, but not in, our forces.The earliest ranks of Fijians and Jamaicans, unable to apply for UK citizenship even after serving for more than five years, learned the hard way. The reason given was a risible as it was cruel – time served in German and Cypriot outposts nulled continuous residency. It took until  before the Home Office changed the rules.Until , a child born to foreign nationals in the armed services during an overseas posting was not automatically eligible to become a UK citizen, an appalling oversight which meant the siblings in some families had dferent nationalities. It is easy to characterise these incidents as anomalies, but the history of our Commonwealth service personnel is one of institutionalised disadvantage. You hear it still in the idle, ignorant chatter of ‘foreign legions’ and ‘mercenaries’, but it is built into the system too.The cumulative impact of immigration issues, visas, travel and cultural dferences leaves many Commonwealth recruits feeling subordinate, asked to shoulder every risk infor few of the rewards.Studies into this Commonwealth military contingent are thin on the ground, but their findings are striking. A  London School of Economics report found they were often passed over for promotion or not drafted into roles they applied for due to racial prejudice and a lack of assimilation.: Almost , Scottish MoD jobs have goneIn March, meanwhile, Anglia Ruskin University researchers found that the most problematic issue facing the Commonwealth armed forces community was being able to remain in the UK because of costly visas and complex immigration rules. As one respondent put it, “all aspects of le unravel” when faced with the byzantine immigration system. The cost of settlement for an inidual service member from the Commonwealth is £,. Should they wish to bring a partner and two children, the sum spirals to an eyewatering £,. Indeed, figures from the Army Families Federation show visa costs increased by  per cent between  and , whilst the cost of family members remaining permanently in the UK rose by  per cent for adults and an astonishing , per cent for children over the same period.As things stand, a Commonwealth Army private on basic pay does not meet the minimum immigration income threshold of £, to bring a spouse and child to the UK.Quite how the UK Government can allow this to continue, while hoping to recruit an additional , people from the Commonwealth each year, speaks either to its ignorance or its disdain. Two of the central tenets of the armed forces covenant stipulate that no one should be disadvantaged by their service, and that in some cases, special treatment might be appropriate. If we are so intent on fostering closer links between our military and the Commonwealth, how can we continue to turn a blind eye to the problems faced by those who are prepared to make the ultimate sacrice ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,\\nf_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201\\n/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4825979.1541605640!/image/image.jpg","title":"pavement parking should be culturally unacceptable campaigners","story":"They want vehicles obstructing pavements to be popularly frowned on as part of a planned new law to ban the practice.David Hunter, of the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland, told MSPs he backed ldquocreating that culture where it is seen as anti-social to park on a pavement.ldquoIt is not a decent thing to do because it does cause pedestrians problems.He was giving evidence to the Scottish Parliamentrsquos rural economy and connectivity committee on the planned Scottish Governmentrsquos TransportBill, which would outlaw it.Mr Hunter said bin lorries and vehicles loading should not be exempt, as is proposed.He said that would strengthen enforcement.Iain Smith, of Inclusion Scotland, which campaigns for disabled people, said of the ban: ldquoThis is very important for disabled people.ldquoMany are trapped in their house because of vehicles parked on pavements, which means they cannot get out on a wheelchair.He said vehicles also damaged pavements, causing a trip hazard.Mr Smith added that parking beside dropped kerbs should also be made illegal.Inside Transport: Is it time for a pavement parking ban John Lauder, director of cycle path developers Sustrans, said pavement parking had ldquobecome a societal norm, fuelled by more families owning several cars.He said: ldquoIt will take time to change it.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies. LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Ms Blessington revealed: \"It was handmade by Hamish Stone, of Nethy Bridge, and he painstakingly followed the  pages of directions from online to create the pizza oven from the redundant interior walls of the railway station.\"Another attraction is the purpose built Highland games field. Mr Garman has competed for many years on the circuit in his native United States and now nearer to his Revack home although injury prevented him this past season.There will be games demonstrations with the Grantown East staff getting involved too.The venue is horseshoe shaped to allow maximum viewing pleasure. Mr Garman said: \"I have been to hundreds of Highland games fields and the only thing I have always found is the spectators can not get high enough to see what is going on and also get good pictures.\"We will be staging demonstrations as many times as we possible can. We are cross-training all of the staff interested in the Highland games to be demonstrators so they can share the sports in a safe and informative manner too.\"The couple admit it has taken a while to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option for making change in the north. - Declan Kearney MLAThe publication of an open letter to An Taoiseach, LeoVaradkar from over one thousand signatories in the Irish News is a powerfulintervention supporting the rights of Irish citizens in the north of Ireland. December that Irish citizens in the north “would never again be left behind by anIrish government”.These Irish citizens have explicitly urged Leo Varadkar toadhere to his expressed commitment from last year, “and to redouble yourefforts, and the efforts of your government to ensure that our rights areprotected”.Their intervention comes at a time of deepening politicalcrisis, and increased uncertainty and instability caused by the continueddenial of citizens’ rights, and the fast approaching Brexit catastrophe.This initiative indicates the frustration and anger amongrepublicans and nationalists and other progressive minded people about thedenial of rights here, and which are taken for granted where throughoutthese islands.It is outrageous that the northern state remains a rightsback water where language, marriage equality, womens reproductive health andlegacy justice rights, as well as a Bill of Rights are blocked.Northern nationalists are absolutely incensed with thecontinued denial of democracy and democratic rights.They are not prepared to put up with their Irish identitybeing treated with disrespect and contempt.Some of the signatories who have backed this highlysignicant intervention were active supporters of, and participants in theoriginal Civil Rights Movement  years ago.But many more are the children and grandchildren of those whocampaigned and marched in support of modest civil rights reforms and who werebeaten and shot off the streets and roads in the north because the unioniststate refused to deliver equality and rights.These citizens reflect the ersity, depth, confidence andstrength of those who identy as Irish citizens in the north.They represent tens of thousands of others in the north, andfrom right across Ireland, who have invested in the promise and ambition of theIrish Peace Process and Good Friday Agreement . They are articulatingthe voice of a progressive silent majority.However, they also persony a fundamental realignment withinnationalist and progressive opinion, including some sections of civic unionism.A new dangerous tipping point has been created in thepolitical process due to the destructive bigotry of the DUP the combinedefforts of both the DUP and British Government to systematically undermine theGFA, and to impose Brexit and, as a result of their toxic pact.The GFA guaranteed the delivery of equality, rights, parityof esteem and mutual respect.The DUP and others in political unionism have consistentlyopposed it from .Twenty years after the signing of the GFA it has still to befully implemented despite its status as an internationally binding agreement whichhas been laid with the United Nations.As a consequence, both the British and Irish Governments haveobligations as co-guarantors to ensure its implementation.However, the British Tory government turned its back on theGFA since it took power in .Now the DUP, British government and the most extreme elementsin political unionism are engaged in a full frontal assault against theAgreement. Brexit is the antithesis of the GFA.Its imposition will deepen the rights deficit in the northand will further destabilise the political process.That reality goes to the very heart of the existing politicalcrisis in the North, and which blocks the political institutions from beingre-established.A wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Torygovernment. They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/\\nf_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201\\n/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8695614.1541521803!/image/image.jpg","title":"irish language group funding snub claim rejected by dup","story":"A DUP councillor has rejected claims that unionists #snubbed# a request to fund an Irish language event.Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge submitted a request to Mid and East Antrim Council to fund an event as part of Seachtain na Gaeilge , which takes place each March.Sinn Fein councillor Patrice Hardy claimed unionist councillors had “refused to even countenance” the request, adding: “Seachtain na Gaeilge is a hugely positive, global event which this council should be supporting rather than snubbing. “The Irish language community aren’t seeking special treatment, they are only seeking equality.”Last year, Ms Hardy accused the council of being “anti-Irish to the core”, after a move to have the local authority participate in Irish Language Week was rejected following a vote by members. In a statement yesterday, she added: “Despite all the controversy over the previous refusal to fund Seachtain na Gaeilge or even to engage with the Irish language community to discuss this, it appears that some members of the council have learned nothing.”But DUP Councillor Gregg McKeen said Conradh na Gaelige had been treated “the same as any other group” who had made a funding request, by pointing them towards the council’s grants programme.He told the News Letter: “They will be assessed under the same criteria as everyone . It is not that they are being refused funding, but they need to go through the same process as everyone . We don’t want to set them on a pedestal above other groups.”Earlier this year, an Irish language event hosted by then DUP Mayor of Mid and East Antrim was commended by Irish language groups.Mid and East Antrim prepares to remember the fallenPolice linking town incidents and appeal for witnesses Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/\\nf_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201\\n/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8692154.1541176569!/image/image.jpg","title":"mid and east antrim residents asked for views on outdoor recreation","story":"Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is calling on residents to have their say on an outdoor recreation strategy for the area.The council wants as much response as possible from clubs, groups, and lovers of the great outdoors to take part in a public consultation as they draw up proposals that will see which natural assets can be used for the benefit of residents and attract visitors to our borough.With coastline, rivers, uplands and low lands, forests, parks and open spaces, Mid and East Antirm has some of the most fantastic natural assets just waiting to be developed.To get involved, come along to one of three public consultation events, which are being led by Outdoor Recreation NI.

A founding member of the Ballymurphy Massacre campaign and member of Relatives for Justice, Carmel will ask for American support for the campaign at public events and Congressional meetings. MPs have called for an end of former British troopers being “hounded and pursued” by murder investigations, while Theresa May praised the “heroism” of British crown forces who “upheld the law”. RFJ believes that while not specically referring to Ballymurphy, such claims may impact an inquest considering whether British forces upheld the rule of law in the case.AOH Freedom for All Ireland Chair Martin Galvin said: “The Ballymurphy Massacre is a fundamental test of Britain#s ability to give legacy justice. If victims cannot get justice where  people, including a Catholic priest and mother of eight children were killed by British troops, how can we expect justice in any killings or collusion murders where British forces were involved AOH National Vice-President Danny O#Connell and National Secretary Jere Cole recently promised the Ballymurphy families that America would stand behind them in their battle for justice.

Our colleagues in England, Scotland and Wales have already received their pay awards for the current year, backdated to April.\"Yet in Northern Ireland, once again, nurses have been left behind and taken for granted by the Department of Health.

Hopes are definitely rising of a deal.\"The Department of Health has bid for the extra money still needed to fully fund a pay increase similar to England this year. Securing that funding would be a major step towards securing a deal.\"Health unions have been in talks with the department for a number of months regarding this years pay award.It has been claimed that the department initially said it was unable to discuss pay awards due to an absence of ministers.However, union officials said negotiations followed a move by Northern Ireland Secretary of State Karen Bradley to give civil servants greater powers amid the political vacuum at Stormont.RCNsaid a requested pc pay rise for staff on Agenda for Change contracts - the national pay system for almost all NHS staff - was turned down.It is understood departmental officials cannot make a pay award until an overarching Northern Ireland public sector pay policy is set.

This is particularly worrying as I remain unconvinced that the current site can accommodate an extra  or  students, without this having a detrimental effect on their wellbeing and the quality of teaching.ldquoI also have signicant concerns about the impact the single site option would have on traffic in the Saul Road area, given the congestion issues and poor infrastructure already in the town.He said he was ldquoworried about the impact that moving teachers and pupils, which he argued would be inevitable in the transitional phase, would have on timetabling.Cllr Brown said he was ldquoslightly more enthusiastic about a two-school option, though he claimed there was ldquostill a lack of clarity from CCMS about how this would work in practice.He added: ldquoI hope the CCMS can produce more detail on this during the post-consultation stage. Officials have informed us that they hope to implement this amalgamation as early as September .ldquoIf that is the case, much work needs to be done to assuage the concerns of parents, secure long term capital funding mdash and potentially a new site mdash and ensure the inevitable challenges occurring during the transitional period do not become permanent fixtures of any new school.Mr Lyttle said that while Alliance was strongly opposed to academic selection and believed in the need for integration and rationalisation of schools across the province, ldquothese changes must always be made while putting the wellbeing and educational outcomes of children first.He added: ldquoThere does appear to be practical concerns with this proposal, particularly regarding implementation which will need to be addressedany amalgamation is to be delivered in a way that will benefit all pupils.ldquoIt is vital that the concerns of parents and other stakeholders are considered and the change management process is handled in a way which delivers for everyone in the community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Annsborough school forms community forum group  ","story":"A NEW community engagement forum has been launched at Annsborough Integrated Primary School.This exciting new development will involve parents, governors, staff and past pupils working with officers from the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, supported by investment from the Integrated Education Fund.Speaking at the launch last Thursday, Lynda Brown, school principal, said she was pleased at the investment and support being offered by NICIE and the IEF.ldquoThere is a great buzz in the school tonight and itrsquos lovely to see so many parents, governors and families attending from within our local community, she remarked.Ms Brown welcomed Tina Merron, Chief Executive Officer of the IEF, Roisin Marshall, CEO of NICIE, and Denise Morgan, Senior Development Officer with NICIE.She said the school community looked forward to working with them to build on the Integrated education being offered at Annsborough IPS.ldquoWe are keen to work with our local community to ensure that integrated provision is available for all who desire it in future, she added.Ms Marshall said she was ldquodelighted to be at the school to discuss the future growth of integrated education in the area.She remarked: ldquoItrsquos always really nice to get the chance to meet people who are committed to working together for their local communities to ensure that children and adults can have opportunities to work together under one roof mdash Protestant,Catholic, other faiths and none. I have grey admiration for parents and communities who believe in these benefits.ldquoOver the past few years we have witnessed unprecedented growth and interest in Integrated Education as more and more parents recognise the value of educating their children and young people together.ldquoDuring this time we have seen an additional three integrated primary schools transforming to become integrated.

Little was seen of Ards attack in the first half, but with  minutes gone Nathan McShane had to be alert to head an in-swinging corner from Brian Cabraley off the line.McGrady, Branagan and Telford continued to give the Ards defence plenty to think about and with  minutes gone Downpatrick made it -. Branagan worked his way into a good position on the right and fired over a tempting cross that flew into the top left hand corner of the net, giving the visiting goalkeeper no chance.Downpatrick went in at the break, worthy of their three-goal advantage, but they were unable to kick on from there in the second half.Ards were the more aggressive after the break and Downpatrick were put under a certain amount of pressure, but Anthony Doherty, Conor Moore, Nathan McShane and Caolan Logue all defended superbly and provided resolute cover to captain Kieran Gordon in goal.Gordon was only beaten once and that was in the th minute when McCleary tucked away a cross from Dunlop in a clever move.Ards continued to push and probe, but a hard-working Downpatrick side refused to give way and thoroughly deserved their first three points of the season.Downpatrick FC: K Gordon, C Logue, N McShane, C Moore, A Doherty, J Branagan, C McGrady, Adrian McCoubrey, M McGarritty, Andrew McCoubrey, P Telford.

I have been a branch member for  years and we need others to come forward to keep the organisation going. Our numbers have dwindled over the years and we need new blood urgently.Mr Campbell said the current membership was ldquosuccumbing to age, reinforcing Mr Martinrsquos warning thatnew members donrsquot come forward, the branch would have to close.ldquoWe are also looking for poppy collectors to help us and would greatly appreciate ita few volunteers would be prepared to help us out. All we need is for someone to give us an hour or two.ldquoThe situation is that the Downpatrick branch cannot survive with its current membership and we need new people to help us.

But late yesterday it seemed certain to pass without a deal on the UKrsquos withdrawal.Speaking after being briefed by the EUrsquos chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr. Tusksaid he saw ldquono grounds for optimism ahead of the European Council summit.ldquoAs I see it, the only source of hope for a deal for now is the goodwill and determination on both sides, Mr. Tusk told a Brussels press conference.ldquoHowever, for a breakthrough to take place, besides goodwill we need new facts.Mr. Tusk said he would ask Mrs. May whether she had concrete proposals on how to break the impasse saying that only such proposals can determinea breakthrough is possible.Reports from Brussels suggested senior European Commission officials were casting doubt on the prospect of a special Brexit summit being declared for Novemberthere is no movement on the key issue of the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Mrs. May won strong support from Cabinet colleagues on Tuesday as she set out two key ldquosticking points preventing the conclusion of a withdrawal agreement.The issues relate to the ldquobackstop agreement demanded by the EU to avoid a hard Border by keeping Northern Ireland within the European customs area.Mrs. May has countered by offering to keep the whole UK in a customs union, but only for a temporary period.She issued a plea for unity as she said she remained determined to secure a Brexit that would respect the result of the  referendum, protect jobs and security and preserve the Union.ldquoIrsquom convinced thatwe as a Government stand together and stand firm, we can achieve this, she said.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Earlier this year, legislation was passed at Westminster to allow donations and loans of more than £, to parties in NI to be revealed for the first time. However, the law only covers donations made to parties from July  onwards, meaning the CRC money to the DUP is exempt.The CRC is a little known group of pro-union business people chaired by former Scottish Conservatives chairman Richard Cook.However, it appeared that the group had not been the original source of the money to the DUP. Mr Cook and the DUP have always said that the donation met every legal requirement.In evidence to the Commons’ Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Tuesday, the Electoral Commission’s CEO Louise Edwards said the body had received quarterly reports from the DUP about the donations they were given.She told MPs: “If we discover a donation in one of those reports is impermissible then the restrictions are lted and we can talk about that donation.“We cannot talk about donations to the DUP from that period and the reason for that is because having veried those reports the donors on them were permissible.”SNP MP Brendan O’Hara pressed the Commission on the issue, askingit had done everything it could to check the money which went to the DUP was “not of foreign origin” and was permissible under UK law.The Commission’s head of regulations, Claire Bassett replied: “We were satisfied that the donors were permissible”.United Ireland ‘only winning scenario’ after Brexit - report and DUP MP, Gregory Campbell.\"   and DUP MP, Gregory Campbell.\"  Gregory Campbell acknowledges James McClean’s right not to wear a poppy but complains of footballer’s quotation of Bobby Sands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"But she also spoke of her “frustration” that the body is not permitted to publish the identities of donors to NI parties prior to July , adding: “We are restricted by law in what we can say. It is as frustrating for us as it is you.”Ms Edwards also spoke of the “lack of transparency” surrounding political donations in NI during that period, a situation which Mr O’Hara branded “intolerable”.He also enquired about allegations contained in a recent BBC NI Spotlight programme regarding whether there was a common plan between the DUP and the EU referendum campaign group, Vote Leave.Ms Edwards said the Commission had determined there was insufficient evidence to warrant an investigation.try catch     .               ..

Heaven was closed to the unbaptised, as indeed was consecrated Church ground,” Professor Kennedy said.School breaks world scarecrow record Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Sinn Fein Vice President Michelle O#Neill attends the launch of the Costs of Non-Unication - Brexit and the Unication of Ireland report at Europa Hotel in Belfast on Wednesday morning The report examined three potential scenarios: a hard Brexit, in which all of the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, Northern Ireland remaining within the single market and customs union, and the unication of Ireland.It found that a hard Brexit would reduce Northern Ireland’s GDP by . billion eurofrom -.Northern Ireland remaining within the single market and customs union would result in a GDP dip of . billion euro , it said.However, the report found that a united Ireland would see Northern Ireland increase its GDP.   Sinn Fein Vice President Michelle O#Neill with report author Kurt Hubner at the launch of the Costs of Non-Unication - Brexit and the Unication of Ireland report at Europa Hotel in Belfast on Wednesday morning “The only winning scenario is the case of unication where between  and , Northern Ireland would increase its GDP by . billion euro,” the report found.“If political actors nevertheless prefer a hard Brexit, orthey are willing to accept a hard Brexit for overarching political reasons, then they accept willingly high negative economic costs.”The report was produced by Canadian firm KLC Consultants for US-based Irish American organisation KRB Inc.It comes as negotiations intensy over whether the UK and EU will agree a backstop plan, resulting in Northern Ireland remaining within the customs union after Brexit.The issue has become a sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.Presenting the report at the Europa Hotel on Wednesday, one of the authors, Dr Kurt Hubner, said the Brexit referendum has created enormous change.“Since the referendum the whole picture has changed enormously, the macro economic situation has changed enormously,” he said.Family of murdered UDR soldier welcome arrest of John DowneyBrexit: £k donation to DUP ‘permissible’ under law Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“We already have huge opportunity costs and now with the way we tried to develop those scenarios, it is surprising that the unication one is the only one that would produce positive effects.“Whereas with a hard Brexit the losses are already piling up.”Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill and Ulster Unionist Steve Aiken were among those who attended the launch at the Europa Hotel in Belfast on Wednesday.Mr Aiken said he was sceptical about the report.“A figure they say of about  billion euro over the space of a decade is absolutely minuscule and is well within the margin for error,” he said.“I can only presume when they continue to put data into the model, they will suddenly realise something we have known all along - that unication is not an answer and would be a net detriment to Northern Ireland.”He added: “And that is very clear because there is no way we can go from one of the largest economies in the world with close on a three trillion GDP into joining something like the Irish Republic that will have signicant problems going forward, particularlythe Irish Government continue pushing us towards making sure we have a hard Brexit rather than having an appropriate Brexit for everybody.”try catch     .               ..

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A national debate which “we have been swept up in”, he says.While he says there remain serious issues which leave his business, and the rest of Northern Ireland, in the dark, far from seeing the port’s proximity with the border – in fact much of the mass of water is in the Republic – as a negative, Brian believes it could positively position it following Brexit.“We are unique as we are both a UK and European port, which is a fantastic opportunity with Brexit coming up.“We are talking to the City Deal people, the UK and Irish governments along with Donegal.“I think we, along with others, particularly, have an opportunity… there are dficulties we could face, especially with a no deal. We are pleased we can articulate our concerns and still hopefully have practical solutions.“Even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, where we are located, there will need to be good relations. Around %commute from Donegal. They will still need to do that.“In a paradox, it does bring some benefits. We have benefits with this Atlantic gateway – it is under-used, and can be utilised in a way to straddle the border. We are speaking about how we can join the dots.”Brian says the port has been working with Donegal County Council, over plans for its new cruise ship terminal at Greencastle. “We have the ability to import materials into the Irish side in the case of a hard Brexit. It wouldn’t take a huge amount of investment to make that happen.“There’s another dimensioninfrastructure capacity. We have a lot of things in place which is strong.“We have deep water available, and have access to probably the biggest land bank in the British Isles.“Project Kelvin  – the high-speed trans-Atlantic fibre-optic cable connection – runs right past our offices. We have over MW of power right beside us. In terms of the building blocks for basic industrial development, they are all in place.“In effect, a ‘no deal’ hard Brexit would be the ultimate impact… it means additional bureaucracy, would cost our port customers time and money, and might make them look at alternative ports to bring material in.“We are not insulated form the operational side of things. Materials coming in from the rest of the world. What could be an extreme in this, ultimately, it might mean, bringing in two million tonnes a year, % from Europe – that % could be subject to tarfs, or a lot of bureaucracy.”Laying it all out, the key concern ishuge bulk cargo – such as grain or animal feed – has to be ‘unitised’ into separate lorry loads, which require single certication each time.“It could create a fairly substantial bureaucracy around the logistics. That’s the very worst situation.”But business is good. Brian says the port employs  staff directly, but around , indirectly.“The numbers we put out in turnover are really strong, but they are modest in a sense that they don’t reflect the impact of what we do,” he says.“Percentage-wise, it’s mostly about the job creation that comes into the regional economy. “We have reinvested £m in the last few years, have a £m asset base and handle about £.bn in commodities a year.”In the other corner, Brian’s closely involved in Derry’s bid for a City Deal, similar to that submitted by six councils, including Belfast, last month.“We are working really closely with the infrastructure around the City Deal. There are two strands – there is the innovation, which is being led by Ulster University, and there is the infrastructure, which we will be playing a fairly central role in.”So, back to Brexit. What will Brian and his team be doing on the morning of March   “As much as you can do, we will continue as normal,” he said.“We have a number of preparedness scenarios. We are as prepared as I think we can be.“We could be prepared, but log jamsare beyond our control. “I don’t hear anyone talking up, or looking for a no deal outcome. I think Northern Ireland businesses have articulated itvery well, and we are punching above our weight.”The biggest issue is whereby a customer could look to moving where, thus moving trade away from the north west, Brian says.Looking back almost two and half years ago, and examining the current landscape today – whereby the UK is set to leave both the customs union and single market – Brian says: “I would have stayed in the customs union and single market. Our strategy has been to defend and grow – why would anyone want to turn away from the biggest customer base “I am not critical of people who wanted to leave the EU – but the way it has been done has not exactly been helpful. “What we see, in my own personal interpretation, when we talk to politicians, particularly from the UK, that the decision to leave the EU was made onof immigration.“That is what took us on the path. There’s then the second thought of the Irish question. If you can solve the issue for Derry, you can solve it for Dover. I don’t think that was considered when the case for leaving on immigration.“We have been swept up in an alternative, national debate – not something relevant for us.”And what’s next for the port  Brian says it’s been through three successful strategies, so far, in terms of expanding the growth.“It’s about leveraging in the coreand selling out the additional capacity to other capacities.“For example, in our marine, we invested in vessels – dredgers. When not used for our work, we go around the UK and Ireland, and offering expertise to other ports.“The key things we are doing is the strategic aims, to defend and grow – maintaining our core business, with core customers, and then looking to developing the industrial land bank and tourist product.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Danske-cover.jpg","title":"danske bank leading the tech and digital charge","story":"Posted on Monday November  by Ulster Business Danske Bank has taken another leap forward in its support for nurturing and helping to get businesses off the ground. Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
