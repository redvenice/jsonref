This shot of the legendary Diego Maradona was taken by Mark Leech in 1987When Diego Armando Maradona joined Napoli in 1984, 70,000 people flocked to see him arrive at the San Paolo stadium, scarcely able to believe that one of the greatest footballers alive had chosen to join an unsuccessful side from an impoverished part of Italy. Maradona would eventually gift unprecedented riches to Napoli, leading them to a first Scuddeto in their history in 1987, among other achievements, and was dubbed the ‘God of Naples’. This beautiful picture distils the euphoria of that period and recognises Maradona as the leader of his adopted people. However, the good times didn’t last. Asif Kapadia’s riveting 2019 documentary, constructed from over 500 hours of never-before-seen footage, recounted how Maradona became conflicted by his involvement with the mafia. A 15-month punishment for using cocaine and the scandal of fathering a baby, whom he refused to acknowledge as his own, ultimately saw him exiled from Napoli in disgrace.

The Competition and Markets Authority said its six-month investigation into last April’s £90m takeover found it “substantially lessens competition nationally”. It said shoppers could get fewer discounts, receive a lower quality of customer service and enjoy less choice in stores and online.JD Sports, Britain’s biggest sports retailer, hit back at the competition watchdog in a strongly worded statement, claiming the CMA’s findings were “fundamentally flawed”. It vowed to fight them.It said the competition regulator failed to recognise the rapidly changing nature of the UK sports retail market, where a large number of retailers selling third-party brands compete, as well as other online players and the international brands selling directly to customers.The JD Sports executive chairman, Peter Cowgill, said: “The CMA’s provisional decision is fundamentally flawed and demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of our market to an alarming extent, given its six-month review.“The competitive landscape described by the CMA is one which neither I, nor any experienced sector analyst, would recognise. Just take a walk down any major UK high street or search for Nike or Adidas trainers on Google and you can see for yourself how competitive this marketplace really is.”It added: “We cannot comprehend how the CMA concludes that Nike and Adidas will not be significantly stronger competitors in the marketplace over the next few years. Experienced analysts in this sector simply would not recognise this conclusion.“We feel that, in its findings, the CMA has lost sight of its objective to protect consumer interests.”JD Sports has 394 JD-branded stores in the UK and Ireland as well as 120 shops under other brands such as Size? and Footpatrol, while Footasylum has 70 stores. Sports clothing and footwear is a growing market in the UK, worth more than £5bn in 2018.Kip Meek, the chair of the independent group leading the CMA inquiry, said: “We’re currently concerned that shoppers could lose out after the merger, for example through fewer discounts and less choice in stores and online. This could particularly affect younger customers and students, who shop in JD Sports and Footasylum.”The CMA is asking for views on its provisional findings by 3 March and possible remedies by 25 February and will assess all evidence provided before making a final decision. It said: “Its current view is that blocking the deal by requiring JD Sports to sell the Footasylum business may be the only way of addressing these competition concerns.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b987329f5bd17757efcca5fae0e061ec7ee1113a/625_53_4116_2470/master/4116.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a52f7cbb04b8f9894eb75e1c8686f3d4","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of infinite","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘infinite’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘infinite’.Share your photos of what infinite means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 12 February at 10am.

Now senior academics close to Westminster say the government is pressing on with this in a plan that could replicate the four Ofsted categories used for schools, flagging up university courses the government considers inadequate.There are already gold, silver and bronze rankings for teaching in universities under the Teaching Excellence Framework. Some of the UK’s leading universities failed to get the top gold rating, with the London School of Economics being awarded only a bronze. Now, one expert says: “They want a fourth category of something like ‘requires improvement’.” Controversially, graduate earnings are expected to be the bar by which the government will judge courses. Higher education experts warn this would damage the arts and humanities, where starting salaries are typically much lower than in disciplines such as medicine or law.In addition, they warn that universities outside London whose graduates stay on and work locally, rather than moving to the capital for a higher salary, will lose out.Universities fear the government might refuse to provide student loans for “low-quality” courses, threaten universities with removal from the Office for Students’ register if they don’t improve, or shut down courses.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says the government is right to question whether courses are all of a good standard – but says earnings are likely to feature “more than they should” in assessing quality. “When Ofsted goes into a school it judges whether it is a good or bad school based on what is happening there,” he says. “It doesn’t say ‘we think this is a bad school because kids who have been here in the past have got bad jobs’. That is how universities will be judged.”Prof Alec Cameron, vice-chancellor of Aston university, in Birmingham, says: “Salary is evidence of things, including where you live, what sector you’re in, and what sort of job you are pursuing. We should push back against the idea that a good salary is an adequate measure of how much a job matters to society.”Vice-chancellors see the “Ofsted” idea as a government raid on their independence, with the head of a leading research university warning that universities should be in no doubt that the government has “radical” plans, and should prepare for battle. “There are deep issues that we need to confront. Do we really want a world where creative courses have no student loans?”The worry is that courses classed as needing improvement would then struggle. Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at Oxford University, says this could push some struggling universities, especially in poorer areas, to the brink. “Would the government really want to jeopardise its position with voters in the north by doing this?”Prof Nigel Carrington, head of the University of the Arts London, says the data “simply isn’t adequate”. He argues it doesn’t properly take into account those who work part-time while they top up their skills, regional differences in pay, or earnings from self-employment. “If a Cambridge graduate in law earns £50,000 and a law graduate of a university in a deprived area earns £19,000, that doesn’t mean the second graduate isn’t productive. They may be using their legal skills doing valuable work in a local authority.”He adds: “Are we educating our students only to earn money, or to do something they love?”Falmouth, which has a focus on the creative arts, is encouraging its graduates to stay in Cornwall and set up their own businesses. Carlisle says judging courses on graduate salaries would give universities such as hers a perverse incentive not to help their regional economies, but instead to encourage its students to go to London, where could earn more.When graduates launch startups they rarely pay themselves large salaries, even when they secure investment, instead ploughing money back into the business, she says. “Who is driving this PAYE obsession when everything is shifting towards entrepreneurialism? It’s as if time has stopped still in government while the world is moving on.”Erin Morris, who studied animation and visual effects at Falmouth, has set up a tech business with Tanuvi Thunandan, a Cambridge University economics graduate, at Falmouth’s acclaimed Launchpad postgraduate innovation hub. Their company, Data Duopoly, aims to help attractions such as the Eden Project to manage bottlenecks by offering visitors discounts if they avoid busier areas at key times.Morris and Thunandan wanted to be their own bosses, do something creative and live in “beautiful” Cornwall. Although they have received a grant from the South West Technology Network, it only covers their rent and food and “bare living costs”.Morris says: “It depends what you want out of life. Money wasn’t top of my priority list when I chose my course. I want to do something I’m passionate about.”Thunandan agrees: “It seems wrong to judge our success on salary. They should be judging us 10 years down the line when hopefully we will be selling our successful business and making an exciting exit.”Prof Gail Marshall, head of the school of languages and literature at Reading University, says: “For the government to say to students that the thing they do well and are passionate about doesn’t have value is extremely problematic.” She adds: “It seems foolish to pre-judge which subjects are most valuable when we are facing unprecedented challenges like climate change, which need to be solved by different disciplines working together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4181f50e954cdeced4fac153c8b688c94be040e6/0_24_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82c2d2efb7d0f922baaf04514b6e8ce2","title":"counting the cost of australias summer of dread","story":"The world has never seen anything like it.Over five months, bushfires along the south-east coast of Australia have blackened an area bigger than Ireland. They have taken 33 lives, destroyed thousands of homes, shrouded cities in toxic smoke and devastated the country’s unique wildlife.They have also changed how many Australians think about the climate crisis. What was, for many, an abstract idea set in a distant future has, in the space of one summer, begun to feel like a dystopian everyday reality. As leading researchers have observed, Australia is now ground zero in an unfolding catastrophe. Australia has spoken to some of the millions of people touched by Australia\u0027s summer of dread. Here, we take you on a journey through some of the country\u0027s worst-affected areas.And later this week we launch our new series The frontline: inside Australia’s climate emergency. From extreme heat to warming seas, Australia is experiencing the effects of the global climate crisis more rapidly than much of the world. The frontline shows what ground zero looks like for everyday Australians.This map shows the areas that have burned since July 2019.Tip: scroll down to animate the map to new locationsOn 7 January Charlotte O’Dwyer, the 19-month-old daughter of volunteer firefighter Andrew O’Dwyer, held her father’s helmet over her head as the New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, pinned a posthumous service medal to her dress. One week earlier, at another funeral, Fitzsimmons knelt before 19-month-old Harvey Keaton, who was standing solemnly with his dummy in a small firefighter’s shirt, and presented the same medal in honour of Harvey’s father, Geoffrey Keaton.O’Dwyer, 36, and Keaton, 32, died when a falling tree caused their firetruck to roll on 19 December during a shift battling blazes south of Sydney.Thirty-three people have died in or while working to fight bushfires in Australia between 1 October and 31 January. It is the highest death toll for a fire season since the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria on 7 February 2009, in which 173 people died.But the deaths, like the fires themselves, have been spaced out. Black Saturday was one terrible day. This season there has been a succession of terrible days, with little reprieve.Johanna Selth, daughter of Ron Selth, who died in the Adelaide Hills the week before Christmas, told  Australia: “When my sister called me to say that they\u0027d found a body I just couldn\u0027t believe it”. The 69-year-old was found dead near his burnt-out farmhouse. His last communication with his partner was to say that the fire appeared to have passed him by.“It just didn\u0027t seem real,” Johanna says. “I was here in the US in Washington DC and was just like, ‘It can\u0027t be him, there must have been someone else up there, because he knows what he\u0027s doing and he wouldn\u0027t have got caught like that.’”Ron Selth’s identity was reported in the media before police confirmed it. Johanna sat down to tell her children after booking flights back to Australia.“It\u0027s hard being away from home when these sorts of things happen,” she says. Now, back in the US, people stop her in the supermarket when they hear her accent and ask if she knows anyone affected by the fires.“I just have to say, \u0027Yeah, we know some people,\u0027 and then just leave it at that and try to change it to a different subject … because I really don\u0027t want to talk about my dad to strangers,” she says.Johanna and her siblings Luke Selth and Jasmine Berry visited the farm a week later, to find trees still burning and their childhood home reduced to rubble. Even the rose bushes planted by their late mother, who died 18 years ago of leukaemia, had burned.“The whole thing was gone, even all the brick walls had come down so the fire was obviously extremely intense,” she says. “There was just nothing left.”As the sky turned red on New Year’s Eve, Christy Bryar was sheltered on the foreshore of the tiny Victorian coastal town of Mallacoota with thousands of terrified residents and holidaymakers.She’d evacuated her nearby property in Gipsy Point and was face down in the sand.The dramatic scenes from that night were captured on smartphones and seen around the world. Thousands were eventually rescued from the beach by a navy supply ship designed to deal with humanitarian crises.In the end, a wind change saved the town of Mallacoota itself, but about 100 houses in the area were destroyed.Bryar’s was one of them.Her partner, David, a professional firefighter, fought to save their neighbours’ homes.“There were only two homes lost in Gipsy Point, and no lives lost, so I think he did a very good job,” she says. “But he’s feeling the weight of not being able to look after our own house.”When the couple finally made it home days later there was nothing left of their two-bedroom fibro shack. They lost everything on their 10-hectare property: the house, sheds, orchards and animals (although two chickens were found alive in one of the apple trees).“The front hit Gipsy through our place,” Bryar says. “It took the full brunt.” Bryar’s is one of almost 3,000 houses that have been lost across Australia this bushfire season. Still, the couple plan to stay in the fire-prone area.“When you choose to move to a place like this, you\u0027re already aware of the inherent risks of the landscape around you,” she says. “The chance we have now is to build something with that in mind.”“We’ve just experienced something very particular to our town, and there’s great personal loss, but we feel like if we don’t use this both personally and collectively as a catalyst to change, then it sort of seems wasteful in a way.”As the bushfire burned over her house near Conjola on the New South Wales south coast, Samatha Kneeshaw was sitting in her backyard swimming pool hooked up to a scuba tank, forcing herself to remain under the water.Her house appeared to be on fire. There were embers falling in the water. And she was angry: at the government, for not acting on the climate emergency, and at the fire itself.“I just thought I\u0027d lost all of this beautiful bushland and that was devastating me, and, bloody hell, I had lost the house too,” she says. “It was hard to keep under, but I had to because the embers and the smoke and stuff was just horrendous above.”Sheltering in a pool is against the advice of authorities: a hot enough fire or an insufficiently large pool and it’s like a frog in a kettle.Kneeshaw can’t recall the temperature of the water. Adrenaline narrowed her focus to a series of tasks. She didn’t know she had saved the house until after the front had passed. “I didn\u0027t notice myself getting hot ... either but I must have been because I sprayed myself down a couple of times fighting the fire,” she said. “I didn\u0027t notice any sounds — people talk about roaring sounds — I have no memory of any sounds. It\u0027s funny what adrenaline does to you.Now, she says, she has “baby brain” but for the bushfires: “When I am talking to people about other things I can\u0027t finish sentences.”The fire hit on New Year’s Eve. It had been one or two kilometres west of their four-hectare bush block, which had been a wildlife haven, for 10 days.Kneeshaw, a high school teacher with a PhD in carbon uptake rates and a 20-year-old scuba ing kit, was home alone. Her two daughters, dogs and husband were in nearby Ulladulla. If my kids were here I would have left,” she says.The house was fully insured for bushfires and she knew the risk of staying. A hundred homes and two lives were lost in the same fire. But Kneeshaw never felt she might not survive, and says she would “stupidly” do the same thing again.“But I\u0027m risking a lot — I’m risking not seeing my children, my children not seeing me again,” she says.When fire threatened again five days later she sent her family away and sat on the roof with a fire hose in hand. “I wasn\u0027t going to lose it once I\u0027d saved it,” she says. The bushfire season for Greg Hodges started in September, when the north of NSW “kicked off”. The strike team leader for the northern beaches headquarters\u0027 brigade was deploying crews on three- and five-day deployments to hugely destructive fires, hundreds of kilometres away from base, in the springtime.This fire season wasn’t normal, and the toll on paid and volunteer firefighters would be enormous. Ten would die across three states.The federal government has funded extra mental health services to deal with the anticipated rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and trauma among emergency service workers and bushfire victims.Hodges, a 45-year-old holder of four trades, has spent three decades in emergency services. A straight-talking tradie, he has thoughts he isn’t afraid to share.“Let’s just hope the bad stuff that’s happened this season is used as a learning tool to try and improve things for next season,” he says.“Because if you don’t, the fireys that lost their lives have been wasted. I didn’t know any of them personally at all, but it sort of hits hard at home when it could’ve been one of your mates that went out that day.”Hodges’ strike team has crisscrossed the state, defending towns that are now synonymous with loss. Bargo, Bilpin, Nelligen, Adaminaby.Nelligen was a shit fight, he says. Misinformation, a disappearing crew, hostility — and seven houses lost.Then, when it was over, Hodges had to tell the families.“The service doesn’t train you for it,” he says, adding that it’s a burden he refuses to put on his crew members.“You’ve got families standing there in tears, and kids crying, and they’ve got nothing left. I’d rather be upfront and honest with them, and tell them so they can start dealing with it then and there.”There are streets in Sydney that Hodges doesn’t drive down because it would trigger his own PTSD and, while he knows it’s coming from a good place, he’d like strangers to stop asking him in the street about the fires he’s been to.Bilpin was midnight-dark in the mid afternoon when everything “hit the fan” and the fire came back for a second go. Buildings ignited and there was nothing anyone could do.Firefighters were caught in the flames a few times, Hodges says.“You can be as careful and pre-emptive as you want, but sometimes shit just does happen, and you can be in the wrong place at the wrong time.”“Bilpin doesn’t trigger me that much, nothing really. To me it was just a fire. We lost a couple, but we had some fucking great saves. Some really good saves, and that’s how you’ve got to look at it, with everything.”At least 19.4m hectares have burned in Australia since July 2019. A large part of that is in the remote northern savannah — which burns frequently — but even excluding those areas, the scale of these fires is immense.In the more densely populated areas of southern Australia at least 7.7m hectares have burned. This figure is hard to visualise, so here we show 7.7m hectares as a single area.It is roughly the size of the Czech Republic, or about three times the size of Wales.When Nan Nicholson saw smoke rising from the Terania Creek basin, one of the wettest places in NSW, she knew something strange was happening.The area is part of the Nightcap national park, which is one of Australia’s Gondwana rainforest world heritage reserves.It was 8 November 2019 — not yet summer in Australia — but by that night the whole basin “had erupted like a volcano”, Nicholson says.“It was one of the most shocking things I’ve ever witnessed. It was just utter disbelief that this thing could burn at all, let alone the rainforest, the wettest of the wet, could be burning.”Nicholson and her husband have lived in Terania Creek for more than 40 years. They were instrumental in the push to stop logging of the area, hosting blockades on their farm in the late 1970s.The protest resulted in not just the Nightcap, but all remaining rainforest areas in NSW, being declared as national park.The Gondwana reserves are subtropical rainforests that  366,500 hectares from Newcastle in NSW to south-east Queensland. These ancient forests are habitat for rare and threatened plant and animal species and are home to trees that have lived for 600 to 1,200 years.Kooyman and other scientists have set up research plots to monitor the effects of the fires. In some areas there will be recovery but the impact will remain. The rainforests will be changed. Mortality will continue. Tree death can be quick sometimes, or it can be slow.Nicholson, who watched those first flames from a grassy hill on her property in November, says the fire at Terania Creek burned through into January.Her favourite brush box, more than 1,000 years old, was destroyed. “It was one of the worst things walking up and realising that that old friend had gone,” she says.Kangaroo Island’s glossy black cockatoos are thought to live as long as 50 years. The birds are monogamous, and pairs stay together outside breeding times.After fledglings hatch, the flock gather to socialise and show off their young — sometimes hanging out and arguing. Females do the nest building. Males are often seen flustered while looking after screeching chicks.It had taken 25 years of work by conservationists and hundreds of local volunteers to bring the island’s glossy black cockatoos back from the brink. Now it is unknown how many of the birds are still alive.In 1995 there were just 158 “glossies” left across seven flocks — the last remaining populations in South Australia. “The population was slowly increasing,” says Karleah Berris, of Natural Resources Kangaroo Island. “We think just before the fires we had about 400 birds.”Days after the fire, Berris joined others to walk through the fire grounds to see what was left. They couldn’t find any dead cockatoos but did find dead wedge-tailed eagles — a highly mobile bird that is usually able to escape fires.“We were asking where all the animals were,” she says. “But then we realised it was just little piles of bones — the fires burned so intensely the bones just crumbled in our hands.”The cockatoos are just one of what scientists fear are hundreds of species devastated by the bushfire crisis. One early estimate suggests more than a billion animals have been killed. More than 100 threatened animal and plant species have lost at least half of their known habitat.There are three subspecies of glossy black cockatoos — northern, southern and Kangaroo Island — and all three are on threatened species lists.The island’s glossies are especially vulnerable because their beaks, tongues and dextrous claws have evolved for them to feed almost exclusively on the seed cones of drooping sheoak trees.The island’s fires were concentrated on its western side but there’s hope that one flock of about 100 birds in the east might be an insurance policy.“But to think all this work of 25 years has been devastated… it’s hard because there’s so much loss on so many levels here,” Berris says.“The ancestors would be wild, I reckon, about what’s happened to the country, to our totem animals,” says Warren Foster, a Yuin man from Wallaga Lake.Heritage experts say thousands of secret, sacred and important Aboriginal sites may have been damaged by the blazes. Around Australia there are at least 7,062 registered sites within fire-affected areas, but this figure only includes those that have been formally acknowledged under state and territory legislation. Traditional owners and heritage experts say there are many more.The Yuin people on the NSW south coast are deeply worried that hundreds of their sacred sites have been wiped out between Gulaga (Mount Dromedary) and Mumbulla Mountain, north of Bega. The two peaks are part of a chain of important Aboriginal cultural sites stretching from the Shoalhaven to the Victorian border.Yuin traditional owners say they are keen to go out on country to assess the damage to sites, some of which are in remote bushland and can only be reached on foot.These places have “been there for thousands of years”, Foster says. “But once it’s gone you never get it back.”Heritage NSW, which manages the register of Aboriginal protected sites, says it’s too early to say exactly how many sites have been affected. The NSW Aboriginal Land Council has appointed bushfire support coordinators to help communities access mainstream and Aboriginal-specific support, including trauma counselling. Its chief executive, James Christian, says it will help people identify and assess Aboriginal culture and heritage impacted by the bushfires.The Australian Archaeological Association — which represents heritage professionals, researchers and traditional custodians — has called for urgent visits to known sites to survey the damage. It wants the federal government to make sure Australia’s “rich cultural heritage” is included in every bushfire recovery plan.Foster says: “It’s never gone up like this. Our people never knew fires like this … We need our country to be healthy so we can be healthy. We need the animals. If that is all lost, our spirits die when they die.“This might be a wake-up call for them now to listen to us Indigenous people on how we do our cultural burning. It’s time to ask us how to look after the country.”The roar of an out-of-control bushfire is deafening. For many that noise, and the dark, apocalyptic skies the blazes bring with them, defines the terror of our summer bushfire season.But for the Singleton GP Bob Vickers, it’s the silence that brings fear. That moment when a patient is so overcome by an asthma attack that their airways begin to shut down. No energy to speak, no sound in their chest.“Their oxygen levels start to drop off, they can become blue in the lips … it can get to the point where the airways close off completely, which is an emergency, and it is difficult to treat.”Vickers has seen the effect of the bushfires on patients in his local area, increasingly seeking treatment for the health effects of smoke exposure: burning, itchy eyes and throats, and asthma symptoms, even in people not previously diagnosed with the condition and so without potentially life-saving medications.He says climate change and worsening bushfires will create the conditions for more catastrophic events like the thunderstorm asthma attacks in Victoria, in which 10 people died and 14,000 were taken to hospital.And the more insidious effects will be far-reaching. “It’s not just the bushfire smoke, we often see the long-term effects of bushfires in terms of the effect on mental health,” he says.Exposure to the fine PM2.5 particulate matter and chemicals in bushfire smoke has also been linked to a number of health conditions, including stillbirth, low birthweight and early birth, and heart and lung problems.“Definitely long-term there will be an increase in deaths from multiple causes,” Vickers says. “I think we are just going to see a shift in what is expected and what is normal.“In Australia doctors expect to be working a Saturday morning in the emergency department and to see people coming in with rolled ankles and shoulder dislocations from weekend sport. I think we are going to see less of that — particularly if there’s less weekend sport as a result of bushfire smoke. But we are going to be seeing things like heat stress, and airway exacerbation from bushfire smoke, and more mental health presentations to a GP setting. This is something doctors are aware of.“You will also see more deaths with people with chronic disease that is being exacerbated by weather changes, either extreme heat or lack of access to water, or even good quality food.”Amy Corderoy and Lisa Cox"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/356f633012d9a5083bc7c3adb8941fd60d8cd55e/571_36_1316_789/master/1316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38a59db0627988e8bcfc683cd9a7b10c","title":"down the rabbit hole why is matrix dressing so on trend","story":"From tiny sunglasses to leather coats, the film’s costume designer Kym Barrett writes about why the film’s look feels so relevant in our uncertain world • Read more from the springsummer 2020 edition of The Fashion, our biannual style supplementI never thought The Matrix would have the impact it has had on fashion. But from long leather coats to so-called “Matrix-style” sunglasses, the costumes I designed in the 90s continue to have influence to this day.Part of the reason they are still in the ether is because they were so iconic. The silhouettes, for instance, had to be instantly recognisable so that viewers could tell who each character was, even in the dark. All of the costumes are fairly immune to period, which is what makes them relatable, even now.I always work from character when designing costumes. Trinity wants to move through the world of the Matrix like quicksilver, so she wears shiny clothes. Her costumes also had to be figure-hugging because she’s always getting herself in tight situations, so she can’t have anything that’s going to impede her movement.Neo grew up in the Matrix, so when he gets the chance to come back and do some good – to fulfil his mission – he creates a superhero version of himself. I made Keanu’s coat so that it looked like a cross between an ancient Chinese robe and an ecclesiastical garment I had to emboss leather made at Libra Leather in New York City to make it look like crocodile.I think maybe the reason people are circling back to The Matrix now is that the world is in a dire situation, just as it was in the universe of the film. The characters were sustaining themselves very minimally because of the scarcity of resources – when someone died, the others took their clothes and remade them into something else for someone else. It chimes with what’s happening now in terms of the increasing emphasis on recycling clothes and thrift shopping. It is not the time for ostentation in the world, or in fashion.Beyond fashion there are other parallels, such as the current conversation around the climate crisis. Of course, when the first Matrix came out, no one was talking about that specifically, but what was happening in the film – humans being oppressed in order to extract more wealth at the expense of the planet – is also happening in the world today.Now, sadly, the kind of chaos that was imagined in the film is taking place in reality. Last year, for example, I was in California during the fires there. Now I am in Sydney. Governments are all talking about how the environment is important, but saying that keeping industry moving is more important. That’s a huge worry – the kind of catastrophe that led to the world of The Matrix feels as though it could be around the corner here, too. If the continued interest in the film, and its fashion, is a way to reach people and wake them up to that message, then I’m all for it.As told to Ellie Violet Bramley"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b30aab7d595c63fc4b0972b90127640c1a14a20/2_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e7be51f7dff14bf17757730afa20a5f","title":"game set mismatch mens clashing prints in pictures","story":"Let rip with pattern, says our menswear editor – pair artichokes with animal print or tweed with florals• Read more from the springsummer 2020 edition of The Fashion, our biannual style supplement"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/051d75522034d77390b47da1d3bb280a284e429e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa702452a933b1cbcc7735fad8e259d0","title":"oscars 2021 who might be next years big winners","story":"It was a big night for Academy favourites Joaquin, Renee, Laura and Brad and looking ahead, there might be some more familiar faces in the mix yet againThis time last year, not many could have easily predicted that the best actor Oscar would be won for a role in a comic book movie or that best picture would go to a South Korean thriller about class warfare so there’s an understandable eye-roll that often meets predictions as early as this.But with some contenders already revealing themselves at this year’s Sundance film festival and with projects gaining early buzz elsewhere, here’s a slightly educated guess at who could be in next year’s race.Partly dethroned golden boy Will Smith (the last year saw him in one megaflop – Gemini Man – and one megahit – Bad Boys for Life) has struggled with his more awards-aiming projects. While he bagged nominations for Ali and The Pursuit of Happyness, Oscarbait like Concussion, Seven Pounds, Collateral Beauty and The Legend of Bagger Vance were not only rejected by the Academy but by everyone else as well. There’s something safer-sounding about King Richard though, a biopic of Richard Williams who coached his daughters Venus and Serena to global success in the world of tennis. It’s also a rare chance to see him work with an up-and-coming director, Monsters and Men’s Reinaldo Marcus Green, who should hopefully push him out of his comfort zone.After six nominations, it was assumed by many that her seventh would lead to her first win but in 2019 Glenn Close lost out on the best actress Oscar to Olivia Colman, a shock result that leaves her as arguably the most loved yet least rewarded actor in Hollywood. While her Sundance opioid drama Four Good Days is unlikely to lead to much despite the worthy subject matter, a plum role in Ron Howard’s adaptation of JD Vance’s hit memoir Hillbilly Elegy could see her named best supporting actress this time next year. She plays Mamaw, the grandmother who raised Vance in a drama for which Netflix recently won a bidding war, making it their big Oscar hope for 2021.Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson may not have emerged as the runt of the litter of Tom Hooper’s Razzie-winning Cats but her big scene, belting out Memory underneath a horrifying melange of CG fur, didn’t quite have the traction her similarly big number in Dreamgirls had. She’s on safer ground later this year as Aretha Franklin in Respect, a long-gestating biopic that the singer herself helped to develop before her death. Hudson had been the top choice from the start, with the blessing of Franklin, and was also picked by her family to sing at the funeral in 2018. An early teaser doesn’t show much but confirms that at least vocally, she’s the perfect choice.Even though his directorial debut Molly’s Game didn’t exactly land in the way many had hoped, it still bagged Oscar-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin an adapted screenplay nomination, a sign that even on an off day, the Academy still loves him. His next film, fact-based drama The Trial of the Chicago 7 has a much more awards-y sell, telling the story of the men charged with conspiracy and incitement to riot after protesting against the Vietnam war in 1968. It’s a project that’s been in development in some form since 2007, with Steven Spielberg, Heath Ledger, Paul Greengrass and Will Smith all attached at various points. The cast now includes former winners Eddie Redmayne and Mark Rylance as well as nominees Michael Keaton and Frank Langella, suggesting potential awards all round.The first time Viola Davis won an Oscar, in 2017, it was for a role in Denzel Washington’s adaptation of August Wilson’s Fences and later this year she’ll be hoping for a second lightning strike with Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, another Wilson adaptation, this time produced by Washington instead. She’s playing Ma Rainey, one of the first professional black blues singers, and the film, based on the Tony-nominated play, details the struggles she faced with the making of her album with bandmates, her producer and her white agent. It’s another Netflix hopeful and given their most recent set of nominations, if not wins, it should be a solid contender.Despite the high-wattage cast that surrounded her in Rian Johnson’s smash-hit whodunnit Knives Out, it was Ana de Armas that emerged for many as the MVP, nabbing a Golden Globe nomination as a result. It’s a big year for her with roles in the new Bond outing No Time to Die as well as opposite Ben Affleck in the marital thriller Deep Water, but her biggest opportunity is playing Marilyn Monroe in Blonde, an adaptation of the novel by Joyce Carol Oates from The Assassination of Jesse James director Andrew Dominik. It’s a fictionalised portrait of the star from Netflix and Brad Pitt’s Plan B production company, which backed 12 Years a Slave and Moonlight, and early pictures of the star as Monroe suggest at the very least, an impressive physical transformation.At a rather underwhelming edition of Sundance last month, there was one film which everyone could agree on: Minari. The gentle, soulful Korean-American coming-of-age tale was so universally charming that it won not only the grand jury prize but the audience award as well. It felt like the start of a long journey to the Oscars for backers A24 and the writer-director Lee Isaac Chung, who based the film on his own experiences of growing up in rural Arkansas. It might be too quiet for some voters but its humane view of the immigrant experience will also resonate with many and Chung could find himself up for best original screenplay at the very least.Although Frances McDormand made a show of how much she “hated” every second of her awards season back in 2018, she managed to amass a bounty of trophies for her role in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, including the best actress Oscar. Next year she could be competing against herself with two intriguing projects in the race. First is Nomadland, the director Chloe Zhao’s follow-up to The Rider, which has the actor playing “a van-dwelling modern-day nomad” who goes on the road after losing everything in the recession and she’ll also be re-teaming with Joel Coen for a new vision of Macbeth also starring Denzel Washington.After seeing Anthony Hopkins in The Father at this year’s Sundance film festival, a devastating drama that puts us in the mind of someone with Alzheimer’s, it seemed impossible that any other performance would have a shot of winning best actor in 2021. A true jaw-dropper of a turn, the kind that makes you want to leap to your feet to applaud at the end, it’s an early frontrunner that will be hard to top. Hopkins, who had been wasted in a string of thankless and often overly hammy roles for too long, is back in the Academy’s favour after a nomination this year for The Two Popes and next year would make it the 30th anniversary of his win for The Silence of the Lambs. The film, based on the acclaimed play by Florian Zeller, could also be a major contender, along with co-star Olivia Colman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c25c7dc9c3f157695c7e08b1a7897f7273145ff/280_186_3547_2129/master/3547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24361014a5fea6a14ba3f2ed8d782d72","title":"oscars 2020 in pictures gallery","story":"From bashful Brad Pitt to James Corden and Rebel Wilson as cats, a selection of the best pictures from the 92nd Academy Awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65797dc2587c582ef4fc67ab964472404f6ade7a/0_1347_5046_3026/master/5046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c8f23c44bbff67124f2d3c00b31a16f","title":"nigel slater midweek meal seafood salad langoustine potato","story":"This seafood salad is an indulgent but incredibly simple supperScrub 350g of small potatoes then cook them, in their skins, in deep, lightly salted boiling water for about 15 minutes until tender.

Rather than promoting to the watching world Everton’s sponsor, the Kenyan betting giant SportPesa, the players wore a name across their shirts that looked very much more appropriate for the self-styled “people’s club”: their own Everton in the Community programme.It was a one-off, Everton taking advantage of the single match a season when clubs generally can promote a good cause rather than their commercial sponsor, which, for 10 of the 20 Premier League clubs, is an online gambling company. Palace were wearing the name of theirs, ManBetX, reported to be a Filipino-owned sports betting and casino outfit, operated by a company registered in Malta.Sporting the name of their well‑regarded community programme looked right for Everton and a clear solution to two major challenges for the Premier League highlighted by the new chief executive, Richard Masters, in his first media interviews last week. First and most obviously, as the government begins its review into gambling regulation, which was unleashed so dramatically in 2005 after decades of behind‑frosted‑glass restrictions, it would be such a better look for clubs.Masters talked about resisting any moves to ban gambling sponsorships, saying football and betting have a long association – which felt like an unattractive, unconvincing line the league has decided to take. He acknowledged that “governance” should be stronger, “particularly to protect the vulnerable”, but said that overall the Premier League is not “sniffy or judgmental” about its embrace by gambling.It seemed an oddly casual approach. The alarm is being sounded more strongly than ever now about the transformation of sport’s traditionally controlled association with gambling into relentless marketing online, on shirts, on hoardings, on television.The legal relaxations coincided with the revolution in mobile phone use, which has made gambling, mostly on apps, much more immediate and, some experts say, more addictive. Dr Darragh McGee of the University of Bath has warned of the “gamblification” of football after he studied the lives of young men who could no longer watch a game without betting on it and suffered dire consequences to their finances, mental health and relationships.One of the most heart-wrenching campaigns for stronger regulation is Gambling with Lives, set up by Charles and Liz Ritchie after their son Jack, a sociable, “normal” young man and football lover, killed himself in 2017 aged 24, having become addicted to gambling.The area around Goodison Park is one of the country’s most deprived and the community programme works with residents, refugees and people who are homeless or suffering addiction problems.The club’s chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, ran the community programme first and Everton are committed to continuing this work when they move to their planned new stadium on Bramley Moor Dock. Barrett‑Baxendale acknowledged at the club’s AGM last month that “in an ideal world” they would prefer a “different type of sponsor” than a gambling company.SportPesa grew and became vastly profitable in the relatively unregulated gambling environment of Kenya, where senior politicians soon became alarmed at the levels of addiction and indebtedness of young people drawn into online betting.Masters and the clubs are more likely to gain the wider appreciation they seek if their good works are not perceived to be jarring with commercial voraciousness, evidenced most clearly by selling their shirts to gambling companies. If the clubs turn such sponsorships down and promote their own programmes, their claim to have their communities at the heart of who they are will be more credible, and mean more, because they will have put their money on it.For free help and advice about problem gambling visit BeGambleAware.org or call the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d97d2e7df47ce1f38ec6ebafb19e00920a4714e4/0_89_4758_2856/master/4758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2b8c3086560c290dc50cffe8d6226e9","title":"golden goal pajtim kasami fulham v crystal palace 2013","story":"A Van Basten-esque chest and volley – with the midfielder’s weaker foot – was a masterclass of instinct and execution“Wow! Bloody hell!” exclaims Pajtim Kasami as he watches back his volley for Fulham against Crystal Palace six years later. It is the goal the Switzerland international’s time in England will be remembered for.Full-back Sascha Riether was situated just inside his own half when he saw Kasami make his run. Riether chipped the ball to the edge of the box, where the midfielder controlled it with his chest before immediately volleying, while still on the move, over Julián Speroni and into the top corner from the right-hand side of the area. It was Van Basten-esque in terms of its execution – with his weaker foot – but with the added joy of intelligence to sprint into position and control it perfectly.“Everything happened so fast. It’s a goal of instinct you score it and don’t think about it too much but after you realise: ‘Wow, what a goal’,” Kasami explains. “At the moment you don’t really realise what a goal you have scored. It was a perfect goal with the pass, the run I made, the way I controlled it and then hit it with my weaker foot, everything was on point.”Kasami had brought Fulham level and they went on to win 4-1 that October night at Selhurst Park. It should have been a result to ignite a season for a side including Dimitar Berbatov and Damien Duff but instead they would lose their next seven matches and by the time they next won, Martin Jol had been sacked and replaced by René Meulensteen.“It was my breakthrough year in the Premier League I was very young at Fulham, I had arrived from a very good team in Italy and joined an excellent one with the likes of Damien Duff, Bobby Zamora, Steve Sidwell, Scott Parker and Dimitar Berbatov. We had a very good and strong team but we didn’t get the results and the new chairman, Shahid Khan, changed the coach and after things were different.“It was my third year at Fulham. I was starting, playing almost every game and in a very confident mood as I was at Fulham in the Premier League. I got attention from a lot of teams as well. I became a regular for the Switzerland team, so it was a very good moment but, unfortunately, we were not having a good season. Personally, I had a very good spell but the results weren’t good and Berbatov left in January and things changed a lot after.”It wasn’t just the goal that make the spell special for Kasami, he felt very settled in London and was finally a regular after a tumultuous time since arriving from Palermo in 2011. After Fulham’s relegation was confirmed under their third manager of the season, Felix Magath, Kasami departed for Greece.“I have made some not so good decisions in my career which I start to pay for now. I had a very good spell after Fulham with Olympiakos, where we won the league and played in the Champions League. My agent pushed me to leave England, that agent was Mino Raiola. Personally, it was going well but the team went down and I was very frustrated and disappointed by what happened. To be honest I was willing to leave England and the Premier League but in the end it was not a good decision.”At the end of 2019 the lists were drawn up for the Premier League’s goal of the decade, which Kasami featured highly on, giving people a reminder of the natural talent the 27-year-old possesses.As Fulham try to make their way back to the top-flight once again, their supporters are always keen to be reminded of happier times. “The fans tweet me sometimes, especially on the anniversary. The Premier League Twitter account posted it and Fulham retweeted it, so I got fans saying: ‘What a goal’, ‘You should come back’ and things like that. It’s always nice to get a positive reaction and love.”Kasami hopes to play in England again but knows he will not be able to recreate his once-in-a-lifetime goal, although he will be more than happy to try."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/224bb6ddfe7fecfb1e0944fc71b6917bc13cb967/0_316_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e27ba435cd7dd323e4b2bb492f70b4b3","title":"manchester united apply to install rail seating at old trafford","story":"Manchester United have made a proposal to install rail seating for up to 1,500 supporters at Old Trafford.

Over the weekend boats continued to arrive on the Agean islands, sending more families into “alarming” and overcrowded conditions in the refugee camps.The Moria camp in Lesbos has grown from a population of 5,000 last July to around 20,000, with new families arriving daily. Even the most vulnerable new arrivals can no longer find space in the official area, but have to build makeshift shelters in a rubbish-filled olive grove around the camp.UNHCR spokesperson Andrej Mahecic said: “More than 36,000 asylum seekers are now staying in reception centres across five islands which were originally designed for 5,400 people. We are seriously concerned about the limited access to health services at the reception centres which is aggravated by the difficult living conditions.“Greece has been generous and compassionate towards refugees, despite a very complex and difficult situation, and the East Aegean islands have taken on a vastly disproportionate burden and responsibility. It is critical that other regions in Greece step up their solidarity to help alleviate pressures by receiving transferred asylum seekers and opening up reception places.“There is an urgent need for the government to speed up the implementation of its plans to move thousands of asylum seekers from the islands to the mainland.”More than 42,000 men, women and children are estimated to be on Lesbos, Samos, Chios, Leros and Kos. Unable to leave because of a containment policy determined by the EU, they are forced to remain on the islands until their asylum requests are processed by a system both understaffed and overstretched.Dr Hana Pospisilova is a consultant cardiologist who regularly volunteers on Lesbos. She told the  that she has serious concerns that the failure to treat very sick and vulnerable iniduals could lead to a major public health crisis.“I am an experienced doctor, I have seen many patients in my life, but what I saw there had me crying. I saw many children I was worried would die because they were suffering malnutrition. I met a baby who smelled bad his mother had not washed him for weeks because there was only cold water and she was worried he would die.“There are children, between 12 and 15, living in the olive grove and they are barefoot. A lot of them have scabies and we can’t treat it because they have to wash. But they say to wash means waiting three hours and it’s risky: people have knives, and you can only have two minutes in the shower after you wait.“I tell them they need to discard their clothes and they say ‘I have only these clothes.’ They have had them on for seven months. I saw everyday 20 people and all 20 had a horror story.”Her main concern is that the dire conditions could lead to a pandemic.“ I saw many people with respiratory problems and even though it’s cold, it’s winter, we are sending these people back to wet tents in an overcrowded camp. I am worried about a pandemic breaking out. They don’t have hot water, they have to wait three hours in the cold for food, they aren’t getting enough vitamins so many have bleeding gums.“People come and go to the medical facilities, they take antibiotics, they are still coughing, they still have a temperature.

We are treating patients but nobody is healed, it’s impossible to heal them in these conditions.”Doctors currently on the island have been warning that conditions are so bad lives are being put at risk on a daily basis.The UN also warned that since July last year asylum seekers have no longer been issued with the unique number which grants them access, free of charge, to the state healthcare system. As a result, outside of emergency support, asylum seekers – including those with chronic conditions – are unable to access state-provided treatment and medication.Last week the region’s most senior official likened the situation on Lesbos to a “powder keg ready to explode”.

We will minimise it but it is an inevitability of our departure,” he told delegates at a Cabinet Office event held in central London on Monday, entitled Preparing Our Border for the Future Relationship.“I don’t underestimate the fact that this is a significant change, but we have time now to make that change.”Gove, who as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is de facto deputy prime minister, also warned delegates it could take five years to get a smart border involving online processes up and running and said businesses had to be ready for the change next January, whatever the outcome of the next phase of Brexit negotiations.“In questions and answers his officials talked of an ‘operational border’ from the beginning of 2021, which they said was laying the foundation for best borders in 2025,” said one delegate, who reported that Gove had warned the UK must be ready for the completion of Brexit on 1 January next year when the transition period ends.Later the government issued an official update confirming checks on both imports and exports.The update warned that the “policy easements put in place for a potential no-deal exit will not be reintroduced as businesses have time to prepare”.The “easements” that will not apply include deferred VAT payments on imports, which the government had considered in a no-deal plan.Echoing Boris Johnson’s comments in a speech last week, Gove spoke of pursuing a Canada or Australian-type deal, which EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has said was “code for no deal” as the bloc does not have a deal with Australia.According to attendees, Gove was also adamant that the government would stick to its vow to no longer follow EU rules that would allow it to minimise future barriers in cross-border trade.“The only way in which you could avoid those customs procedures and regulatory checks would be if you were to align with EU law and if you were to align with EU law we would be undermining the basis on which the prime minister secured the mandate at the general election to affirm our departure,” Gove said in comments that were recorded.However, Gove did seem to distance himself from recent comments by the chancellor, Sajid Javid, that suggested business should stop complaining about future trade barriers as they have known about Brexit since 2016.The Food and Drink Federation raised concerns about the lack of time to deliver the plans adding that “any additional friction into the UK-EU trading relationship will inevitably have a cost for businesses, consumers and shoppers”.It called on the government to “lead the way” and “proceed at pace” to start building the border inspection posts and ensure regulators such as the Food Standards Agency have sufficient resources for “these new responsibilities”. Elizabeth de Jong, the Freight Transport Association’s UK policy director, said: “Gove put to rest Javid’s assertion that industry had plenty of time to prepare. It is encouraging for industry that he said he does not underestimate what needs to be done.”She also raised concerns that the IT systems would not be ready until 2025. “We are naturally disappointed that the promise of frictionless trade has been replaced with a promise that trade will be as seamless as possible but not until 2025, with a more realistic but costly ‘make do and mend’ approach to be employed until then.”Richard Ballantyne, chief executive of the British Ports Association, said: “We may not like what we are hearing, but if you get a clear message than you can plan.”Jill Rutter, senior research fellow at UK in a changing Europe tweeted that the move will see a “massive increase in red tape”.Gove’s address is the first official confirmation on the detailed border checks to come, something industry leaders particularly in car manufacturing and in agriculture have campaigned against.He told the London event it was the government’s aspiration to make sure trading with the EU was “as smooth and trouble free as possible” but that “we also need to ensure that people are ready for the regulatory checks that will follow”.“It will be the case almost everybody who is exporting will need to complete customs declarations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61590dcdb3157eab1b58d320d6484ff7a313f9b6/0_118_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cefad62140626dc0c34698900f7d0da","title":"how london got rid of private cars and grew more congested than ever","story":"Britain’s biggest city has almost ground to a halt, thanks to the rise of Uber, delivery drivers – and cycle lanes. Can anything be done to end the gridlock and pollution?High Holborn on a bleak winter morning is a portrait of traffic hell. Vehicles grind east to west through an orange maze of construction and utility works. John Lewis and Argos trucks jostle with Thames Water vehicles at one point, a flood of white vans appears in sequence, as if a fleet controller had ordered an invasion of the West End of London. Black-cab drivers lean on their steering wheels for support one holds his head in his hands. The last passenger on a static number 8 bus hovers by the doors, hoping forlornly that the driver will release him into the streets.In the few visible cars, there are no-smoking stickers that identify them as rides for hire. In the melee, one type of vehicle seems almost completely absent: the private car.“London has achieved the impossible by eradicating the private car – and still having desperate traffic congestion,” says Prof Tony Travers, the director of LSE London, a research centre at the London School of Economics that explores the city’s economic and social concerns. “People keep saying we need to get the cars off the road. In central London, there aren’t any.”The idea of blocking cars from urban centres is catching on fast, accelerated by concerns over air pollution and the climate emergency. Brighton is the latest city to propose a zone where private car journeys are banned. Among others, York is considering barring cars within its medieval walls Bristol will exclude diesel cars from a central area between 7am and 3pm Birmingham is developing a plan to stop people driving through the city centre and Cardiff wants to introduce a congestion charge.London brought in such a fee 17 years ago. “The congestion charge sealed the deal … but traffic wardens, bus lanes and double-yellow lines were a gradual deterrent before that,” says the transport historian Christian Wolmar. In the late 60s and 70s, a young Wolmar would drive his Austin 1100 from Kensington and park off Oxford Street or Pall Mall, to go to John Lewis in the day or the cinema by night as a child, he would sometimes accompany his father when he drove into town to work near Berkeley Square. “I don’t think I ever saw him on a bus.”However, Wolmar says the experience was “pretty nightmarish”: “There was no ‘golden age’ when there was no traffic. I could spend half an hour around Marble Arch. The last time I drove into central London was in the 90s, to go to a Chinese restaurant. That culture of being able to drive and park wherever you like no longer exists.”According to Peter Ackroyd’s book London: The Biography, vehicles in the city moved at approximately 12mph in late Victorian times, before mass car ownership, when the streets were “filled with the ceaseless incessant stream of horse-drawn, motor-driven and steam-propelled traffic”. By 2018, the average speed on A roads in the City and Westminster was about 8mph. So why is traffic moving more slowly than ever?Among most analysts, there is consensus on two underlying reasons: more vans and more Ubers. But in case we should feel righteously smug, Travers adds a list of contributors to the gridlock: “Cycle lanes, in some places, are bad. Ubiquitous four-way pedestrian crossing. Wider pavements. Any one of those makes perfect sense inidually. But the buses are completely screwed.”The bus easily outstrips the tube and rail as the main mode of transport for Londoners – even more so among disabled people, those with mobility problems and the poorest residents. Frozen prices, plus the introduction in 2016 of the hopper fare, which allows unlimited journeys within one hour for the cost of one trip, have made buses even cheaper under the current mayor, Sadiq Khan. However, the network has shrunk and patronage has declined in the past four years.About a quarter of London buses are run by the Go-Ahead Group. David Brown, its chief executive, says: “London lost a lot of passengers in 2015-16 because the speed of my number 11 bus was 4mph. You could walk faster than that. Increasing congestion is the biggest problem we face. Congestion has such a negative impact. Air quality worsens. The slower buses go, the more people get out of them and get into the car, and the slower it will go. All you get is more traffic idling, belching out fumes.”Figures from the Department for Transport show that traffic speeds have declined across Britain over the past decade, particularly in urban areas. Recovery from the financial crisis, plus cheap credit deals, has meant more cars on the road.Tackling that is a headache, as Brown knows. In a previous job at TfL, he tried to curb the numbers of delivery vehicles coming into London before the Olympics, when fears of gridlock were at their height. “I was looking at Amazon, then I realised there were a hundred and one people delivering to my own building every second. Just trying to get 11 floors and 2,500 people working for TfL to change their behaviour was hard enough.”Some of these deliveries were personal items others were the result of various departments ordering their own photocopying paper, which arrived at different floors at different times. TfL had some success consolidating these trips, “but it was really hard yards, down in the detail”. Meanwhile, Brown says, “Regent Street had 36 different operators doing recycling. Each person was doing the right thing, but add them all up together …”The boom in urban construction – most visibly the spate of skyscrapers in the Square Mile – has also been a factor. “They generate trips,” says Calderato. “There’s a lot of road space needed for the construction traffic.” Adjacent roads can be ripped up to ert utilities, creating more roadworks. Once these buildings are built, the lifts need to be maintained, the offices need to be serviced – and, of course, there will be many deliveries.If Amazon and co is one villain of congestion, another is Uber and its imitators. After the ride-hailing app reached London in 2013, the number of licensed private-hire vehicles surged, from 49,800 to 87,400 by 2017.Uber says it is committed to reducing inidual car ownership and points out it has recently integrated public transport information into its app. Its car-pooling option is used by 350,000 Londoners, which a spokesman said saved 1.7m miles driven last year.McNamara points to a junction on the edge of the congestion zone, opposite St Pancras station. “Camden make the decision to close the top of Judd St. As a result of stopping that infinitesimal bit of traffic, the traffic lights can’t cope with the right turn vehicles now have to make. People come two hours whizzing on the Eurostar from Paris and spend 40 minutes waiting to cross the Euston Road in a taxi.”Traffic is monitored from TfL’s Palestra building in Southwark and controlled, to some extent, through an automated system known as Scoot, which adapts the signals on key roads and junctions. A 10-year, multimillion-pound contract for an upgrade, Future Scoot, was given to Siemens in 2018. TfL claims it will maximise road space McNamara is unconvinced. “They place too much emphasis on Scoot, which was a panacea and going to solve all our problems, but hasn’t,” he says. “The borough is doing one thing, the mayor is doing something else and it all crumbles around us.”Cycle lanes are also an uncomfortable topic. The construction of cycle superhighways in 2015 and 2016, in particular, coincided with buses almost grinding to a halt. While Brown backs cycling, he says: “In the end, you’ve taken road space away from buses. We’ve accommodated.”McNamara is less restrained. “We’re being polluted because nothing is moving,” he says. “That’s why no one is getting on buses now – it’s quicker to walk. Then they say the answer is to build more cycle lanes. No!” For McNamara, there is a clear class dimension to the debate: “The myth of the anti-car lobby is that it’s someone in a Rolls-Royce flicking cigar ash out of the window at the cyclists. It’s the working class that are driving the commercial vehicles in central London, and they are being forced out by the wealthy inner-London elite, who can afford to live in Islington and want to ride their bike to St Pancras. They want to sit in Oxford Circus and drink their skinny caramel coconut latte without any thought about how the constituent parts got there. And they want something, they buy it on their phone and they expect it delivered the next day.”But then, as Travers says: “The truth is that almost everyone using the streets – cabs, buses, pedestrians and cyclists – has a sense of entitlement.”But perhaps the ambition to eradicate congestion is doomed. “London has very limited street space, and a lot of demand for that space,” says Calderato. However, Ollie More, a policy officer at the sustainable transport charity Sustrans, argues that being a non-driver doesn’t exclude people like him from the pain of traffic – be it on a slow bus or while cycling to work. “I go a long, convoluted route to be safe, so it takes a long time. We all feel it the same.”He says that, of the 6.8m private vehicle trips made daily in Greater London, 4.2m could be walked or cycled. Meanwhile, Manchester has unveiled plans for a walking and cycling network to outstrip London’s – a 1,800-mile protected space for active journeys in a city where one-third of car trips cover a distance shorter than 1km.One day, the concept of vehicle congestion may feel outmoded. “In terms of reducing congestion and using space efficiently, walking is the best mode of transport,” More says. “Cycling is five times more efficient at moving people than a standard traffic lane. With the health benefits, tackling the climate emergency and air pollution challenges, it’s ticking multiple boxes. We need a culture shift.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4846e73088f977dbc4a8b9e4e839eb74b2b01bc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dba4eb9a7d4e63f486b661a457466e","title":"i finally had control it was my account starting over again in emergency accommodation","story":"For a woman staying in refuge, sorting out a new bank account is made all the more difficult when you can’t reveal the addressI suffered domestic abuse for several years when I was with my husband.

Then in the final appointment they said the manager had now refused because I didn’t have an address. I was so upset and frustrated. It was like I didn’t matter, nobody cared. It was humiliating and again I had no control. I was worried how I would manage without the universal credit money. I had to feed my children.

The use of a short audio loop taken from his much-loved Four Seasons concerto as the much-hated hold music for the Department for Work and Pensions’ helplines, has not been great, reputationally, for him or the DWP. As the protesting benefit claimant Daniel Blake in Ken Loach’s eponymous film, ground down by hunger, desperation and interminable unproductive calls to DWP call centres spray paints on to the walls of his local jobcentre: “... And change the shite music on the phones!“The DWP has now, thankfully, changed the helpline music – after 14 years and lots of complaints. But this was never about the music itself, rather its misuse. Replacing Vivaldi was a relatively tiny policy change in the great scheme of DWP things, but it nonetheless provides an interesting case study, offering wider lessons for anyone interested in how government works: why did the DWP get it wrong in the first place? Why was it resistant to putting things right when people complained? And how was it finally persuaded to change its mind?Choosing the Spring section of Four Seasons as hold music in 2006 must have seemed a no-brainer. The music is lovely, is it not? The opening movements are so regal, strident, impressive. What could be more perfectly redolent of a great British institution like the DWP than a constant 30-second loop projecting timeless grandeur and authority? Plus it was free, thanks to a licensing agreement. Fair enough, up to a point. That no one was thinking about the people who had to listen to the loop for long periods did not seem to be an issue at the time. When users of the helplines started to complain that the experience was aural torture, however, nothing happened. Simply reporting to your DWP call-centre operative that half an hour of repetitive Vivaldi loops caused you to feel tense and anxious got you nowhere. The complaint might be passed on, but it would get lost in the system. If it got through, policy managers would shrug it off as “anecdotal opinion”. We know what we are doing, was the implicit message. And anyway, how could our “customers” not like this lovely music?The breakthrough came from outside the DWP. Through its hosting of the Office for Disability Issues (which has since moved to the Cabinet Office), the department was involved in cross-government discussions on autism policy. Crucially, these meetings involved ordinary people with autism. This led to the reframing of the Vivaldi problem as an issue of the health of autistic benefit claimants, and their right to positively access public services.A DWP-commissioned report by one of those lived-experience experts proved why long exposure to the Vivaldi loops could be toxic to people on the autism spectrum. Loud, repetitive chunks of music could overstimulate and create sensory overload, resulting in pain and disorientation. Fears of not having the call answered at all were heightened. Some callers were so traumatised by 40 minutes on hold that when they finally got through they were unable to properly explain why they had rung in the first place – and the call was terminated.Callers now get a 20-minute repetition-free blend of tracks that promise a “steady, neutral pace”. The new on-hold music aspires, in the words of an internal DWP report, to ensure the caller no longer feels the DWP is ”simply trying to make them go away”. Not everyone is convinced that the problem has been solved. The spoken prompts – such as those that encourage waiting callers to hang up and get in touch online, when it is often online failure that has triggered the call in the first place – are said to be especially aggravating.It is to the DWP’s credit, however, that it finally listened to its “customers” and acted on what it heard. What wider lessons might it learn? Find ways to listen to more people with experience of the system, including your frontline staff. Be open to change. Don’t assume you have all the answers. And make the DWP a health organisation rather than just a job-finder agency and  of the cash dispenser: using the benefits system should not make you ill or, if you are unwell to start with, even worse.• Patrick Butler is the ’s social policy editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/035694e1bdb8ab8e8f48d7f0d3c3f2c2105261e6/0_58_4992_2998/master/4992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01c88e0e7e678a781be3bb3aa1d48302","title":"revealed beautician procedures leaving customers burned and scarred","story":"Dozens of people a month are complaining about botched mole and skin lesion removalsRogue beauticians are leaving customers burnt and scarred when removing moles and lesions, as well as missing potential signs of skin cancer, in a trend that has prompted serious concerns from doctors.Dozens of patients a month are complaining about their treatment by beauty therapists, hairdressers and nail technicians who have removed blemishes from their skin, the  can reveal. With the NHS rarely performing cosmetic procedures for aesthetic reasons, there are concerns that staff with no medical training are instead performing potentially dangerous, invasive procedures.“Innocuous-looking moles can be cancerous, and without the correct diagnosis, skin cancers can be missed,” said Tijion Esho, a leading cosmetic doctor in London’s Harley Street. “The situation is horrific.”Safety in Beauty, a campaign group that aims to expose bad practice in the industry, reports that over the last year it has gone from receiving only occasional complaints about mole removals to getting five a day. People are recounting how they have been burned, scarred and given infections including MRSA, and telling of beauticians interfering with growths that turn out to be signs of skin cancer.Save Face, a government-approved voluntary register of accredited cosmetic practitioners, has also recorded an increase in complaints from eight in 2016 to 57 in 2018, and the figures for 2019 are predicted to show a surge.However, cosmetic doctors say the real number of people harmed may be greater because many of those affected are too embarrassed to speak up about their experience.Esho has seen a growing number of people coming into his practice after botched mole removals. “Many of them don’t realise at the time they’ve been treated incorrectly,” he said, adding that the consequences of mistreatment can take time to emerge.Emma Rose (not her real name) was having her hair cut in east London in 2017 when the hairdresser spotted a mole on her cheek and suggested she have it removed by a beautician from Beauty Box By Maggie. The following week Rose had her mole “dermaplaned” in an unregulated procedure, now commonplace on the high street, where the growth is shaved off with a blade.Rose alleges: “The beautician said to me: ‘Loads of people have moles like this. A scar wouldn’t even be left.’ She said that loads of doctors send people with moles to her as they are easy to do and most doctors are too busy to do them. She scraped part of it off and said the rest would naturally crust over and fall off. It did look better so I thought it had gone well.”Three months later Rose visited Esho privately for a separate aesthetic procedure and he asked her about the mole remains on her face. She had the rest of the mole removed in an NHS hospital in London, where she learned that she had squamous cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer.“I felt so stupid as the doctor said the beautician should never have touched it and the cancer could have spread with the wrong diagnosis and treatment,” he said. “I still can’t believe there are people who are doing medical treatments and convincing you it’s a simple beauty procedure. They are playing with people’s lives.“This could have cost her her life. The mole was not diagnosed, removed correctly or sent for pathology.”Beauty Box By Maggie, based in Havering in east London, continues to advertise mole removal online for £100 on Facebook and Instagram, and recently offered it at a discounted Christmas price of just £60. Invasive facelifts are carried out at the salon during which anaesthetic is injected and needles are inserted into the face. To perform such procedures, a special licence is required. However, Havering council says the clinic does not have one. The council said it was investigating and could prosecute the business or even force it to close for trading without the correct licence.Beauty Box By Maggie did not respond to questions put to it by the .The rise of complaints about mole removals and other procedures has prompted fresh concerns about the lack of proper regulation of the beauty industry, which is estimated to be worth £30bn a year to the UK economy. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the number of beauty salons and hairdressers in the UK rose from 25,375 in 2010 to 43,500 last year.The government only regulates cosmetic surgery carried out by a healthcare professional that involves instruments or equipment being inserted into the body, so many procedures slip between the cracks.Customers are being lured in by adverts for quick and cheap mole removals that have proliferated on social media. For example, the discount website Groupon regularly hosts promotions from places offering deals such as three removals for the price of two.Among the most common practices are dermaplaning laser therapy, which uses light to break down the pigment of moles and cryotherapy, where the growth is frozen off. Doctors have voiced particular unease about beauticians using plasma pens to remove moles by burning them, which can lead to infections, burns and scarring. They also fear that destroying the mole by any of these methods means it cannot be sent for examination by a pathologist, so the opportunity to diagnose skin cancer can be missed. Constance Campion, a consultant nurse practitioner in medical aesthetics who works at the Bupa Cromwell hospital in London, said the proliferation of procedures being performed without medical qualifications was putting the public at risk. “There are iniduals in the industry of skin today who have extended the scope of their work without the education, without the training, without the knowledge, without the professional competence, and the public is seriously at risk.”Dr Bav Shergill, a consultant dermatologist at an NHS hospital in Sussex and spokesman for the British Association of Dermatologists, said one reason for the rise was that the health service was performing fewer cosmetic procedures: “It’s pushing patients to try and find alternative providers of help.” A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “We urge anyone seeking a cosmetic procedure to take the time to find a reputable, safe and qualified practitioner. Consumers can seek advice from an appropriate medical practitioner such as a GP or mental health professional, as well as booking consultations with cosmetic practitioners.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daf27e91a31daaa290ddad890cc3b5e68cedd66e/0_100_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff7fa140a0881211cddfc6ecef0171e7","title":"uk time limit storing frozen eggs sperm could be extended public consultation","story":"The limit on how long frozen eggs, sperm and embryos can be stored may be extended amid concerns that women are being disproportionately affected, the government has announced.The maximum storage period is 10 years, after which families must decide whether to undergo fertility treatment or have their eggs, sperm and embryos destroyed. The Department of Health and Social Care is launching a public consultation into whether this should be changed.Currently, only eggs stored for medical reasons, such as cancer treatments and premature infertility, can be preserved for longer – up to 55 years in total.Both men and women may freeze their sperm andor eggs for non-medical reasons, such as wanting to have children in future. But concerns are growing that the 10-year storage limit for non-medical reasons is disproportionately affecting women who want to freeze their eggs.Caroline Dinenage, the minister for social care, said: “Every person should be given the best possible opportunity to start a family, which is why it is so important that our laws reflect the latest in technological advancements.“Although this could affect any one of us, I am particularly concerned by the impact of the current law on women’s reproductive choices. A time limit can often mean women are faced with the heartbreaking decision to destroy their frozen eggs, or feel pressured to have a child before they are ready.“As the number of people seeking this storage rises, we want to hear from the public about whether the law is fair and proportionate, and ensure everyone is empowered to choose when they become parents.”A woman has a better chance of a healthy pregnancy if she freezes her eggs in her 20s, when her fertility is at its peak. If she does so, the 10-year limit would then expire in her 30s, which may be too early for some women to start a family. The most common age for women to freeze their eggs in the UK is 38.The government will also consider issues of safety and quality, and additional demand for storage facilities, should the limit be extended.Sally Cheshire, chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, said: “As the fertility regulator, we have heard the voices of patients and clinicians calling for a review and extension of the current time limit for egg, embryo and sperm storage.“While any change to the 10-year storage limit would be a matter for parliament as it requires a change in law, we believe the time is right to consider what a more appropriate storage limit could be that recognises both changes in science and in the way women are considering their fertility.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6e86c0a995605b560414527e77404149eba503f/0_84_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c895201ee6d270bdf4aa276a79413b84","title":"have you been affected by changes to disability welfare payments","story":"We’d like you to help us document how problems with welfare benefits have affected people with disabilities.

At least he looked suitably sheepish about it – pointedly ignoring the sharp whispers, the discreet pointing, the gentle ribbing from his running club mates. With its clownish platform heels and lurid alien colour scheme, the Vaporfly is not a shoe for blending into the crowd. Even in a field of 600 anonymous runners the eye is always going to be drawn to the one wearing what looks like a mutant tropical fish on each foot. The race began and off he streaked: a blur of lime-green disappearing into the distance, leaving the rest of us, with our boring reasonably-priced shoes and sniggering moral judgments, in his dust.Of course, it’s easy to scoff when the stakes are minuscule. Turning up for your local Saturday morning fun run in £250 space-age trainers: objectively very funny, and largely analogous to the guy who wears his Lionel Messi astro boots to Wednesday five-a-side (and leaves with several painful stud-shaped indentations in his ankle). What happens, though, when the stakes are far higher? When the prize is an Olympic gold medal, when the audience is global, when the margins are life-changing? Should it matter what shoes the competitors are wearing? And if not, why not?These are some of the questions with which athletics has been grappling in recent months. In a way they go well beyond the optimum thickness of a nitrogen-infused midsole or whether two carbon plates should be allowed to overlap. No question of sporting ethics can be resolved purely through science and, by the same token, the terms of our emotional engagement are far too important to be dictated by administrators bearing formulae. The question of the Nike Vaporflys – and its successor models – is thus one that cuts to the very core of what sport is about, or should be.By now readers will be aware of how Vaporfly-shod athletes have been laying waste to the record books, quietly and quickly changing the face of the sport. Eight of the 12 fastest men’s or women’s marathons in history have been run in the last 18 months. In October, in Vienna, Eliud Kipchoge became the first man to run the marathon distance in under two hours. The prototype Alphafly shoes he wore for that effort are banned but last month World Athletics retroactively declared the Vaporflys legal as well as the records set in them.The first point to make here – although in the scale of things, not a terrifically helpful one – is that Nike have done nothing illegal or even that novel. Carbon plates date back to the early 2000s, with Paul Tergat breaking the marathon world record in a pair of Filas in 2003. Nor is there much new in the deployment of energy-efficient foam, which Adidas first pioneered almost a decade ago. Nike’s stroke of insight has been to synthesise largely existent technologies into a single devastating package, one that with the backing of World Athletics has in effect rewritten the terms of distance running. Either you join the arms race (if, that is, you can negotiate Nike’s imperial battalion of patent lawyers). Or you lose.You don’t have to be a luddite or a nostalgic to wonder about where this vision of athletics might ultimately lead. For those at the vanguard of the revolution these are genuinely transformative times – a chance to rebrand athletics as a high-powered, jaw-dropping spectator entertainment. When Kipchoge states, with all the evangelical zeal of a tech bro in a headset giving a Ted talk, that “we must go with technology” and compares Nike’s trainer innovation with the role of tyre manufacturers in Formula One, he is articulating an entirely different sort of sport from the one we grew up with: one in which the turning wheel of technological progress is not merely an auxiliary sideshow but part of the spectacle itself.The main gripe here is not driven by ideology or anti-progress. We are not talking about returning to cinder tracks and putting everyone in Dunlop Green Flash. Nor is it the increasingly corrosive influence of Nike on athletics, an entire sport now in effect in thrall to a single company nor the inevitable human wastage of athletes physiologically unsuited to the new technology or sponsored by companies unable to replicate it or simply unable to afford it nor even the colossal environmental dereliction of a shoe that has to be thrown away after 200 miles of use.No, the real point is this: in the same way that nobody reads novels to marvel at the typeface, nobody watches athletics – in many ways the oldest and purest sport of all – to gawp at the trainers. Do you know how many butt-numbingly boring articles about shoe technology I had to read before I could start writing this column? Even its very existence feels like the triumph of the inane over the essential, a lame surrender to the Nike marketing octopus. (Woman in Nike’s PR department, reading Vaporfly’s press coverage: “Oh, no. Another article criticising our shoes for being too fast. How utterly terrible.”)But then, if you’re a sport in 2020 and not somehow facilitating disposable parasite-consumerism, then do you even really exist? Perhaps once, long ago, before we were terminally jaded by doping scandals, we could still cling to the idea that athletics somehow represented the very best of us as a species that its feats might inspire us, rather than simply inspire us to buy trainers that this was genuinely a sport operating by the laws of the body, not the laws of the market. Or perhaps this too was always delusion: a lime-green speck on the horizon, gently receding ever further into the distance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fff1e88b145ae424bd4e2519cbb817f0d7ea168/0_63_4400_2640/master/4400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d624d66b43cd77127644df3c7c8ef99","title":"jurgen klinsmann resigns as hertha berlin manager after 10 weeks","story":"Jürgen Klinsmann has resigned as the Hertha Berlin coach after only 10 weeks in charge, citing a lack of support and trust.The former World Cup winner replaced Ante Covic as head coach in late November with Hertha lying in the Bundesliga’s relegation zone.“We were on a good path and despite difficult games had moved six points away from the relegation spots.

As joint capital of culture it has a huge programme of events – along with existing festivals. Cúirt is an Old Irish word for a court of poetry, and the name of a week-long festival of literature (20-25 April) that Seamus Heaney, Edna O’Brien and Allen Ginsberg have appeared at in the past. Galway Arts Festival in July (13-26) feels to me like it involves everyone in the city. Baboró is an inspiring festival for children and there’s also the Galway Races (not just about the horses) and the celebration of a local delicacy at our Oyster Festival (25-27 September).There are two very different walks starting from Wolfe Tone Bridge. First, wander south past the Claddagh district and out along Nimmo’s Pier and by the seashore, until you see the Promenade on the right, built in the mid-19th century but gradually extended since. Here, you’ll meet walkers, joggers, strollers, crawlers and more – all taking in the sea air and ever-changing colour and light that is Galway Bay. It’s about three miles long and one of the glories of Galway. The second walk follows the canal north to University College, heads into the grounds through the entrance and, at Bailey Allen Hall, turns right to the river. Follow the riverbank for a couple of miles to Dangan, opposite the ruins of Menlo Castle. This gives you a different sense of Galway’s character but for me, having grown up by the sea, the Prom is the one.Whiskey drinkers go to Garavan’s in William Street or Sonny Molloy’s in High Street as both have a remarkable array of labels to sample. Freeney’s, also in High Street, the Hyde Bar in Forster Street and Tigh Nora in Cross Street all carry great gins (and tonic). In pubs, the emphasis is on traditional music and the Crane Bar on Sea Road is the one for purists. A great way to experience the atmosphere on the streets is to sit outside Tigh Neachtain, another classic pub, with a drink and watch the world go by. I’ve experience of all of these establishments but I’m mature and grey and like good pub talk, so particularly recommend the Bunch of Grapes in High Street and Lonergans in Salthill (no websites). There’s now a small distillery, Micil, making poitín in the Oslo Bar in Salthill: it does tours and tastings Tues-Sat at 2pm, 4pm and 6pm.Macnas is an Old Irish word that means “the energy of a young calf leaping around the meadow in the springtime”. It’s also the name of a Galway theatre group that specialises in outdoor spectacle. A macnas parade is a riot of imagination, colour, enthusiasm, music, throbbing drums, fire, dance and mayhem. An air of abandon infects most of the population during these events it’s as if a spell spreads over Galway and makes everybody happy for the day. Its 2020 programme is built around the epic of Gilgamesh.• Events 10-12 April, 21 June, 19-28 November, 12 December, macnasA taste of Galway has to start with the oysters it’s famous for (available when there’s an R in the month). Pacific oysters can’t match our local ones: I’m partial to those from Cooke’s restaurant in Abbeygate Street and Kasbah, a wine bar that is next to its parent pub Tigh Neachtain. Family butcher Colleran’s has been serving Galwegians since 1935 and its black pudding is also a local delicacy, while Sheridan’s Cheesemongers on Churchyard Street is an occasion of sin for anyone interested in (local, Irish and international) cheese. For food and views, Ard Bia by the Spanish Arch looks out on the river, and the sea, and has an emphasis on seafood. Corrib House Tea Rooms has spectacular views from the river bank at Waterside, and has a terrific array of teas plus B\u0026ampB accommodation (doubles from €120). Kai on Sea Road was once the tuck shop for the school next door but has been turned into a restaurant with a focus on organic, and wild, locally sourced ingredients.This church was founded in 1320, making it 700 years old this year – which is excellent birthday timing. It’s a must-visit because it offers a microcosm of the history of the city: it was built by the Knights Templar, supported by the Tribes of Galway (14 leading merchant families), and has been visited by Christopher Columbus, Oliver Cromwell’s troops, lepers, famine victims and countless worshippers over the years. It has alternated between Catholic and Protestant and, while today it’s in the care of the Church of Ireland, it really is an ecumenical building. Every Saturday, there’s a lively market outside.• stnicholas.ieIf you like independent bookshops to be a seductive maze of rooms, search out Charlie Bryne’s Bookshop on Middle Street. Inside its labyrinth are more than 100,000 books (new, secondhand, antiquarian) but the staff know their stuff, so can help navigate. It’s no surprise it was voted Irish bookshop of the year in 2019. You’re likely to bump into a visiting author there, just as you are at my place, Kennys. Bell Book and Candle in the Small Crane Square has an eclectic collection of books, comics, music and posters and is a fun place to visit.This is a series of more than 20 poems and pieces of writing about Galway engraved on plaques around the city. The bookshop I help run set it up, in conjunction with Galway City Council, and each plaque – in bronze or stone – is in a place that reflects its content. There are words by James Joyce, Seamus Heaney, Moya Cannon, Máire Holmes, Roger McGough and more, and each offers quiet contemplation to lift the soul in an urban environment. They’re happy surprises when you come across them.• Details at kennys.ie, while a trail map is available from Galway tourist office on Forster StreetThe 34,000-seat Pearse Stadium in Salthill gives you the chance to see the action-packed – and uniquely Irish – sporting spectacles of hurling and Gaelic football. I think hurling’s one of the fastest stick games in the world, but though the sticks look like weapons they’re rarely used as such: it’s a highly skilled game with wonderful hand-eye co-ordination. If you prefer rugby, the Sportsground on College Road, a five-minute walk from the city centre, is the home of Connacht Rugby. Try for a spot on the Clan Terrace for the best atmosphere.• galwaygaa.ieThe Claddagh was a fishing village at the spot where the Corrib enters the sea, with cobbled streets, mud-walled houses and an independent spirit – with its own laws and king. In the late 1920s, medical officers declared it unhealthy and it was demolished and replaced by concrete houses. The village also had its own style of wedding ring and a tradition of handing them down from mother to daughter. It’s worn with the crown towards the knuckle while single and, after marriage, with the crown towards the nail. Legend claims that Richard Joyce, a Galwayman, was captured by Algerian corsairs and sold as a slave to a Moorish goldsmith who trained him in jewellery making. In 1689 he was freed and returned to Galway to set up his own business. Some of the earliest known Claddagh rings are believed to be his. There is more about rings and legends at the Claddagh Ring visitor centre on Shop Street in the city centre.• claddaghlegendWhere to stayBuilt in 1852, The Hardiman (doubles from €115 B\u0026ampB) is a grand property (originally called the Railway Hotel) that was refurbished in 2019. It is in the city centre, overlooking Eyre Square. The Harbour Hotel (doubles from €108 B\u0026ampB) serves up a waterfront stay that’s a short walk from the city centre and a 10-minute stroll to Salthill promenade.Tom Kenny is a director of Kennys Bookshop and Art GalleryLooking for a holiday with a difference?

And still nationally, I’m still leading in all polls that I’m aware of, number one. Number two, the endorsements keep coming in.”Amy Klobuchar is also hoping to do well in New Hampshire, after a strong debate performance on Friday. “There’s a bunch of people coming out, committing, that had been supporting other candidates,” the centrist senator from Minnesota told reporters on Sunday. “It’s all over the place. It’s really strange. I wish I had videos of it.”Michael Bloomberg may not be running in today’s New Hampshire primary, but he might end up being one of its major beneficiaries.The former New York mayor is taking a radical approach to the primaries, ignoring the first four and only entering the race on Super Tuesday. With that in mind, he has been blanketing California and other large states with advertising, spending hundreds of millions of dollars from his multi-billion-dollar fortune. Bernie Sanders in particular has been outraged at this strategy, accusing the centrist former mayor of trying to “buy the presidency”. Sanders has also hit out at the Democratic National Committee for changing its rules regarding who qualifies to take part in debates – a move widely seen as paving the way for Bloomberg to take the stage for the first time. The reason Bloomberg – who is running on a platform of gun control, an expansion of Medicare health coverage, and a less radical climate-change policy than some of his rivals – has not qualified for debates so far is because the old rules required candidates to have taken in a certain amount in donations, and the billionaire Bloomberg is funding his campaign himself. The former mayor’s defence is basically that needs must. “Someone said: ‘Are you spending too much money?’ and I said: ‘I’m spending money to get rid of Donald Trump,’” he said recently. “And the guy said: ‘Spend more.’”Not only has Biden’s strength with African Americans been seen as one of the pillars of his claim to electability so far, but Bloomberg was seen to have a major potential problem with many black voters. While he was weighing up whether to run, he apologised for the police “stop and frisk” tactic he pushed in New York that disproportionately targetted black and Latino people. “I was wrong, and I am sorry,” he said. The new polling figures suggest some black voters are willing to consider him despite the controversy. If Biden’s candidacy implodes, he, Pete Buttigieg and to a lesser extent Amy Klobuchar will try to make the case to centrist Democrats that they can beat Bernie Sanders and then Donald Trump.But Bloomberg has a long way to go on Super Tuesday – he is still polling in single figures in California and Texas, for example, despite all his spending. Good morning and welcome to the ’s live blog as voters in New Hampshire go to the polls in the second primary contest of the 2020 election.Results are already coming in, with three minuscule towns – Dixville Notch, Hart’s Location and Millsfield – voting, as they traditionally do, just after midnight. Those results – showing Amy Klobuchar leading the Democratic pack with a total of eight votes – may not be a good prediction of the final tally, although it’s true the centrist Minnesota senator was praised for her debate performance on Friday night. In fact the race for the top spot tonight is widely seen as being between leftwing senator Bernie Sanders and the centrist former mayor Pete Buttigieg. The latest polling averages show Sanders with a comfortable lead over his young rival, after the two essentially tied for first place amid the shambolic caucuses in Iowa last week.“For two people in the same party, Buttigieg and Bernie are polar opposites in many ways,” Monica Klein, a progressive Democratic strategist, told my colleague Daniel Strauss. “They represent the two wings of the Democratic party – which makes Buttigieg a great contrast candidate for Bernie.”Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire – which borders his home state of Vermont – by over 22 percentage points in 2016, and if he loses to Buttigieg tonight after his frustrating night in Iowa it may indicate his campaign is stalling. While Iowa traditionally holds the first caucuses in the presidential election, New Hampshire has held the first primary since 1920.\u0026nbspThe goal for presidential candidates is to win early-voting states and create name recognition and a sense of momentum, as well to pick up their first delegates, who will eventually choose the nominee in summer.Sometimes a clear favorite for the nomination emerges quickly, but the last two major Democratic primary contests, pitting Barack Obama against Hillary Clinton and then Bernie Sanders against Clinton, have lasted from the Iowa caucuses in January through to late spring.Buttigieg, meanwhile, needs a win to keep his momentum going after his unexpectedly strong showing last week – it still hasn’t been formally declared a victory by results gurus AP – and a bump in his poll ratings in New Hampshire and (slightly) nationally. From here the contest enters much tougher territory for him. Nevada on 22 February looks like a close fight between Sanders and Joe Biden, and Barack Obama’s former vice-president is still way ahead in South Carolina. Biden has seen his frontrunner status more or less disappear since his fourth-place finish in Iowa. Sanders is now neck and neck with him nationally, and a similarly weak showing in New Hampshire tonight may see him lose further centrist support to Buttigieg and ex-New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, the dark horse who joins the race on “Super Tuesday”, 3 March, when numerous states including California, Texas and Massachusetts all vote. Adam Gabbatt examines Biden’s New Hampshire campaign here. Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren – Sanders’ main rival on the left – may also start to see her campaign slipping away if she fails to make an impact tonight.The Republicans are also holding a primary today, although there is only one serious candidate. Donald Trump held a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, last night which aimed more to rattle his Democratic opponents than the relative small fry running against him in his own party. As Lauren Gambino reports, Trump attacked “the outrageous partisan impeachment hoax”, revelled in the Democrats’ muddled result in Iowa, and raised the prospect of his supporters influencing the Democratic result in New Hampshire by voting for the candidate they believe Trump would have the best chance of defeating. New Hampshire election laws allow independents to cast ballots for either Democrats or Republicans. “My only problem is I’m trying to figure out who is the weakest candidate,” the president said. “I think they’re all weak.”The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and outlying territories, by which each party selects its presidential nominee.\u0026nbspThe goal for presidential candidates is to amass a majority of delegates, whose job it is to choose the nominee at the party’s national convention later in the year. In some states, delegates are awarded on a winner-take-all basis other states split their delegates proportionally among top winners.We’ll be covering all this and more here today, as well as news back in Washington as the House Republican leadership and the Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer both hold press conferences."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd5d320e39099d198d30f08e8ca3fdde7b0619dc/912_931_3451_2070/master/3451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef923c47e5ae0749693905094eda682b","title":"come back soon coronavirus wreaks havoc on global tourism hotspots","story":"Outbreak huge blow for Thailand, Japan and Italy, which rely heavily on Chinese visitorsMost February evenings, it’s a struggle to push through the crowds to get to Yanakawee Srialam’s souvenir stall in Bangkok’s Ratchada Train night market. It’s peak tourism season and the market’s alleyways would normally be heaving with visitors.But Chinese tourists, who make up the vast majority of Srialam’s usual customers, have all but disappeared. His best-selling items now include disposable face masks, which have surpassed sales of souvenirs such as pad Thai fridge magnets.China has stopped all outbound tour groups from leaving the country in a bid to halt the spread of coronavirus and encouraged citizens to reconsider travelling abroad. International airlines have suspended tens of thousands of trips to and from mainland China. For countries such as Thailand – whose tourism sector depends heavily on Chinese travellers – it’s a huge blow.Visitor numbers have plummeted, with hotel bookings and guided tours cancelled. On the resort island of Phuket, the professional guide association warned last week that 3,000 Chinese-speaking tour guides are out of work and need financial support.Last year, 11 million Chinese people visited Thailand– a number that is expected to fall by 2 million this year.The outbreak has wreaked havoc across the global tourism industry, which has become increasingly reliant on Chinese visitors. The number of Chinese people going abroad grew rapidly to 150 million in 2018, and operators have responded by designing packages specifically aimed at them.Italy’s national hotel association, Federalberghi, has said the country – the most popular destination for Chinese visitors to Europe, recording 3.5 million in 2019 – could lose billions of euros as Chinese tourists cancel hotel bookings amid a flight ban. Ignazio Visco, the chief of the Bank of Italy, has also warned that the coronavirus outbreak could seriously affect the country’s already weak economy.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised UK nationals to leave China where possible. It is also warning that travellers from Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand who develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath within 14 days of returning the UK should contact the NHS by phone.“A temporary ban on arrivals is manageable,” said Bernabò Bocca, the president of the Venice hotel association. “But if coronavirus discourages the Americans from travelling, it would mean trouble for Italy. The potential damage from a prolonged crisis could reach €4.5bn.”Meanwhile, thousands of people on a luxury cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, remain stuck in quarantine off the coast of Japan. Passengers have mostly been confined to their cabins to stop the spread of the virus, which has so far reportedly infected 136 people.The impact of the outbreak on the global tourism market is unknown, but it’s expected that Thailand, Japan and other nearby destinations will be among those hardest hit. Officials warn that an outbreak in one of Thailand’s tourist hotspots is possible.In Bangkok, anti-bacterial gels are offered in shops while one of the luxury malls has begun taking customers’ temperatures. Masks were already worn by many because of the heavy pollution, but have now become even more common. Thailand’s health minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, has previously said that “farang” tourists, a sometimes dismissive term for westerners, should be kicked out of the country if they do not wear a mask. At Ratchada market, Radek Slepowronski and Margaret Ciszkowska, from Poland, said they were taking precautions but were not overly concerned. “In crowded places, on planes, buses, we wear masks, we wash our hands, we disinfect them,” said Ciszkowska. “But we’re not scared about it,” added Slepowronski.For others, who have traveled from Japan, Hong Kong or who have not been able to return home to mainland China, Thailand feels a safe place to be. Anthony James, who is from the UK but lived for nine years in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, left the city to go travelling shortly before it was placed under lockdown. He has not experienced any symptoms.The handful of westerners visiting the market were little consolation to stallholders. “There are a few westerners coming, but westerners are not big spenders,” says Srialam. “It’s hard to make sales to them, they negotiate very strongly.” Chinese tourists, he says, are the most important for business.At Wongtaraloesakul’s food stall, a sign reads “jiāyóu China, jiāyóu Wuhan”, which translates literally as “add oil”, meaning “keep up the fight”. His message to China is to get well soon: “Come back soon. We are waiting.”Additional reporting by Angela Giuffrida in Rome"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/216ff0a2c6d4c17985d8561a34b36083a78c036f/187_0_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22051837e703fff02db9d27f25c98930","title":"could the coronavirus mutate if a vaccine cant be found in time","story":"As scientists race to trace out paths the virus might take we ask the crucial questionsIn just a month, the coronavirus outbreak has snowballed from a handful of cases to more than 40,000, reaching four continents and prompting an all-out battle to stop the spread across China and beyond. As those in Wuhan face shortages of hospital beds and supplies that have been likened to “wartime conditions”, experts and scientists are attempting to trace out the possible paths that the virus might take.When Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) hit in 2002, after an initial surge in cases, the epidemic fizzled out. However, many experts believe the chances of this happening with 2019-nCoV are looking increasingly slim. In fact, the odds may have been more difficult even from the start of the latest outbreak, according to David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). “Sars emerged in one or two people,” he said. “This current outbreak it seems was quite explosive at the start – it was many different people infected at the start, and they each set off their own chain of transmission.”Although the difference in initial case numbers may sound small – two people versus 16, say – in an epidemic where numbers of infections are doubling every five days that could have set back containment efforts by several weeks.It is too early to calculate how effective quarantines have been in containing the spread. A slight levelling off in the number of global cases over the past few days has been taken by some as a cause for optimism, although this may also reflect difficulties in recording cases.On Sunday, World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that cases of the coronavirus being transmitted by people who had never been to China could be “the tip of the iceberg”, while on Monday the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, declared the virus “a serious and imminent threat to public health” after four new cases were diagnosed in the country.“One has to be a little bit pessimistic at this stage,” said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at LSHTM. “There are a large number of cases in China, even though they’re putting in place these draconian measures to contain it. It’s looking increasingly likely that it will become well-established in China. The likelihood is then that it will leak to other countries.”“My pessimistic view at this stage is that it is likely to become quite widespread and will be around for some time.”Some coronaviruses are seasonal and so it is possible that the number of cases may begin to dampen down as spring comes. But if the virus is already widespread by that point, it does not necessarily mean it is gone for good – just like flu, coronavirus could rear its head again next winter, at which point it would be considered an endemic human disease.There are already four circulating coronaviruses (chances are you have had one – they cause about a quarter of common colds) that originally made the leap to humans from cows, bats and other animals.“Coronaviruses have established themselves before. We have four of them that cause common cold-like illness,” said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “There’s a very high chance that can be the fifth.”If the coronavirus is still circulating in a year, its impact could be lessened by a level of immunity in the population and, possibly, the availability of vaccine to protect health workers and those most vulnerable. “This is the situation where a vaccine will become relevant,” said Smith.Tests so far suggest that the coronavirus is relatively stable but as it is passed from human to human the virus will become more adapted as a human disease. This is not necessarily a bad thing, though. “In Darwinian terms, the virus wants to survive,” said Smith. “And to do that it’s generally not a sensible idea for a virus to kill people. The most successful viruses infect a lot of people and cause relatively little pathology.”It’s worth noting that coronaviruses do not undergo the same type of genome shuffling that leads to the constantly shifting variety of flu strains in circulation. It is this genetic drift that means new flu vaccines have to be created each year and that means getting the flu once does not mean you’ll be immune next time it comes around. The coronavirus is not expected to mutate this rapidly and so once a vaccine is here, it should continue to work far into the future.Teams around the world are racing to produce a vaccine, with some vaccine candidates already being tested in animals, just weeks after the coronavirus DNA sequence was released.Jeff Richardson of Inovio Pharmaceuticals, one of the teams backed by funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), said the team’s DNA-based vaccine is already being manufactured on a larger scale for human testing projected to start early summer. A team from the University of Queensland, also backed by Cepi, is already testing its vaccine in combination with a technology developed by GSK, which makes the immune system respond more strongly to vaccines, potentially lowering the dose required by a factor of four.Few people doubt that a viable vaccine will be in human testing by the summer. But these incremental trials, in which the numbers given the vaccine are ramped up from 20 to 200 and then thousands, will unavoidably take many months to ensure that the vaccine is safe and that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.The global vaccines community faced severe criticism after the Ebola epidemic, which killed 11,000 people, over the failure to deploy a vaccine quickly enough it took more than a year, despite a vaccine having been in development for a decade. This time things have moved more quickly. But some argue that there is still much more the world could do to prepare for infectious disease outside times of crisis.Seth Berkley, head of the vaccine alliance Gavi, said: “The hardest thing for me is that we live in a world where we want to prevent. We have nuclear submarines as the third line of defence. We spend a lot of money to be prepared. But this is an evolutionary certainty whereas nuclear war is not – and yet we spend a lot less on this type of prevention.“During the Ebola outbreak it was the Isis of infectious disease,” he added. “A few weeks after that people were like, ‘Ebola? Yesterday’s story.’ The question is, how do we get people to pay attention to this in peacetime?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/143aee3f2332eed2a756dc54d3a867aa34d1c271/0_67_5409_3245/master/5409.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ab301f109ba91e37bdfdcd557b8e14d","title":"what are super spreaders coronavirus","story":"About one in five people transmit infections to far more people than the majority doNot everybody is equal when it comes to the transmission of infectious diseases. In fact, it has been established for at least two decades that there is something called the 2080 rule – that a small core group of about one in five people transmit infections to far more people than the majority do.It seems so. The third British case, after the first two diagnosed in York, was a man in his 50s who contracted the coronavirus infection at a conference in Singapore. He then travelled to France where he stayed with his family in a ski chalet in the Alpine resort of Les Contamines-Montjoie. Five people who were in the chalet, including a boy of nine, have tested positive for coronavirus since the man came back to the UK on an easyJet flight and was diagnosed in Brighton. Another Briton who was on holiday in the chalet flew back to his home in Mallorca and was admitted to hospital in Palma. The chief medical officer said four more people had tested positive in England – all of whom were also on the skiing holiday in France.Among delegates to the Singapore conference was a man who flew in from Wuhan, China, who may himself have been a super-spreader. A number of others who were there and returned to other countries, in addition to the British man at the centre of the ski chalet cluster, are said to have fallen ill.There are a number of theories, but no definite answer. Some speculate that it is to do with the immune system of the super-spreader, which may not be good at suppressing the virus or alternatively may be so good that they do not feel symptoms themselves so carry on transmitting it to others. But it is likely to be caused by multiple factors, possibly including getting a higher dose of the virus in the first place or being infected with more than one pathogen. One thing seems certain – it is impossible to know who will be a super-spreader and who will not.Yes. Super-spreaders have been documented as far back as the early 1900s, when one woman infected 51 people with typhoid, even though she had no symptoms herself. More recently, one student at a high school in Finland infected 22 others with measles in 1998, even though eight of them had been vaccinated. Two people are thought to have infected 50 others with Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1995. In the 2002-03 Sars epidemic, most people were not very infectious, but a few super-spreaders in Singapore appear to have transmitted the virus to as many as 10 people each.The government says the measures, including powers to detain people in quarantine or in isolation, are in line with other countries and the risk to the UK remains “moderate”. But the cluster of cases emerging from the Singapore hotel followed by the French ski chalet and arriving in the UK will reinforce the ease with which any virus can travel the world via super-spreaders. There will be particular concern that people can be infected without any symptoms that would alert them or other people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28dd339bbe8be43a0ea25ff7808eeb3ec73451e0/44_0_4049_2430/master/4049.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b17fee09a865bb374ba7ec0c9a09013f","title":"india modi ruling party poised to lose delhi election after polarising campaign","story":"Anti-establishment AAP on course to win 57 seats after BJP played up anti-Muslim rhetoric India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata party is projected to suffer a major defeat in another key state election, after failing to win over voters in Delhi with a campaign that was one of its most  polarising yet.The anti-establishment Aam Aadmi party (AAP), which has governed the capital for the past five years, is on course to win 57 seats in the 70-seat assembly, after running on an agenda centred on anti-corruption, healthcare and education, which have hugely improved during its time in power.The BJP, meanwhile, will probably take just 13 seats after a campaign that played heavily on its Hindu nationalist agenda and fearmongering against the Muslim community. While that figure falls far below the number to take victory from AAP, it nonetheless made a dent into AAP’s majority in the assembly and will be a significant increase from the three seats it held previously.Much of AAP’s popularity is centred on its leader, Arvind Kejriwal, once a self-confessed anarchist and anti-corruption activist, who has been highly critical of the BJP government during his time as Delhi chief minister.Multiple AAP MPs celebrated the party’s predicted victory. “This is the victory of work over hatred,” said Amanatullah Khan, who was elected MP for Delhi’s Okhla constituency.It appears that Congress, India’s oldest party, which had ruled Delhi for 15 years until 2013, once again failed to win a single seat.The defeat constitutes another setback for the prime minister Narendra Modi’s party, which faces the worst unrest in more than four decades.The new citizenship law provides a path to citizenship for religious minorities who have immigrated into India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan before 31 December 2014. It explicitly lists Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians as being able to take advantage of the new provisions, excluding Muslims.\u0026nbspBesides stoking concern among Muslims, the proposed changes have also led to protests by residents unhappy about an influx of Hindus from Bangladesh, who stand to gain citizenship.While Modi was re-elected with a huge majority in May 2019 in the national elections, at state level the BJP has not fared so well and, since December 2018, it has lost power in five states: Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Jharkhand.While the Delhi polls are always among the most closely contested elections in India, determining who will control India’s capital city of over 20 million people, this year felt particularly heated due to the protests that have continued to rock Delhi and the rest of the country in response to Modi’s new citizenship law (CAA), which critics say is prejudicial to Muslims.In response, much of the focus of the BJP Delhi campaign was on the female-led protests in the Muslim-majority Delhi suburb of Shaheen Bagh against the CAA. In some of their most anti-Muslim rhetoric yet, senior BJP figures out on the campaign trail frequently referred to the women as “terrorists” and anti-nationals in an attempt to pitch the election as a battle for the “unity of India”. The BJP minister Giriraj Singh said Shaheen Bagh was a “breeding ground for suicide bombers”.The protests in Shaheen Bagh and beyond had put the BJP on the back foot for the first time, and a win in Delhi was seen as a crucial way to recapture the narrative in its favour and demonstrate wide support for CAA.The protests and clashes between police and demonstrators have continued. In Delhi on Monday night, students at the Muslim-majority Jamia Millia Islamia University were beaten with batons by police as they marched through the capital in protest against CAA, and there are reports the police released toxic gas to disperse the crowds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/940c4afb5abaaf9acf51e04cc00c5ba4e9a4cc73/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c40672bd0d78f8bb4f32f327f4971b7","title":"north koreas most senior defector to run for parliament in the south","story":"Thae Yong-ho was deputy ambassador at the North Korean embassy in London when he defected in 2016The most senior diplomat to have defected from North Korea will run for parliament in South Korea to “give hope” to tens of thousands of others who have fled the regime, media reports said on Tuesday.Thae Yong-ho was deputy ambassador at the North Korean embassy in London when he defected with his wife and two sons in August 2016, and has since become one of the regime’s most vocal critics.Thae, who was denounced as a traitor by North Korea, will run in the national assembly elections on 15 April for Liberty Korea, the country’s conservative main opposition party, officials said.“Thae is someone who risked his life for freedom,” Kim Hyong-o, a party official in charge of candidacies, told reporters. “As a person who understands the sorrow of the 10 million separated families, and as one of 25 million North Koreans, he could present a vision for peace.“His courage and decision will give hope to North Korean refugees and other South and North Korean people who want genuine unification.”If elected, Thae, 57, would become the second North Korean defector to win a seat in the national assembly. The first was Cho Myung-chul, who fled to the South in 1994 and represented a predecessor to Liberty Korea from 2012-16. Party officials said Thae was likely to campaign for a seat in a Seoul constituency.He sparked jubilation in South Korea, and anger in his former homeland, when he became one of very few senior North Korean officials to defect.The regime in Pyongyang denounced him as “human scum” and accused him of misusing government funds and other crimes.More than 30,000 North Koreans have defected to the South since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war, but most are people fleeing poverty in rural areas near the Chinese border.The most high-ranking North Korean to have defected is Hwang Jang-yop, once a senior official with ruling Workers’ party who once tutored Kim Jong-il, the country’s former leader and father of its current leader Kim Jong-un. Hwang died in 2010.Thae said soon after he arrived in Seoul that he couldn’t bear the thought of his children leading “miserable” lives in the North, adding that he had lost confidence in Kim Jong-un after the leader began executing officials and developing nuclear weapons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9809f5f26ed591ed3103416beeeaa87e154316d9/0_72_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfa1c71df84cd10f6af25ce67656e3f2","title":"people voted for change readers on the irish election result","story":"We asked those in Ireland to tell us what they think about the election result. Here’s what some of you saidAfter nearly a century of two-party centre ground politics people voted for change. Past coalition failures wiped out the Labour party, leaving only Sinn Féin as a left-wing alternative. In essence people want affordable housing and a better health service. Sinn Féin have been front and centre with these policies, which has led to their success. After long negotiations I expect an uneasy coalition will be formed between SF and FF. I don’t expect this arrangement to last and another election will be called within 12 months. I think SF will increase their seats next time round and be in a much stronger position to form a stable government. Ivor O’Sullivan, medical representative, County MeathIt’s a big two fingers to the two centre right parties who have dominated Irish politics for a long time. This election reflects a desperation on the part of the electorate for a left leaning government who value the people over corporate entities. The result is comparable to the US voting for Trump and therefore is a populist vote, however because SF will need to go into coalition with another political party it means that some of their left leaning policies, which scare many, in theory should be kept in check. It will be an interesting few daysweeks of negotiations. If the parties cannot agree I predict another general election in the next few weeks. Mark O’Leary, 43, IT security engineer, CorkI’m delighted. Sinn Féin had my second preference vote, and I’m so glad to see a left-wing party do so well in Ireland. I’m hopeful that we can get a left-wing government without Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, but I doubt that will happen until the next election. Still, it’s a historic day for Dublin. I think there’s a chance that Sinn Féin could form a government with every small left-wing party in Ireland, although it’s unlikely this time around because of numbers. My guess is that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will go into government together and that will lead to their mutually assured destruction. Martha Mary McKinney-Perry, 18, student, DublinWhile I would be pleased with a genuine leftward electoral shift, I am doubtful about the depth of Sinn Féin’s commitment to democracy. I am old enough to be very aware of how their history has been since 1970. I also distrust sudden shifts in public opinion that seem more fashionable than considered. I think Sinn Féin will end up being in government with Fianna Fáil, the Greens and the Social Democrats – possibly Labour. Paddy Bushe, poet, 71, WatervilleI’m glad to see the Fine Gael tide receding. If only it hadn’t been replaced with a Fianna Fáil wave instead. I wouldn’t vote for Sinn Féin because of those populating the party, but seeing a more left-leaning party gain some ground is a welcome sight. Not that change is the done thing around here. Fianna Fáil have been trying to build themselves as the paragons and arbiters of virtue these past years so it will interesting to see whether they join up with FG whom they have criticised for years, or SF. I see an FF+SF coalition as most likely as I think Fine Gael have had a long enough run for the other parties tastes. Ben, 20, student, WexfordI feel really conflicted. I’m delighted to see both FF \u0026amp FG plummeting and to see a definite swing to the left but not comfortable that the swing has been to Sinn Féin. I would have preferred it to have been a Green Social Democrats Labour breakthrough. I think SF+FF coalition with another smaller party or two is the most likely outcome. Interesting times ahead. This is ‘Senior Hurling’ now lads! Ellen, 47, bioscientist, DublinI am glad that there is change. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael do not work for people who are renting, those on the average industrial wage, the children who live in poverty, and those who are homeless. They have been in power for over 10 years and little progress has been made on these issues. This sea change, is from younger voters, who want a fairer Ireland. I hope that Sinn Fein’s election will herald an era of a more equal Ireland, in which every child gets a chance, every cancer patient gets free treatment and carbon is dealt with! I hope that a government with strong left wing and green priorities will be formed and effective policies on public housing will be implemented.

Micheál Martin’s party finished with 38 seats but because the Fianna Fáil speaker was re-elected without contest, both parties are in effect on the same number.If McDonald fails to create a coalition from an array of small parties and independent TDs (MPs) focus will turn to a possible pact between Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil.The ruling Fine Gael party finished with 35 seats, which means it will probably go into opposition. Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach and party leader, faced a call from Paudie Coffey, a former Fine Gael TD and junior minister, to quit as party leader.Simon Coveney, the party’s deputy leader, called the voters’ verdict “harsh” but backed Varadkar’s continued leadership. Another senior party figure, Paschal Donohoe, said Fine Gael could end up forming another government.The fragmented results will produce a hung parliament with no party close to 80 seats – the number for a majority and stable government in the 160-seat chamber, which includes a speaker. Varadkar has ruled out a Fine Gael pact with Sinn Féin, citing its leftwing policies and past IRA links, and floated a centrist alliance with Fianna Fáil.The former Fine Gael deputy leader James Reilly said the party needed to “reflect and decide” on whether Varadkar should remain leader if it did not form the next government. He told RTÉ there were a “number of mistakes” in a campaign “fraught with own goals” including the controversy over a proposed and then cancelled Royal Irish Constabulary commemoration.During the campaign, Martin said Fianna Fáil would not enter government with Fine Gael or Sinn Féin but since Sunday has sounded more flexible, suggesting either scenario could happen.Dara Calleary, Fianna Fáil’s director of elections, told RTÉ his party would talk with Sinn Féin about a programme for government. “We will see what programme they put together. We certainly will engage with them, we are not going to refuse to talk to them.”Brendan Howlin, the leader of the Labour party, which appeared on course to take about half a dozen seats, said any viable government would need two of the three big parties.“Ultimately we either have to have Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael together or Sinn Féin with one of those parties. That will happen in my judgment … I think that is the only stability that can be offered.” Another election would hurt Ireland, he said.Bread and butter topics dominated the campaign, which virtually ignored the issues of Northern Ireland and Brexit, but Sinn Féin said it wished to promote its defining goal – a united Ireland – in any future government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/125a1957a172170e7f475a83c4412c274e4512af/0_180_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab31d9a569470d97e7c89ff3aae08183","title":"what coronavirus precautions are you taking","story":"We’d like to hear from readers how they are reacting to reports of new infections in the UKAs the number of people in the UK who got infected with the coronavirus has risen to eight and a second Brighton GP surgery has closed temporarily because of the outbreak, the risks associated with the new virus have become more concrete in Britain.A leading health epidemiologist has claimed that the coronavirus epidemic could spread to about two-thirds of the world’s population if it cannot be controlled, and the British government has declared the virus an “imminent threat”.We would like to hear from  readers in the UK how they are responding to these warnings.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals.The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.The number of people to have contracted the virus overall could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by World Health Organization (WHO) experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has doubled from four to eight after four more people in Brighton were diagnosed with the infection over the weekend. One of the men is a doctor who was part of a group that were skiing in the resort near Chamonix with the man who is at the centre of the Brighton outbreak.One of the other four confirmed cases is being treated at the HCID unit at the Royal Free hospital in north London and the two Chinese nationals who tested positive for Coronavirus in York are being treated at the HCID centre in Newcastle.Another key unknown, of which scientists should get a clearer idea in the coming weeks, is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.Anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last two weeks and is experiencing cough or fever or shortness of breath should stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild, the NHS advises.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO’s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority are travellers who picked up the virus in China.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a “window of opportunity” to halt the spread of the disease.

Photograph: Getty Two men ran down the aircraft aisle clutching dripping sick bags as air stewards held out bin bags to receive them. Other passengers were crying as the plane jumped and shook. Storm Ciara was playing with our plane. I had been booked on the 8.55am Aer Lingus flight on Sunday, from Dublin to London Gatwick. As I sat at the gate I received a text saying my flight was cancelled, so was delighted when staff moved me onto a 10.50am flight. Others around me faced a wait until 5pm. That joy soon evaporated. We boarded at 10.30am. The woman beside me was visiting her pregnant daughter and joked they would have to call the baby Ciara. As the plane wobbled alarmingly in the strong winds on the ground, the captain said we could not leave for an hour. It looked wild outside, but I saw other planes taking off and was not too worried.When we finally began took off the plane shuddered and shook, sending my adrenaline soaring and prompting expressions of concern among other passengers.An hour later, when we descended towards Gatwick, the plane jumped and shook. We swooped down and back up violently while attempting to land four times. People were shouting and breathing deeply into their sick bags. I gripped the armrests as tightly as I could, terrified. Others were getting sick – or crying. After repeated attempts to land, lasting around one hour, the plane climbed above the clouds. The captain said because we were unable to land safely at Gatwick we needed to go to Luxembourg to refuel. We’d been in the sky for almost three hours.There was a rush to the toilets despite the seatbelt signs being on, and many people ran up the aisles cupping full sick bags. The air stewards – upbeat, kind and calm – asked passengers to remain seated. That wasn’t going to happen . . . The captain then said Luxembourg airport was full and that we had to fly to Frankfurt.Everyone laughed initially at the catalogue of mishaps, but the mood quickly changed to concern that we could run out of fuel, especially if there were problems during landing. Eventually we landed at 3pm in Frankfurt Hahn, and people started phoning relatives to say we had arrived very late, somewhere very far away from Gatwick after a four-hour flight.Some tried to recount the events of the flights others sought to downplay what happened. We remained on the plane. The stewards tried to serve refreshments, but the aisles were full of restless, hungry people, exhausted from adrenaline and seeking answers. Some people refused to stay on the plane and insisted on getting off even though they would have to find and fund their way back. There are no direct Dublin flights from Frankfurt Hahn. Eventually we were told “the powers that be” wanted the plane back in Dublin, and that Gatwick was accepting very few flights. Despite the frustration, the camaraderie among passengers was great: one man joked his daughter was delighted she would miss school the next day. Someone handed out bags from a souvenir multi-pack of Tayto. We giggled from nerves. At 5.30pm, the captain confirmed we were returning to Dublin and the tirelessly helpful stewards prepared for takeoff for the two-hour flight. As we descended into Dublin, dipping lower and lower, the plane suddenly whooshed up again and people started laughing and screaming. Were we ever going to be on the ground again?The captain said it was too windy to land on this approach so we were going to try again. My neighbours had their head in hands as I reassured them we were wobbling closer and closer to the ground.Finally we landed, at 8.30pm. The passengers cheered to be back where they started, 11 hours later.

Photograph:  Niall CarsonPA WireSinn Féin will seek to discuss the formation of a coalition government with the Green Party, the Social Democrats, Labour, Solidarity-People Before Profit and Independent TDs in the coming days. However, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald on Monday night acknowledged that the seat numbers needed to put her party in position to lead a left-leaning government may not be there when all the 160 Dáil seats are filled.She has had preliminary contact with the leaders of the smaller parties as a prelude to negotiations on putting together what would be an extraordinarily erse administration.Ms McDonald played down a controversy over a recording of Sinn Féin’s Waterford TD David Cullinane ending a speech with pro-IRA slogans, though she admitted it was a “distraction” from the party’s agenda.Mr Cullinane shouted “Up the RA! Tiocfaidh ar lá!” at the end of a victory speech to his supporters at a celebration on Sunday in Waterford, where he topped the poll by a large margin. The speech was filmed and circulated on social media. Speaking to reporters before a meeting of the party’s ard comhairle in Dublin on Monday night, Mr Cullinane said that his comments were “about the past...not about the future”. He said he did not feel any need to apologise for them.His party leader said: “I’ve asked everybody not to be making throwaway comments or comments that can be misconstrued or distract us from the work ahead, and I know that’s what happened in David’s case.” Political positioningMs McDonald also said that “of course” she intended to talk to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael about the possibility of government formation. Both parties had ruled out working with Sinn Féin after the election. Asked if she would talk to Independents such as Michael Lowry and Noel Grealish who have supported governments in the past, she said the “obvious” people to talk to would be Independents “that share a political positioning” with her party. She said that the question of a rotating taoiseach would be “part and parcel” of any negotiations with the other big parties.Fianna Fáil TDs were tightlipped in public about the party’s prospects in the wake of seat losses and about the future of party leader Micheál Martin, although some privately acknowledged that he may have to stand aside.The party is deeply ided over whether it should seek a coalition with Fine Gael or with Sinn Féin. It has ended up with 38 seats – well short of expectations of a seat haul in the mid 50s – and a view has taken hold among party TDs that it should enter opposition and allow Sinn Féin to attempt to form a minority government. Galway East TD Anne Rabbitte and Longford-Westmeath’s Robert Troy called for a party meeting to discuss the election fallout. “Fianna Fáil is a party with options. We need to discuss all of the options,” said Ms Rabbitte. Nine yearsMeanwhile, senior Fine Gael sources reiterated the view that they would not consider entering government with Sinn Féin, with some senior figures favouring a spell in opposition for the party after nine years in government. Some party sources said a coalition with Fianna Fáil could come on to the agenda after some weeks if no other government was formed. However, the views among some TDs and defeated candidates have hardened against a grand coalition. Carlow-Kilkenny Deputy and Minister of State John Paul Phelan said: “There will be no grand coalition. People wanted change, and that is what they voted for. I believe Fine Gael should go into opposition.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4169077.1581373755!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 far right candidates put in dismal showing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOne of the best performers from the far-right milieu was Gemma O’Doherty who took 1.97 per cent of the vote in Fingal. Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsIf the surge in support for Sinn Féin and parties leaning to the left was a noteworthy trend in this general election, the total failure of far-right or anti-immigration candidates to capture any respectable portion of the vote was another.The success of anti-immigrant movements across Europe and recent protests over direct provision in towns around Ireland prompted some 30 candidates from several groups to compete on a far-right platform.These candidates, who often describe themselves as “Irish patriots”, are united by strong anti-immigrant rhetoric. They frequently cross-promoted each other during the campaign.Without exception they were heavily defeated, with no candidate even polling well enough to get their expenses back.The National Party, which was established in 2016, is among the most extreme of these groups. Its leader, Justin Barrett, has attended European fascist and neo-Nazi events in the past in his role as an anti-abortion campaigner and has stated that doctors who perform abortions should receive the death penalty.Barrett himself did not run, but nine other National Party candidates did including deputy leader James Reynolds. He was the party’s best performer, getting 1.74 per cent of the vote in Longford-Westmeath.The Irish Freedom Party, founded in 2018, ran 10 candidates, with none getting more than 2.06 per cent of the vote. Its candidate in Kerry, John Bowler, a Californian who moved to Ireland in recent years, received just 0.61 per cent of the vote, while in Dublin Bay-North veteran lay litigant Ben Gilroy got 1.08 per cent.O’Doherty headlinesOne of the best performers from the far-right milieu was Gemma O’Doherty, a former Irish Independent journalist turned conspiracy theorist and anti-immigration campaigner. She took 1.97 per cent of the vote in Fingal (or 1,614 votes after transfers).O’Doherty made headlines recently for targeting a mixed-race couple on social media after they featured in a supermarket advertisement. She has also been criticised for publicly sharing photos of dark-skinned schoolchildren that she claimed showed Irish people were becoming an “ethnic minority in many towns”.This is the third election she has contested, having previously run unsuccessfully for a European seat and in the Fingal byelection last November. She also attempted to get on the 2018 presidential ticket but could not secure enough nominations.O’Doherty, who has been banned from YouTube and Facebook, ran under the banner of Anti-Corruption Ireland, an unregistered political party. Her party colleague John Waters did even worse. The author and former  columnist got 925 votes in Dún Laoghaire before being eliminated on the first count.The results for most other candidates who have expressed anti-immigration or far-right views were similarly dismal.Renua, which has increasingly espoused anti-immigrant rhetoric in recent years , did significantly worse than in 2016 and again failed to return any candidates.Casey failureBusinessman Peter Casey, who earned 23 per cent in the 2018 presidential election and has described immigration as a “ticking time bomb”, finished third-last in both Donegal and Dublin West.There were contrasting signals about how the far-right would perform in the run-up to the election. An ESRI survey reported in 2018 that 41 per cent of Irish people were open to accepting more immigration by Muslims. But in the Ipsos MRBI exit poll for The RTÉTG4UCD on Saturday, just 1 per cent of respondents cited immigration as a main voting concern.Dr Natasha Dromey, an extremism expert at University College Cork, said it would be dangerous to assume Ireland to be immune from a lurch to the far-right. “However, for now at least Ireland is not likely to be impacted too much by this in the large-scale political sense.”Some who have made controversial comments on immigration in the not so recent past did succeed. Independent TD Noel Grealish, who last year described African immigrants as “spongers”, was re-elected in Galway West.Verona Murphy, who previously linked migrants to terrorist group Islamic State, took a seat in Wexford for the first time as an Independent candidate.“We have to ensure we don’t go down the road of populism like some European countries,” said Labour leader Brendan Howlin, who was also elected in Wexford. “I think there is a responsibility on political parties to ensure that prevails within their own outfits because otherwise there will be a temptation for people to test the waters in a way that will be very isive.”Dr Dromey believes that, while there has been an increase in far-right talking points in politics and society, “far -right parties have not established themselves as any real alternative to the system, and their narrative offers little in terms of fixing the problems that the general public see as being the most significant.”Meanwhile, some of those hard-right candidates have not been taking their defeat in stride.“The Irish of #Fingal have voted once again for their own extinction,” O’Doherty posted on Twitter at the weekend.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireSinn Féin TD for Waterford David Cullinane has said his pro-IRA comments at the end of a victory speech in Waterford after his election were “about the past . . . not about the future” and that he did not feel he had anything to apologise for.However his party leader Mary Lou McDonald said the controversy was a distraction from the process of forming a government and urged her TDs not to make comments that distracted from the party’s agenda.In an address to supporters at a republican meeting in Waterford Mr Cullinane shouted “Up the ‘Ra”. He recalled that one of the ten IRA hunger strikers who died in 1981, Kevin Lynch, had been a H-Block election candidate in Waterford in 1981. At the end of the speech, he shouted: “Up the Republic, Up the ‘Ra. Tiocfaidh ár Lá.” The address to supporters was filmed on a camera phone and has been posted on Twitter. Speaking to journalists ahead of a meeting of the party’s ard comhairle in Dublin tonight, Mr Cullinane said: “Yesterday was a very emotional day for me . . . It was a long count and obviously we were very excited and very proud of the vote we got yesterday in Waterford. The 30-second clip was part of a longer speech that I gave where I was reflecting back on the hunger strikes, reflecting back on the fact that Kevin Lynch (the hunger striker) stood in the Waterford constituency in 1981. He was someone who inspired me and inspired I think many republicans. The comments were made in that context.“I know some people will think and maybe some people in the media will think that this was a comment about the here and the now and the future. They weren’t, it was reflecting back on that time in Irish history that I’m proud of and those hunger strikers and it was I suppose part of the excitement of the night when we were celebrating that victory,” he said. “But my comments were about the past, they’re not about the future. The IRA is gone as everybody knows, and I celebrate that, the same as anybody else.”Asked if he felt he needed to apologise, Mr Cullinane said: “I don’t feel I have to apologise for reflecting back on that time period. What I’m saying is that I’m putting context on the comments that I made - I in no way meant that this was about the here and the now or the future.”It was, he added, “in the context of a long day and a long night.”“I certainly don’t set out to offend anyone, that’s not my style. I’m very proud of that republican legacy but I’m also very proud of what these people behind me can do over the next while if we’re given the opportunity,” he said.Ms McDonald said that the comment would not have any effect on government formation talks, “but I do accept that they can serve as a distraction . . . I’ve asked everybody not to be making throwaway comments or comments that can be misconstrued or distract us from the work ahead, and I know that’s what happened in David’s case.”She said however, “I’m not their mammy, and I don’t censor them either. We’re all adults and I do expect people to behave in an adult way and to co-operate with their dear leader and not to create distractions. But let’s not get overexcited on this.”Earlier on Monday evening Mr Cullinane told The  he fully stood over what he had said at the rally, saying his audience, like him, were republicans. “I have never distanced myself from the IRA, or from Bobby Sands and the people who died on hunger strike, or for those who, over 100 years, were involved in the armed struggle. “That is no Secret. I have no problem saying that,” he said. “I have never had any difficulty with people taking a stance.”Asked would the phrase ‘Up the ‘Ra’ be considered insulting to some people, he said: “We are a united Ireland party and we have never distanced ourselves from that. “I do not agree with everything that the IRA did but I would not distance myself from it.”In the address Mr Cullinane referred to Mr Lynch, from Dungiven in Co Derry who died in the H-Blocks in 1981 after 71 days of fasting. “(Mr Lynch) was the H-Block candidate here in this constituency,” he said.“And what a fantastic moment it must be if his family is watching on, and people in the North are watching on, to see Sinn Féin get over 20,000 first preference votes in this constituency. “They did not break the hunger strikers. They did not break Bobby Sands and Kevin Lynch. “They will never break us. They will never break Sinn Féin. “Up the Republic, Up the Ra and Tiocfaidh ár Lá,” he shouted.

Photograph Nick BradshawThe Smaller parties have raised doubts about prospect of a Sinn Féin-led leftist coalition government, as suggested by Mary Lou McDonald. Prominent left-wing TD Richard Boyd Barrett, whose Solidarity-People Before Profit alliance won five seats in the general election, said on Monday he doesn’t believe the numbers are there for an alternative coalition of left wing parties. “If you look at the numbers… it appears we don’t quite have the numbers,” he told Newstalk. Labour’s newly elected TD for Louth Ged Nash said he felt his party would have needed to break through “the psychological barrier of 10 seats” to have any “meaningful input” in forming a left-wing government, as suggested as a possibility Ms Mary Lou McDonald.Labour finished the election with six seats in total, down one on their tally after the 2016 general election.”I don’t see the seat tally we have now as any mandate to participate in a government that will be strong and sustainable or that we can properly deliver through,” said Mr Nash. It had “not been a great election for the party, said the Drogheda politician, who won back the seat he lost in Louth in 2016. ‘Potential partners’ The party would talk “to any potential partners” but it had “bottom lines” that would need to be agreed to before entering into any talks on a programme for government, he said.Ms McDonald has said her first preference would be to form a coalition involving neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael. The Sinn Féin leader indicated she hold talks with Solidarity-People Before Profit, the Greens, the Social Democrats and Labour as well as Independents. Former Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader Bertie Ahern suggested there was a possibility of Sinn Féin forming a left coalition, with like-minded Independents. “I can’t see that being a success, but it could be,” he said. “There is a sizeable number of rural Independents, probably a group of at least 10 who are like-minded enough, who got strong votes.”On the possibility of a Fianna FáilSinn Féin coalition, Mr Ahern said he didn’t think there would be a “a sizeable number of Fianna Fáil people” who would have an appetite for it. On the suggestion of a revolving Taoiseach as part of a coalition arrangement, he added that he couldn’t think of any country where such an arrangement was in place. Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy said the “numbers are going to be tight” in its efforts to forge an administration without the two former largest parties but said “we have an obligation” to talk to the left-wing parties first over the coming days.IndependentsPeadar Tóibín, Aontu leader and Meath West TD, said he has “reached out” to about five Independents who he is planning to talk to over the coming days about a “common platform” to negotiate a place in a coalition. “Basically what we are looking at doing is to see if we can build a common platform of objectives which would be core to any future government and then potentially negotiate to have those objectives included in a programme for government,” he told RTÉ Radio One. Mr Tóibín said he wouldn’t be confining his would-be alliance to the five. Fine Gael’s outgoing Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said the “onus is on Mary Lou” to try and form a government. Ms McDonald has made preliminary contact with the leaders of the smaller parties as a prelude to negotiations on putting together what would be an extraordinarily erse administration.

Photograph: QuotidienUntil January 18th, Mila was an ordinary, 16-year-old French lycée student, with 9,000 followers on her Instagram account. That Saturday, the blonde, blue-eyed teenager carried on a live video chat with about 30 of her followers.What happened next made Mila famous, provoked a nationwide debate on the right to blasphemy and showed both the harmful effects of social media and the fragility of civil peace in France.Mila recounted the incident herself, in her only television interview, on TMC’s Quotidien programme on February 3rd. It began when somebody made unwelcome advances on the live chat. “I didn’t hesitate to put him in his place, because it’s not the first time it’s happened,” Mila said.Mila then began talking to another inidual about her sexual preferences. “I told her I was a lesbian. She asked what kind of girls I like. She said that she, personally, didn’t particularly like Arabs and blacks. I told her it was the same for me.”The young man who had made advances called Mila a dirty whore, lesbian and racist. “He insulted me a lot in the name of Allah,” Mila recalled. “I said I didn’t like Islam, that it was a religion of hatred.”Threatening, hateful messages flooded in to Mila’s Instagram account. She posted a second video the same day, to explosive effect.“I hate religion,” the teenager began, continuing with an expletive-filled attack on the Koran and Islam.The second video went viral on social media. France Bleu Isère radio reported that it was seen more than a million times. Some viewers recognised Mila and posted her name and address, and the address of her school between Lyon and Grenoble.Mila received threats of rape and murder. Some said they would wait for her outside her school. “We’re going to find you and slash your throat dirty bitch,” one threatened.She did not return to school the following Monday. Gendarmes were assigned to guard her and her family. On February 6th, the education minister said a new school had been found for her.Mila’s supporters adopted the hashtag #JeSuisMila to defend her. Her opponents used #JeNeSuisPasMila. The battle of the hashtags was a throwback to the murder of 12 people by Islamists at Charlie Hebdo magazine by Islamists five years ago. Many thousands of French people expressed solidarity with the slain journalists with the slogan Je Suis Charlie.OpinionVoltaire’s 19th-century British biographer Evelyn Beatrice Hall summarised the Enlightenment philosopher’s thought as: “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”That sentiment was expressed with regard to Charlie Hebdo, and is again in vogue regarding Mila. The consensus seems to be that Mila was stupid, but that France must defend her right to free speech.The prosecutor for the Isère department opened two investigations, one for “death threats, threats to commit a crime, harrassment and use of personal data with intent to harm” and a second, against Mila, for “provocation to racial hatred”. When he dropped the case against Mila, the prosecutor said she had merely expressed an opinion.France has recognised the right to blasphemy since 1881. An Ifop poll commissioned by Charlie Hebdo found the country is split 5050 between those who support that right and those who oppose it.At least two politicians – justice minister Nicole Belloubet and the former socialist presidential candidate Ségolène Royal – raised hackles with comments on the case. Belloubet said that “insulting a religion is an attack on freedom of conscience” Royal said, “I refuse to hold up a disrespectful teenager as a paragon of the freedom of expression.”Two officials at the French Muslim Council CFCM joined in the fray. The first, Abdallah Zekri, said, “This girl knows very well what she is doing. Who sows the wind harvests the tempest.” Zekri was corrected by the CFCM’s president, Mohammed Moussaoui. “Nothing can justify death threats against a person, no matter how offensive their remarks are,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4170297.1581422561!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"von der leyen surprised at uk suggestion of australia style eu relationship","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Strasbourg on Tuesday. Photograph: Jean-Francois BadiasAPBoris Johnson’s suggestion that the UK could be prepared to accept an Australian-style relationship with the EU without a formal trade deal has “surprised” Brussels. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen pointed out that even Australia wants a better trading relationship with the bloc than the one it currently has.She said the UK and EU should be “way more ambitious” about reaching a full trade deal.In a speech setting out the UK’s negotiating objectives, the British prime minister said the question was whether to seek a Canadian-style deal or an Australian-style relationship, “and I have no doubt that in either case the UK will prosper”.But speaking in the European Parliament, Ms von der Leyen said both models fell short of a deal which would meet the goals of allowing trade without tariffs and quotas.That aim, set out in the political declaration, would require a “level playing field” with both sides guaranteeing “fair competition and the protection of social, environmental and consumer standards”.“We are ready to discuss all different models of trade agreement. But all these models, whatever you choose, have one thing in common — they all come not only with rights but also with obligations for both sides.”The Canada deal eliminates most, but not all, tariffs and quotas and “we still have our standards that have to be respected”, she said.Ms von der Leyen added: “Honestly, I was a little bit surprised to hear the prime minister of the United Kingdom speak about the Australian model.“Australia, without any doubt, is a strong and a like-minded partner. But the European Union does not have a trade agreement with Australia.“We are currently trading on WTO terms and, if this is the British choice, well, we are fine with that, without any question.”But the EU was trying to negotiate a trade deal with Australia to end the current situation.“Of course the UK can decide to settle for less, but I personally believe that we should be way more ambitious,” she said.Javid plansMs von der Leyen’s speech in Strasbourg came as the UK government set out further details of its plans for January 1st, 2021 after the Brexit transition period expires.Chancellor Sajid Javid said the government will aim to conclude a full range of equivalence assessments by June 2020 – allowing the UK and EU to respect each other’s rules.But he said the UK would also have the freedom to erge and regulate in a different way from the rules set in Brussels.Writing in City AM, he said: “Each side will only grant equivalence if it believes the other’s regulations are compatible.“But compatible does not mean identical, and both the UK and the EU have at different times recognised the importance of focusing on regulatory outcomes.“We will no longer be rule-takers, but we remain committed to the highest international standards of financial regulation and to shaping global rule-making.”But Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier said: “I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear to certain people in the United Kingdom bearing authority that they should not kid themselves about this – there will not be general, open-ended, ongoing equivalence in financial services.”The EU would “retain a free hand to take our own decisions”.Senior cabinet minister Michael Gove confirmed on Monday that goods coming to Britain from the EU will face import controls from January 1st.The British Retail Consortium said the government would have to move fast to get infrastructure in place for the start of 2021, warning that without adequate preparations the availability of goods on shelves would be disrupted, with fresh fruit and vegetables especially vulnerable.Mr Barnier told MEPs it would not be “business as usual” after January 1st.“Come what may, on January 1st we will be imposing checks on all products entering the single market, just as we do to every other third country in the world,” he said. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4168469.1581361528!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern ireland scotland bridge being considered by british officials","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson attends an awards ceremony held at the Banqueting House, London. Photograph: David ParryPA WireBritish government ministers are actively looking into Boris Johnson’s idea of a road bridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland, Downing Street has said, rejecting scepticism on the issue from engineers and criticism of the prime minister’s own somewhat mixed record on delivering bridges.“Government officials are carrying out work in relation to the idea of a bridge linking the GB mainland to Northern Ireland,” Mr Johnson’s spokesman said, saying this was being done by “a range” of officials reporting into Number 10.“There is a proper piece of work being carried out into the idea,” the spokesman said. “It is reporting into Number 10, but obviously we will take advice from wherever it is needed.” He gave no details on when the work would be completed.Mr Johnson, who as London mayor spearheaded the doomed garden bridge project which cost more than £50 million (about €60 million) without work even beginning, first raised the idea of the 32km-plus bridge to Larne in Northern Ireland in 2018.He called again for the link during the Conservative leadership campaign, despite engineers expressing scepticism at the idea of building such a link over waters more than 300m deep in places, parts of which were used by the British ministry of defence to dump more than 1 million tonnes of obsolete munitions.The plan has been seen as a concession to Northern Irish unionists, especially given their concern at new customs checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK under Mr Johnson’s Brexit plan.Asked about the bridge by the DUP MP Ian Paisley in the House of Commons in December, Mr Johnson called it “a very interesting idea”, adding: “I advise him to watch this space and, indeed, to watch the space between the islands, because what he has said has not fallen on deaf ears.”Long-standing enthusiasmMr Johnson has long been an enthusiast for major infrastructure projects, but his visions only sometimes become reality, and those which do have had a tendency to not fully deliver on his promises.As London mayor, Mr Johnson pushed repeatedly for the garden bridge across the Thames, despite repeated warnings about its economic unfeasibility and the complication of securing planning consents, wasting £53.5 million of funds, £43 million of it taxpayers’ money.An even more ambitious idea for a new London airport in the Thames estuary came to nothing. As mayor, Mr Johnson did deliver a £60 million cable car across the Thames in east London, but a supposed key transport link later turned out to have just four regular users.More expensive still was Mr Johnson’s plan for a “new Routemaster” bus for the city, allowing passengers to hop on and off open platforms.Transport for London paid more than £280 million for a fleet of the buses which turned out to be baking hot in the summer, with the doors kept closed for safety reasons, and were unable to be sold to any other cities. Last month it was announced that the buses’ rear doors would be kept closed due to rampant fare evasion.Mr Johnson’s spokesman rejected criticism of this record: “The prime minister is ambitious in terms of infrastructure projects. He’s looking at a wide range of schemes across the UK which could boost connectivity.” – Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Back then, the risk was all thought to be on Mrs Merkel’s part.It is a measure of how far Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer, or AKK as she likes to be known, has fallen from grace that her announcement on Monday that she would not lead her party into next year’s election had an air of inevitability about it.Back in 2018, she used to be known as mini-Merkel. But the nickname has disappeared as the expectation she could live up to her mentor\u0027s example has faded.In just over a year as Christian Democrat (CDU) leader she has lurched from gaffe to gaffe and the party has continued its inexorable slide in the polls.But it was last week’s debacle in Thuringia, when CDU politicians defied her and broke the party’s traditional “firewall” against the far-Right to vote alongside the nationalist Alternative for Germany party (AfD), that finished Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer.She claimed on Monday she was stepping down because some in the CDU were not prepared to delineate the party strongly enough against the AfD and the Left party.But the truth, harsh though it may sound, is that she just wasn’t up to the job. That was clear last week as she foundered for a response to the Thuringian crisis and Mrs Merkel had to step in.Where Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer had vacillated and negotiated with the rebel politicians, Mrs Merkel ended the crisis with a simple statement, announcing that what they had done was “unforgivable” and must be reversed. It was a brutal demonstration of the difference between the two women, and a death blow to Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer’s personal authority.For an idea of how seriously the “firewall” against any cooperation with the AfD is taken in German politics, consider only that last week’s events were openly compared to the rise of the Nazi party.But if Thuringia ended AKK’s hopes of succeeding Mrs Merkel, her bid started to unravel long before. It began within months after she secured the CDU leadership at the end of 2018.There was her disastrous attempt to woo the party’s conservative wing with an off-colour joke about third gender toilets being for men “who aren\u0027t sure whether they can still pee standing up”.When she was called out on that, she doubled down by accusing Germans of being “the most uptight people in the world” — not a good line for some one trying to become chancellor of Germany.But AKK’s biggest mistake in her first months as leader was probably allowing the impression she was on manoeuvres to ease Mrs Merkel out of power early so she could take her place.Mrs Merkel had engineered AKK’s rise within the party specifically to prolong her own time as chancellor. Whatever the truth of what AKK was up to in those early months, by letting reports she wanted Mrs Merkel gone go unchallenged, she appears to have alienated her most important ally.When the CDU performed badly in last year’s European elections, Mrs Merkel repaid her in kind, allowing the word to go around that she had “lost faith” in her former protege.And last September, in a particularly cutting display of power, Mrs Merkel refused to allow AKK and her entourage to share her ministerial flight to the US for the UN climate summit.Without Mrs Merkel’s protection, AKK quickly began to founder. She had an almost uncanny ability for gaffes in the immediate run-up to elections.Just before the European elections she fumbled the CDU’s response to an attack from a prominent Youtube star, allowing it to go unanswered for days.And in the run-up to regional elections in eastern Germany last year she picked a fight with one of the party’s most popular figures in the region.Then there was the confusion over her ministerial role. When she became CDU leader she made great play of the fact she wasn’t taking a cabinet job so she could concentrate on rebuilding the party’s electoral fortunes.But in a U-turn last summer she took on the defence ministry, widely seen as one of the toughest roles in German government. She tried to spin it as a chance to prove herself in high office. But it was no secret in Berlin that she took the job in order to block Jens Spahn, one of her closest rivals, from taking it and using it as a launchpad to challenge her.For a woman already struggling with the party leadership, it was a ludicrous extra burden.Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer will not depart immediately. She said on Monday she would stay on as party leader over the summer while the CDU elects a chancellor candidate to lead it into next year’s election.That race looks set to reopen isions between the Merkellian, moderate wing and the conservatives, and the debate over the party’s future direction.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis irish voters take sinn fein mainstream united ireland","story":"The prospect of the nationalist Sinn Fein entering government in Ireland now looks to be very real following last weekend’s election, a move that will make many British voters that recall the Troubles instinctively deeply uncomfortable.But in a world of fragmenting politics that had already ended the longtime duopoly of Ireland’s two mainstream governing parties - Fine Gael and Fianna Fail - it was perhaps only a matter of time before Sinn Fein found a route to power.Still, it seems that no-one - least of all Sinn Fein itself, which didn’t stand in many constituencies - foresaw this happening so quickly, given that the party had polled around 11 per cent in recent European and Presidential elections.But by winning the second-largest number of seats in the Dáil, there is now a very real prospect that a British foreign minister will find themselves sitting across the table from a Sinn Fein Tanaiste whose party is avowedly in favour of reuniting Ireland.This at a time when the British prime minister talks about \u0027cementing the union\u0027 with a £15 billion \u0027Boris bridge\u0027 between Ireland and Scotland - as Northern Ireland’s Unionists complain bitterly that Mr Johnson’s Brexit deal is inexorably sucking the province into Dublin’s economic orbit.If Brexit was not already testing the viability of the deliberate constitutional limbo that underpinned the Good Friday Agreement, then the prospect of Sinn Fein in government surely does so.This does not mean that a ‘border poll’ is anywhere close to being an immediate prospect, since a vote on Irish unity can only be triggered by the British secretary of state “if at any time it appears likely to him” that a majority in Northern Ireland would vote for unification.The best available data, from the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey which has been surveying opinion since the 1998 peace deal was signed, still only shows around a quarter of Northern Ireland’s population are explicitly pro-unification.Forthcoming election data is expected to show a potential narrow majority among Catholics for Irish Unity, but taking into account the entire population of Northern Ireland, the secretary of state currently has no grounds to call a poll.That is not to diminish the seismic nature of last weekend’s result, and the potential it provides both to change the dynamic between London and Dublin, but also within the Republic of Ireland itself.Although Sinn Fein’s president Mary Lou McDonald clearly won voters over on an anti-austerity ticket, the price of any coalition will be to formalise the unification agenda through a government White Paper that will give official form and content to the idea.If that is the case, then what is now a talking point down the pub or at the bus stop can be given an official, bureaucratic structure and legitimacy that, incrementally, can lay the foundations for the longer term ambitions for unification.We live in constitutionally febrile times. No one can be sure precisely how the Irish ‘frontstop’, with its capacity to hit both business and consumers in the North, will impact the discussion on unification - nor indeed the impact of a Scottish vote for secession.The prospect of Sinn Fein entering government in Dublin is another destabilising ingredient in that volatile constitutional mix.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british government would do coronavirus spreads","story":"As the risk of coronavirus increases, the government is urging local authorities and others to put in place contingency plans to mitigate its potential impact - but what will be needed and when is still uncertain.Plans range from warning religious groups to limit “close contacts”, urging employers to use video conferencing rather than face-to-face meetings, and ensuring that if worst comes to worst, local authorities have capacity to cremate and bury the dead to stop the disease from spreading further.While the situation in the UK remains calm, with only eight cases confirmed so far, government planners are taking precautions.Their response is being driven by the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011, and although this document was prepared for an outbreak of a new strain of flu, it\u0027s believed to provide a solid template for the management of coronavirus containment and treatment.In practical terms, if the coronavirus was to take root in Britain as it has in China, these are the sort of measures we might expect to see introduced here: Although schools were kept open during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, case numbers dropped sharply when schools broke up for the holidays, highlighting the role children play in spreading viruses.Imperial College London study published in the Lancet at the time predicted that prolonged closures could reduce the scale of the outbreak by 13-17 per cent and cut the number of swine flu cases by 38-45 per cent at the outbreaks’ peak. It is therefore hoped that closure of schools during the pandemic might break the chains of transmission the researchers said.On Monday it was reported that St Mary\u0027s Independent School in Southampton was being closed after a child who had traveled to China developed symptoms of coronavirus.We have taken advice on this situation from Public Health England and the Natural Health Service”, said Claire Charlemagne, the school\u0027s headteacher.  But closing schools across England and Wales would not be a decision ministers would make lightly. School closures would cause serious disruption for millions of working parents and lead to a to GDP loss of up to 1 per cent by some estimates. It would also hit NHS capacity hard with as much as 30 per cent of staff having to take time off to look after children just when they are needed most.All businesses should adopt “robust and flexible” contingency plans in case of a pandemic, including appointing a “pandemic coordinator or team” to drive the company response, the Government says.This covers everything from securing supply chains to protecting customers and staff.Initially at least, the overriding focus should be on reducing the spread of infection. This should include providing hand washing facilities and sanitising hand gels, introducing video conferencing in place of face-to face meetings and people working from home where possible.Staggered shifts to reduce overcrowding and restriction on “non-essential” travel, especially to locations known to have a high incidence of the virus, are also recommended, and employers should expect some employees to be absent from personal illness, or bereavement, or transport delays.There are unlikely to be bans on taking public transport but if the the spread of the virus picks up place, expect the government to recommend “non-essential” travel is avoided.Also expect a major information campaign about the importance of good hand and respiratory hygiene when using public transport systems.Trains, buses and especially hub stations are easy places to spread and catch viruses from shared surfaces such as ticket machines, hanging straps, and seats.With most pandemics “hotspots” appear - areas in which the spread of disease races ahead of others. It is possible that local authorities would introduce additional, more draconian, restrictions around such hotspots.  The Government says it is “unlikely to recommend a blanket ban” on religious gatherings or other get-togethers. However, it warns groups - including faith groups - to be aware of the spread of viruses through “close contact” and advises that organisers pay particular attention to hygiene arrangements.Sharing a communal cup is almost certainly a bad idea whether it be in a church or a nightclub. Beware also packed sports stadiums.In the event of a really widespread outbreak, expect nightclubs, restaurants, sports clubs and highstreets to empty voluntarily, just as they have in much of Asia.Estimates for the proportion of people requiring hospitalisation after contracting coronavirus is high, at around 20-30 per cent.  This may change for the better as more is learnt about the virus but it points to a major squeeze on hospital capacity in the UK.Were this to happen, the NHS could start cancelling all but the most urgent primary and secondary care appointments.The government has substantial powers to prevent and control risks to human health from infection or contamination. These powers , which in extremis can seem draconian, stem largely from the recently updated Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984.Generally, there is no need to compel people to take action but provided a justice of the peace is satisfied that the situation is serious enough, they can require that you undergo a medical examination, and be kept in isolation.“These figures might be expected to be reduced by the impact of countermeasures, but the effectiveness of such mitigation is not certain”, it adds.Taking account of this, local planners have been set the target of preparing to extend funeral capacity on a “precautionary but reasonably practicable basis”, and aim to cope with a population mortality rate of up to 210,000 to 315,000 additional deaths, possibly over as little as a 15-week period and perhaps half of these over 3 weeks at the height of the outbreak.Local authorities are provided with “a framework”  for managing deaths deaths in the case of a pandemic. Just as has been the case with Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a priority around the burial will be to ensure it is done promptly and without a ceremony that involves the display and touching of the deceased.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security.

While mapping out the garden, I put together a few tips and tricks to help get you started on your own sustainable vegetable patch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPlan out where to place your\u0026nbspplantsRoot to fruit: How to join the ethical food revolutionI like to plant crops that grow on vines (think: cucumbers and cherry tomatoes) in small groups, as close to a fence as possible so they scale upwards, while giving other plants that will likely grow much larger a separate space off to the side. That way, I can still walk by and tend to the crops growing up the fence, no matter how big the other plants off to the side eventually grow.\u0026nbspThis also works with smaller plots of soil like community garden space: keep clusters of similar plants in the same tight groups, and don’t worry so much about spacing. With some proper TLC, plants usually find their way around each other in the dirt.\u0026nbspSeeds can always begin growing indoors ahead of the season around the time you lay out your soil, which will provide you with plenty of time to start growing your crops in a stable environment. Some farmers will recommend you transport these seeds to your garden based on the location of the moon, but since I don’t have time for all that, I simply give the soil a good rinse of water for a week before transporting or planting anything in my garden.Study your plotBefore stepping into that dirt, it’s important to study your space and gain an understanding of how many hours of sunlight you’re working with and what kind of plants grow well in the region. Most will require about eight hours of sun, but if you’re in a shaded area and can only get six, that should still work, as many plants favour partial shade and only require about four hours of direct sunlight.\u0026nbspGetting a head start on laying out the groundwork for your garden will help it produce sustainable harvests that last throughout the summer months – and then some. You can look up the last frost date in your region here.\u0026nbspI tend to lay out my organic soil exactly where I plant to grow my garden about six weeks before this date.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Back to our roots: Warming winter vegetables recipes Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Maximise your spaceIt’s also just as important to consider ways to maximise the space while gardening.

Most crops only need a few inches of space for their roots to grow: things like peppers, tomatoes, broccoli and kale can all grow much closer together than most people think. I tend to believe that crops grow better when they’re in close, clustered mixes of similar plants, but that’s just my unprofessional semi-gardening enthusiast opinion.Transplant the seeds to your garden once its warm enough for them to survive in an outdoor climate, but only when the seeds are busting out of their trays or starter pots. The seeds should look vibrant and almost too big for their trays by the time they are brought to the garden for planting.\u0026nbspI tend to believe the first moments catering to a garden and each inidual plant are some of the most important in a life cycle the only way a garden will produce healthy crops is with tender love and care during its birth. These moments of transporting, growing the seeds, placing them into the ground and giving them nutrients and fresh water throughout the process are all vital to the longevity of a harvest.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In my 2020 quest for a more sustainable kitchen, I’ve installed a wormery in my back garden. A small move but for me a big one, as I’m still reeling from the time my brother threw a tin of worms at me when I was six years old.\u0026nbspThe worms will feed on kitchen scraps\u0026nbspbits of cabbage, banana peels, and egg shells (no oil, no dairy please) that my 2019.0 version would have tossed into the garbage. They’ll reside in a multi-level des res and churn my waste into compost. But as I feverishly read the instructions, I learn that during the first 24-hours they might ‘wander’ and head for the great outdoors. \u0026nbspI call Ronnie, co-owner of Wormcity Wormery, who calms me down. Yes, there is a potential for wander but adding a handful of our own back garden soil helps ‘welcome’ the worms to their new home. No, it’s not a problem that I’m going away for a week — they need time to get settled and overfeeding is a no-no anyway. I hang up feeling like I’ve had a session with my own worm therapist.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhy I’m promising to end all my food wasteIf you’ve got any back garden space, then a wormery is an easy way to reduce your kitchen carbon footprint. You can find them online and at garden shops and it’s an easy-to-assemble box system (more mouths  more food waste  more levels). I chose Wormcity because — aside from the fact that Ronnie doesn’t mind answering my inane questions — their wormeries are made from recycled plastic in England, so helpfully reducing travel miles.\u0026nbspMy composting worms should live for around two to three years. They’re prolific, doubling their numbers every three to four months. Even better, they’re hungry — eating up to half their body weight in food every day. That’s a lot of carrot peelings. It will take around four months for my worms to turn a tray of food scraps into compost but when they do, it will be so nutrient rich (about ten thousand times the bacteria and microbes of normal compost) that I’ll only need a small amount to use as a top dressing.\u0026nbspOf course, recycling is only part of the sustainability push. Many argue that the first rule, the mantra, if you will,\u0026nbspis to reduce. If we reduce the amount we buy in the first place, then we won’t need to recycle so much. We’ll also save money. The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that an average American family of four loses $1,500 a year on uneaten food. Like many, I’ve become a BOGO junkie — buying two bottles of juice when I can only drink one at a time or splashing out on three packets of sweet potato falafel for the price of two, when I know that I’ll be pushed to finish the second, let alone the third, by the time I reach the use-by date. Every time I buy food, the clock is ticking. It might be ticking loudly, like when I buy a packet of chicken thighs, but even if I’m buying something shelf stable like rice or pasta, it’s still ticking.After my January fridge detox, I realised that the more stuff I’ve got in my fridge, the harder it is to find anything. And sadly when I do, it might be too late. During my trawl, I discovered two open bottles of fish sauce, which by anyone’s standards is one too many. I know exactly what happened — I was in a rush, opened up the fridge, did a quick look, didn’t (couldn’t) see any so opened another bottle. Shame on me.\u0026nbspNow I’m shopping with intention, as I call it. Considering my purchases more carefully and using up what I’ve got before I go crazy buying more. I rescued some Jurassic-era carrots from the veg bin but rather than throw them out, I peeled them, gave them a quick turn in salted boiling water and a refresh in cold water. The wrinkled romano pepper that looked like something out of an ad for sunscreen was sliced, seeded, roasted and then blitzed with nuts, lemon zest, olive oil, garlic and some almost-chuckable herbs. I tossed the carrots in my ersatz romesco sauce and they were delicious.\u0026nbspI discovered no less than three containers of parmesan cheese in the dark recesses of my fridge. I combined them so they’re easier to locate and will use the wedge for grating and toss the nobbly rinds into my next batch of minestrone for an umami hit. Containers heading to the freezer are labelled now, with the exception of a mystery one I missed, which I’ve decided is either chilli con carne or bolognaise. Only time and defrosting will tell.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’d add to that my trick to use up the last bits in a jar of mustard. Leave the mustard in the jar, add vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper and you’ve got a bottle of vinaigrette.Meanwhile, I just checked on my worms.

That requires precise control, and engineers have so far been unable to do it.This is life under the longest internet shutdown in historyNow researchers think they have found a way of controlling that very fast modulation, using sound and light.This is exciting research,\u0026nbspsaid John Cunningham, Professor of Nanoelectronics at Leeds. At the moment, the system for modulating a quantum cascade laser is electrically driven - but that system has limitations.Ironically, the same electronics that delivers the modulation usually puts a brake on the speed of the modulation. The mechanism we are developing relies instead on acoustic waves.When an electron passes through the optical part of the laser, it travels through a host of quantum wells that throw out a pulse of light energy. An electron can emit a number of those photons, and that is controlled – using soundwaves\u0026nbspto vibrate those quantum wells – in the new experiment.Essentially, what we did was use the acoustic wave to shake the intricate electronic states inside the quantum cascade laser, said\u0026nbspTony Kent, Professor of Physics at Nottingham. We could then see that its\u0026nbspterahertz\u0026nbsplight output was being altered by the acoustic wave.The research is not perfect, and more control is still needed before the lasers could be used reliably to transmit data. But with further work they could lead to major breakthroughs in transmitting data.We did not reach a situation where we could stop and start the flow completely, but we were able to control the light output by a few percent, which is a great start, said Professor Cunningham.We believe that with further refinement, we will be able to develop a new mechanism for complete control of the photon emissions from the laser, and perhaps even integrate structures generating sound with the terahertz laser, so that no external sound source is needed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They have even seen that limited numbers of them appear to repeat.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the new breakthrough, spotted by scientists using a telescope in Canada and described in an early paper published online, is the first time that researchers have seen the blasts appearing in a regular, predictable pattern.Astronomers have no confirmed explanation for the FRBs, with the only certain fact about their origin that they must be coming from somewhere very extreme and unusual. Proposed explanations have included everything from alien civilisations sending us messages to a star falling into a black hole, but the fact that the messages are repeating have led some scientists to lead out such cataclysmic causes.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Over the course of the cycle, the bursts will appear intensely for a four day flurry that sees a signal come every hour or more, and then it will go quiet for 12 days.That pattern is an important clue to the nature of this object, the researchers write in the new paper.Are aliens sending us messages from light years away?It appears to be coming from the edge of a massive spiral galaxy, about 500 million light years away, the researchers say. But there are few other clues about where it could be coming from or the processes that may have given rise to it.The fact that it is repeating over a predictable period could suggest that it is coming from a binary system, since other objects in space that demonstrate similar characteristics tend to be binary systems, too. The object could be being swung around by a star or black hole, and the periodic blasts could be an indication that the object is facing us during those times, the researchers say.It could also be possible that winds or tidal disruptions from the black hole block the signal during the periods it is silent, they note.The repeating signals were spotted by the\u0026nbspCanadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, which spends time looking for more FRBs in an attempt to find their origin. It should spend more time looking at the source of the current bursts – known as\u0026nbspFRB 180916.J0158+65 – in an attempt to learn more about it, the researchers conclude in their paper, which is for now published on the website ArXiv before being peer reviewed and published in a journal.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If this were the case, banks and other financial institutions could base themselves in the UK knowing they might not be frozen out by EU regulators one day to the next.As a result of Britain\u0027s departure from the EU, City firms will lose their automatic passporting rights to keep doing business on the continent.Created with Sketch.Brexit celebrations in Parliament Square Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit supporters celebrating in Parliament Square, after the UK left the European Union on 31 January.

Half the time he didn’t have a tie,” said one response, along with “he sat on the fence on Brexit.

He’d run around with his hands in the air.”The verdict comes after The Independent revealed how a close friend and adviser to Mr Corbyn blamed a “corridor cabal” of his top aides for wrecking his election campaign.Lord Ashcroft, despite his political allegiance, has built a strong reputation for his research into voting reasons at recent elections and referendums.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But in the primary’s last few days, someone else broke into the upper tier.Arise, Amy Klobuchar, a longtime senator who just happens to hail from one of the most important states on the Democrats’ target list: Minnesota.For all the talk about the so-called “blue wall” states that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016, namely Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Klobuchar’s home state is one of several traditionally safe Democratic states that slipped perilously close to turning red.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTop (or bottom) of that list is New Hampshire, which Clinton won by only 0.37 points — but Minnesota is second. Clinton defeated Trump there by just 44,765 votes, or 1.52 points. As the Democrats try and build an electoral college majority once again, that’s close enough to be deeply concerning.Created with Sketch.Democratic candidates compete on the campaign trail: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds up a sign criticising billionaires in the presidential race in front of Michael Bloomberg in Compton, Califronia.

From left to right: Billionaire-philanthropist Tom Steyer, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, former vice president Joe Biden, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota senator Amy KlobucharBut thanks to Clinton’s near miss, its moment in the sun has come. The Democrats need to hold on to every state they can, and that’s before they pick up several others. And so, to Klobuchar.Since the start of her campaign, she has consistently argued that winning three consecutive\u0026nbspsenate elections for her Minnesota seat proves she can hold on to or win back Midwestern swing states. That record does rather set her apart from the rest of the Democratic top tier:\u0026nbspPete Buttigeig has only won mayoral elections in a small city, in a state the Democrats look highly unlikely to win this year, while Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders hail from Democratic home turf in Massachusetts and Vermont.\u0026nbspAnd while much has been made of Joe Biden’s roots in Pennsylvania, his decades-long career was in tiny and ultra-safe Delaware, and his floundering campaign may not even get him through the looming South Carolina primary.Klobuchar’s record therefore makes her uniquely appealing, and she seems well-placed to leverage it today. Political scientist and US politics expert Brian Klaas said: “Klobuchar is popular across the state,” boasting “approval ratings that reflect her ability to win over swing voters but also win over some Republicans”.On the face of it, this was borne out by her re-election as senator in 2018, when she won 57 of Minnesota’s 87 counties and bested her Republican challenger by 24 points. But in fact, her performance somewhat ebbed even in a year where the Democrats did well nationwide — and more concerning still, her vote apparently shifted away from “Trump country” towards the state’s urban centres.For 2020 Democrats, Granite State is boom or bustHow much does winning the New Hampshire primary actually matter?There’s only one Democrat who can oust TrumpAccording to Klaas, this may not be enough in an election with Trump on the ballot. “For a Democrat to win in Minnesota, they need to do well statewide. They need to run up a substantial margin in the Twin Cities — the neighbouring cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul that straddle the Mississippi — but they can’t win just with cities.“They need to have support in the suburbs, which are often swing districts but broke for the Democrats in the 2018 midterms. And rural Minnesota is largely Trump territory these days, but soybean farmers in the south are being hit badly by Trump’s trade war, and many iron ore miners in the northeast Iron Range who voted for Trump come from union households that have voted for Democrats for generations.”So can Klobuchar do it? Even beyond the so-called “home state advantage”, which has been the subject of decades of academic research, she has several advantages over Hillary Clinton: she isn’t trying to win her party a third consecutive term, she has relatively little baggage of her own, and she’s running against a controversial Republican incumbent.But first, she has to win the nomination. And on that front, she has a ways to go. Heading into the New Hampshire primary, an Ipsos poll found that more than a third of respondents either don’t have an opinion about her or hadn’t heard of her at all. If she wants to lead the Democrats into Minnesota and elsewhere this November, she’ll have to raise her profile — and soon.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She made the surprise announcement after a meeting of members.\u0026nbspMs Merkel herself told reporters in Berlin: “I acknowledged this decision today with the greatest amount of respect, but I want to say that I regret it.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The young folk born this century, like my -year-old daughter, do not watch it. The BBC means nothing to Generation YouTube.And the millions of us who grew up with the Beeb no longer recognise it as the benign Auntie that gave us Doctor Who, Top Of The Pops, Le On Earth, Fawlty Towers, The Likely Lads and David Dimbleby staying up all night at the General Election.That old beloved BBC — endlessly entertaining, scrupulously fair — is dead now. The BBC’s coverage of the night we left the European Union was nothing less than shameful.Here was a moment of truly historical signicance, the kind of national event that the BBC was born to cover. And it was dished up like a dull night at the Eurovision Song Contest.Down in Parliament Square, awash with Union Jacks and peaceful, happy patriots, BBC reporter Geeta Guru-Murthy blurted: “It’s a very white crowd mostly” — to the bewilderment of the many black and Asian people who were there to celebrate.But, of course, the BBC continues to peddle the filthy little lie that Brexit has its roots in the racism of the bigoted British people.Meanwhile, Sophie Raworth sat primly in a BBC studio made up to look like the EU flag. The studio never turned red, white and blue. There was no sense that the largest vote for anything in British history was being honoured. Why must we pay £billion a year for this one-sided garbage My colleague Ally Ross has pointed out that BBC “comedy” shows like Have I Got News For You, Frankie Boyle’s New World Order and The Mash Report have all been larded with anti-Brexit orthodoxy for years. Now the predictably loony Remainer-speak even seeps into the poison the BBC drips into our children.On the day we left the EU, the BBC released a CBBC Horrible Histories special mocking British stupidity.Queen Victoria was accused of callously sweetening her tea with sugar harvested by slaves — even though slavery was abolished four years before Victoria came to the throne.Historian Andrew Roberts described the mocking film as “a stream of bigoted hatred directed at this country”. They truly don’t get it in Broadcasting House. Millions of licence fee payers are deeply offended by the BBC’s relentlessly anti-British, anti-Brexit sentiment.It is why we fell out of love with the BBC. There is talk about decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, or making payment optional. But the BBC no longer represents the entire nation. It peddles the prejudices of the disappointed elite who run it.The BBC does not speak for the British people. It doesn’t even seem to like us very much. So why should we pay anything at all for this crap AFTER being overlooked at the Oscars for her sensational performance in Hustlers, the half-time show at the Super Bowl felt like the revenge of Jenner Lopez.But Hustlers is my favourite film of the past  months. Lopez deserved an Oscar for her role.And whoever wins Best Actress at the Oscars tonight, I bet they can’t slide down a pole like her.MICHELLE OBAMA always said: “When they go low, we go high.”Meaning that when the Republican opponents of President Obama struck a low blow the Obamas had a strict policy of keeping their cool, their dignity and the moral high ground.The most senior Democratic politician in America just failed to take Michelle Obama’s advice. At his State of the Union address, President Trump petulantly refused to shake the hand of NancyPelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives. Pelosi should have shrugged off Trump’s rudeness and perhaps laughed in Donald’s orange face.Instead, clearly boiling with rage, Nancy ripped a copy of Trump’s speech to pieces. As the speech was full of optimistic stuff about making America a fairer, more prosperous place, the only person Pelosi humiliated was herself.The Democrats are starting to make Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party look like an effective opposition.THE classic James Bond films – Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger – were all less than two hours long.But in the modern fashion for over-long movies – The Irishman clocks in at three hours and  minutes – the next Bond film, No Time To Die, will be the longest ever at almost three hours.Let’s hope that means plenty of Ana de Armas, , as Bond girl Paloma. And not too much of Daniel Craig, , moaning about ’s dodgy knees.Teenage girls are messier than teenage boys. But teenage boys are, in my experience, more likely to leave takeaway pizza under the bed for six months for the mice to nibble.And when vermin move in, you really long for your little darling to move out.SUCKING up to the millionaire snowflakes in the audience, Prince William complained about the lack of ersity at the Baftas.I don’t believe it. This year a black actor, Micheal Ward, won the Rising Star Bafta for gang film Blue Story. Six years ago,  Years A Slave won Best Picture, competing with epic Hollywood fare like Gravity.If the film or performance is good enough, then the Baftas is colour blind.The real lack of ersity is among British actors. These days most of them went to Eton with Prince William. Now that’s what I call a lack of ersity.A SURVEY reveals that  per cent of Canadians are against paying the £million to-£million-a-year security bill for Harry and Meghan’s new le.Wherever they lay their hats, from Toronto to Tinsel Town, there is only one sucker who will ever pay for Harry and Meghan’s security.

How many orgasms will it take  How many fake groans will get her through this ”Greer’s comments come after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s decision to step back from the Royal Family last month.Since quitting their roles as senior royals, it has been reported that Megan is looking for an agent in a possibleto showbiz, with Harry even caught on camera pitching his we as a voice over artist to Disney CEO Bob Iger.Many believe their self-imposed abdication was a ploy driven by the “fame-hungry” former Suits star in a bid toto Hollywood.Long-time royal critic Germaine Greer suggests there were warning signs of ‘Megxit’ from the outset.Greer told  Minutes the Duchess’ potential to manipulate her husband in order to climb the “celebrity” ladder was evident in their extravagant £ million wedding, which was “full of showbiz.”She said: “The marriage was terrible too, because it was full of showbiz personalities, asMegan lived in a completely articial world.”The whole point about showbiz - its not real, and it wont sustain you.”Greer explained she wasnt at all surprised when the couple announced their plans to step back from Royal duties just  days after walking down the aisle.Just two years ago, she told  Minutes: Shell bolt. Shes bolted before,” alluding to Meghan’s former failed marriage.Her eerie prediction was based on the argument that a combination of boredom and pressure would see Meghan call time, adding: But maybe she’ll take Harry with her.Greer’s scepticism was backed by Prince Harry’s official biographer,Angela Levin, who on Sunday claimed the Duke’s bid to make his we happy was “to the detriment of himself,” and that Meghan’s focus on celebrity was to blame for her unpopularity – not racism.Levin said: “I think a lot of the criticism has come about because she sort of lectures the public on how they should behave, but not do it herself.”We shouldnt fly, but she can go off on private jets to Elton John and see the Clooney’s and all that sort of thing.”Also speaking to  Minutes on Sunday, Trisha Goddard argued it was indeed the force of racist undercurrents in the UK that was to blame for the couple’s relocation to Canada.She told reporter Tom Steinfort: “Theres a narrative thats been here long before Meghan Markle, which bubbled to the surface about this.”“There are ways of saying things you know about, ‘Them, exotic’. A lot of it is also very misogynistic, ‘Oh, shes got Harry wrapped around her finger.’”The television presenter added that the decision to step back from their royal duties was likely one made by Harry.But she claims it was easier for the British public to turn on Meghan for the Megxit mess, mimicking the public outcry: “How can he possibly desert us  It must be her.”“Thats the misogyny bit as well. If I can use that term, ‘hes p***y whipped,’ as they call it. I think its racism. I think its xenophobia. I think its misogyny, she’s a strong woman.”Greers explosive claims came as the Duke and Duchess made their first post-royal public appearance.Prince Harry gave a speech at a money summit for an investment bank held at a luxury five-star hotel in Miami.We Meghan was also there for the swanky wealth event — the first time they have been seen together since moving to Canada.Harry told guests at he has been in therapy for seven years, in an attempt to deal with the trauma of losing his mother Diana.It is not yet knownor how much Harry was paid for the event at  Hotel South Beach, though media experts have predicted the couple could make £, for a single speech."},{"url":null,"title":"valentines day diamante ice cream","story":"The diamante ice cream costs a whopping £, and includes a diamond engagement ring, a private feast at their sweet store and a wedding cake.As part of the Valentines Day Special, couples will be presented with their ice cream and handcrafted wedding cake by the characters Hansel  Gretel themselves.But those who want to get their hands on the special diamante ice cream will have to pre-order by Thursday  February to risk breaking hearts on Valentines Day.The Hans  Gretel ice cream parlour is located in bustling Camden Market in North London, and started serving up wacky and wonderful sweet treats in November last year.Their colourful, immersive store is already lighting up Instagram feeds with its giant lollipops and marshmallows hanging from the ceiling.The store includes a selection of pick n mix world candies, a candy floss station and a range of exciting pastries and waffles to tempt those with a sweet tooth.Linda Lim, Co-Founder of Hans  Gretel, UK said: “The Valentine’s Day exclusive dessert is utterly magical.What better way to propose to someone with a real sweet tooth.I take pride in the space we have managed to create, which allows everyone to immerse themselves in their childhood.

But providing it does so through democratic means only, that should not upset many people.After all, it is up to the people of Northern Ireland, through a referendum, to decide whether they want to remain part of the UK or to join Ireland.Sinn Fein can, however, be relied upon to be even more hostile than Leo Varadkar — up until now Ireland’s leader — towards Britain in trade negotiations with the EU.If the party can score some kind of victory by opposing UK proposals, it will do so, making it more likely we will have no trade deal by December .Sinn Fein has used Brexit to its advantage, trying to drive a wedge between Britain and those in Northern Ireland who traditionally want to stay part of the Union.By negotiating a deal which puts some kind of border down the Irish Sea, Boris Johnson’s government has helped Sinn Fein’s cause. Former Irish leader Bertie Aern claimed yesterday that a referendum on a united Ireland will now come before the end of the decade.“I think a border poll is inevitable,” he said. “I think it’s probably five years off at least but the Sinn Fein position is it should be held within five years.”It is easy to see a scenario in which Northern Ireland votes to leave the UK and join Ireland, followed by a Scottish vote for independence.I am not sure where that would leave Boris’s plans for a Belfast to Stranraer bridge, which of course would have been paid for mostly by English taxpayers.All this said, however, there is little to suggest that those who voted for Sinn Fein on Sunday were motivated by concerns over Brexit or by a desire for a united Ireland.Strip away its dubious past and Sinn Fein is now a party of the Corbynite Left — it wants far greater social programmes, all funded by the wealthy.This could have serious consequences in a country whose economic success is founded on low taxes, especially company taxes. Ireland’s corporation tax rate is just . per cent, compared with  per cent in the UK. That has helped it become a magnet for investment.In terms of GDP per head, Ireland was poorer than the UK  years ago, but now it is signicantly richer.But whatSinn Fein was able to do what Jeremy Corbyn promised to do and soak the rich We might no longer have a Celtic Tiger on our doorstep, but a Celtic Sloth. The likes of Amazon and Google, which have established big presences in Ireland for tax purposes, might want to sht operations to Britain instead.Leo Varadkar had hoped he would be rewarded at the ballot box for holding a tough line in Brexit negotiations, but Ireland’s housing crisis seems to have been a far stronger concern.Ireland, even more so than Britain, has suffered from property booms and busts over the past two decades.Many young people have been priced out of the housing market and are struggling to even rent. Sinn Fein did well because it promised a three-year rent freeze and , new homes.These pledges helped the party — which has dominated Republican politics in Northern Ireland — come out of the margins south of the border and break the duopoly of the two main partiesIt won . per cent of the vote, while Fianna Fail, a socially conservative party, won  per cent, and Fine Gael, the more economically and socially liberal party of Leo Varadkar, won just  per cent.If Ireland had Britain’s first-past-the-post system, it would have been a landslide — Sinn Fein topped the poll in  of the country’s  constituencies.But given Ireland’s system of multi-member constituencies, it is far from guaranteed that Sinn Fein will even be in government at all.Before the election, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael both said they would not go into government with Sinn Fein. They could go into coalition with each other.In fact, Fianna Fail was already propping up Fine Gael in a confidence and supply arrangement. But with Sinn Fein topping the poll, this might prove a more dficult position to hold.Sinn Fein says it is exploring trying to put together a government without either of the main parties.But despite winning the biggest share of the vote, Ireland’s political establishment may yet succeed in keeping it out of power — and away from messing up the Irish economy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Defra is looking much more favourably on  years.“With negotiations with the US fast-approaching, this is a decision that needs to be made.”A government spokesperson said: “Our landmark Agriculture Bill will reform our agriculture policy, putting the interests of farmers and land managers, the environment and taxpayers at its core as we free ourselves from the EU’s bureaucratic Common Agricultural Policy.“As part of this, we’ve been clear that farmers will have a seven-year agricultural transition period to plan ahead and adjust to these changes.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The figures could also change as health chiefs collect better data on cases, deaths and recovery.Professor Neil Ferguson said the estimates did not “reflect underlying dferences in disease severity between countries.“All CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland China is unclear,” he said.There are now more than , confirmed cases of the virus worldwide, with over  deaths.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is especially true in relation to sharing of samples and sequences, Tedros said.To defeat this outbreak, we need open and equitable sharing, according to the principles of fairness and equity.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Allies of Ms Symonds said the PM’s senior advisor is “on thin ice” after reports of a row between them over the upcoming Cabinet reshuffle. She is apparently backing ministers who claim Mr Cummingsapos heavy-handed treatment of MPs, officials and journalists are harming the Prime Minister’s image. One of her supporters said she felt forced into political fights at No because Mr Cummings had been “picking unnecessary fights, all over the place with no clear strategy”. The ally said: “Dom’s erratic behaviour has made the PM’s job more dficult, so Carrie and others have had to step up more. “Cummings is on thin ice with a lot of the people around the PM, and he might find out why people in politics spend so much time making friends.” Mr Cummings reportedly urged the PM to sack Chancellor Sajid Javid and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, who have close links to Ms Symonds, in Thursday’s reshuffle. One Tory MP said: “Dom has managed to p*** off everybody – MPs, ministers and civil servants. He might be brilliant but that’s just not sustainable. It’s absolutely no surprise at all that Carrie is taking the side of her old friends.”  Mr Johnson is said to be against firing Mr Javid but how secure Mr Wallace remains is unclear. Mr Cummings is also understood to be looking to remove several special advisers, some who are close to the PM’s partner. Miss Symonds became a Conservative Party press officer  years ago, was promoted to director of communications in , and worked for John Whittingdale and Zac Goldsmith as well as Mr Javid, before being asked to leave.

MPs shouted “shame” as Home Secretary Priti Patel dashed out of the Commons chamber after Home Office questions today, leaving her junior minister Kevin Foster to field an urgent question on the flight. Labour’s David Lammy, visibly furious at Ms Patel’s departure, directed it to her back, pointedly asking her “as she leaves the chamber” to consider the implications of the long-delayed lessons learned review of the Windrush scandal on the flight.In a furious speech, Mr Lammy asked: When will black lives matter once again  Mr Fosteraposs attitude to the debate was widely condemned, with MPs describing his tone as “dismissive” and “wilfully obtuse.” Wearing a pin badge marking the th anniversary of the Windrush generation, Mr Foster responded to Mr Lammy by theatrically dropping his papers on the despatch box, and declaring: Oh dear. He went on to say of the Labour party that people will think theyaposve not only lost the election, theyaposve lost the plot. The debate came as a legal challenge to the flight could see it grounded at the last minute. Duncan Lewis Solicitors, which is representing  people due to be on the flight, is expected to file the papers at the High Court imminently and have called for an urgent oral hearing on Monday afternoon to discuss the matter. The move comes after the Government insisted it would be pressing ahead with the flight, which is thought to be leaving the UK at .am on Tuesday.  Mr Foster insisted the flight was about criminality not nationality. He insisted nobody on the flight held or had a right to British citizenship. And he appeared increasingly impatient with MPs questioning whether the Home Office was sure of their status - despite the Windrush scandal of less than two years ago. He told MPs: With regard to tomorrowaposs charter flight, the Home Secretary is required by law to issue a deportation order for anyone who is a serious or persistent foreign national offender. It does not matter what part of the world they are from, whether it is the United States, Jamaica, Australia or Canada, itaposs criminality not nationality which counts. But he refused to entertain questions on what crimes had been committed by those on the flight, what their ages were when they came to the UK, whether they had been the victims of trafficking or whether their deportation would split up families. He criticised those raising concerns for the people scheduled to be on the flight, saying the Windrush generation should not be defined by criminals, but “by the midwe who delivered hundreds of babies” and “the person who travelled thousands of miles and worked hard.”  And Tory MP Suella Braverman accused those asking questions of “shrill virtue signalling and faux outrage.Labour’s Diane Abbott noted Mr Fosters “dismissive attitude.”He said: We need to be absolutely certain when we are deporting people in this way that we are clear about their immigration status. SNP immigration spokesman Stuart McDonald said the Governmentaposs action could leave  British children without a father in the country.And Labour’s Clive Lewis said the Windrush scandal was state-sanctioned racism adding: When will the minister understand that this flight must be stopped or on his head be it  Mr Lammy said: I regret the tone which the ministeraposs just responded to this urgent debate. It was two years since there was consensus in this House at the way in which the Windrush generation had been treated in this country. He added: Let me just remind the minister -  people were detained and deported which the Government says it got wrong. On the back of that, , people were denied access to public services, healthcare, pensions, education, all that they were entitled to.  Mr Lammy said in the wake of the independent learning review led by Wendy Williams the Government suspended flights to Jamaica, adding: So the question today is why have they resumed those flights  In light of the scandal of people who arrived in this country as children, how can he guarantee the House that there are not people on those flights who are actually British nationals  And in the wake of the leak where Wendy Williams herself says that you should not be deporting people under the age of , can he confirm that there are people on that flight who arrived in this country aged two, aged three, aged five, aged . Tajay Thompson is one of those facing deportation to Jamaica having served half of a -month sentence in  after being convicted of possessing class A drugs with intent to supply at . Now  and living in south London, he told PA he has no links to the Caribbean nation which he has only visited twice since coming to the UK aged five. I feel like I was born here. Jamaica is not my country, Mr Thompson said as he insisted he was groomed into a gang as a teenager. Itaposs not like Iaposm a rapist or a murderer, Iaposve made a mistake when I was  and itaposs now going to affect my whole le.  Downing Street defended the deportation flight, insisting that those on board were convicted of serious offences. Itaposs correct to say that some of those on board are convicted of manslaughter, rape, violence and drug dealing, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said. It is long-standing Government policy that any foreign national offender sentenced to  months or more in prison should be considered for deportation. A draft of a report commissioned by the Government in the wake of the Windrush scandal recommended that ministers rethink the flights, particularly for those who came to the UK as children.

Dan James - a superstar club MC in China - fled the country over fears of illness as the virus spreads around the globe. He had been living in Nanjing, around  miles from the virusapos deadly epicentre in the city of Wuhan. But Dan was shocked to find no tests as he arrived at Heathrow - despite the pilot announcing a health check on the plane. The -year-old said: I was surprised and concerned at this. I was expecting a military operation with everyone getting swab and temperature tested. But Dan says to his surprise passengers just waited in their seats for  minutes, and then got to collect their bags. There were no procedures in place or health checks, Dan said. I was really shocked, I think itaposs crazy. I know most flights from Wuhan get put straight into quarantine - but because I flew via Hong Kong I seem to have slipped through the net. For my peace of mind, I would have liked there to be some final examination when I got off the plane but there was nothing. Dan, who is back living with his family in Brighton, explained he is concerned for their health.  He said he called NHS  with his concerns - who were equally surprised he hadnapost been checked - and staff told him to monitor his condition.Dan has tried to isolate himself in his family home.Thankfully I feel fine, he added.Five people on the South Coast city have now been diagnosed with the deadly disease. It is thought they have contracted it from a British businessman who recently ed from Singapore described as a super spreader. The businessman and scout-leader Steve Walsh, , today spoke out from his hospital bed, saying he has beaten the deadly infection and his thoughts are with anyone  who may have contracted the virus.He remains in quarantine at Guyaposs Hospital in London, where he told how he had no symptoms until he re-entered the UK. Authorities fear Mr Walsh may have come into contact with hundreds of people - and unknowingly infected at least  between contracting the virus and his isolation. The Department of Health has described the virus as a serious and imminent threat to public health. More than , people have died in China so far, after the disease spread from Hubei province. Most regions have been placed into lockdown, and people have been unable toto work. Dan had been living in China for seven years.  But he explained Nanjing had turned into a ghost town, with people reluctant to go outside in fear of catching the disease. When he left there were  cases in the city, in Jiangsu province, and now there are thought to be around . It was scary, the streets were completely empty, Dan said. On social media there are so many scare stories, itaposs impossible to know what to believe. I had no human contact with anyone. Dan quarantined himself in a deserted hotel, which had locked the front doors. He flew back to Britain in fear on February  after hearing airlines were cancelling flights. He said in Nanjing everyone was given a temperature test, and almost every passenger was dressed in a mask and goggles.

Mandy, from Solihull, West Mids, said: She was only a puppy when we got her and she was extremely slim.

The only level that went up was the level of the floods devastating towns and villages yet again. While Boris Johnson plays Cabinet reshuffle games, the Calder hit record heights, drowning homes and businesses. After the catastrophic inundation of Boxing Day , David Cameron and George Osbornevowed to “spend even more” to save threatened towns and villages. They came and went, and so did the money. First it was £million, and then it was £million and then people stopped asking. Work on flood defences was slow to start, lagged interminably and when the rains came back this week, they were unfinished and unable to cope. The only dference between today and five years ago is the name of the storm: for Desmond, read Ciara. No wonder the folk of Mytholmroyd, Luddendenfoot, Hebden Bridge, Huddersfield and Todmorden are shaking their fists in anger – in between bailing out the dirty river deluge. They were let down again by Tory austerity. The river of money that flowed into the Tory party found no tributary into the flood-hit Calder Valley.  I share their wrath. I was out with sandbags at .am on Sunday when flood water lapped my door. Only hundreds of yards away in Sutton-in-Craven, cars were submerged. The Aire Valley where I live is one long lake stretching for miles, with the railway snaking through on raised embankments. But the line is flooded further down, service is suspended.

Tillie Radford was shocked to discover the living room in her family home had been converted into the perfect slumber-party environment. Five teepees were erected, with doll themed bedding, a lantern and a bunting under each one. The party was the work of mum Sue, , who is currently pregnant with her nd child.  Earlier this year Tillie, nine, had a frame fitted to strengthen her leg after it stopped growing due to an operation when she was just  months old. The slumber-party was thrown in a bid to cheer Tillie up.Speaking in a video posted on the family Youtube channel, Sue said: Today is an exciting day for Tillie, no one knows but us grown-ups.“She had a friend over for tea this week and she’s been desperate for a sleepover for a few months now, but I put it off because she was waking up quite a few times in the night due to pain in her leg. “What she doesn’t know is that she’s got another little friend sleeping over and we’ve got a slumber party for her.  “I honestly can’t wait to see her little face bless her. I just know she’s going to absolutely love it.” In order to set up the comfy snooze zone, Tillie was taken out of the house to pick up a friend. While she was out other members of the family, helped by party business Once Upon a Sleepover, gave the lounge a makeover.  I love it, Tillie exclaimed when she came into the room. When asked by her dad Noel, , what she thought about it, Tillie responded Awesome. The girls hunkered down in their teepeess for an evening of film watching, popcorn and sweets. “They’ve had a Dominoaposs pizza and Tillie was also desperate to get some cookies too, Sue added.  “I’m just going to get sorted and head off to bed. Not that I’m going to get much sleep tonight as I’ll probably be down checking on them.” Sue is close to welcoming her nd child into the world. The mum, from Morecambe in Lancashire, has now entered the th week of her pregnancy and visited a consultant to check on the baby’s welfare. Sue said: She was doing brilliantly. Her head was measuring at  weeks, her leg was measuring at  weeks and so was her belly so she’s doing really well.  “Her estimated weight is lbs oz, which is good because I thought she was smaller. She’s still got time to have a growth spurt and she’s growing really well which is brilliant.” With , YouTube subscribers and a TV show, Brits seem fascinated by the massive family who famously claim no benefits, other than Child Benefit, to raise their family. Instead they rely on father Noel, who was  when the couple’s first child was born, and his bakery.

Sue, , was forced onto the monthly benefit after being made redundant from her job as a nursery cleaner.Desperate to move off Universal Credit, Sue has taken three jobs in order to boost her weekly working hours to  a week.She is now featuring in a new three-part BBC series, Universal Credit: Inside the Welfare State. It focuses on claimants in Liverpoolaposs Toxteth jobcentre, where “work coaches” are thinly-stretched following the closure of two jobcentres and their subsequent merger with Toxteth – where we see a long queue of people when its doors open for business. Sue needs to be looking to get  hours work a week and to regularly attend the job centre, or face having her benefits reduced.  She has been unemployed before, but the new system of Universal Credit has made her feel anxious, reports the Liverpool Echo.“Now it’s all been put into one , you just don’t know where you are at. It’s so hard there are so many things you’ve got to do, it’s just constant pressure.” Viewers will initially see her take a -hour a week cleaning job at a pub in Liverpool. It pays the national minimum wage rate of £. an hour – and Sue tells us: “If I can get  hours more, it’s bye-bye jobcentre!”  But she later describes the job as “horrible” – and says: “There are some dirty people out there. I thought it was men at first, but women are just as bad.” She describes seeing vomit on the toilet floor and having to go into the next toilet to vomit herself. Back at the jobcentre, staff member Alison later tells an interviewer: “There are a lot of people out there who clean toilets who are quite happy about it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus scientists discover wuhan infection","story":"NewsCoronavirus scientists discover why Wuhan infection is spreading so rapidlyScientists have found found the coronavirus can survive for days on surfaces that are frequently touched- especially in crowded Tube stations and hospitalsShareCommentsByMirror:,  FEB NewsThe virus can linger on surfaces for days \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailScientists say the coronavirus can survive on surfaces like door handles and bus or train poles for up to nine days. The virus can linger on surfaces more than four times longer than flu, according to new research from Germany. Its much hardier than common bugs - shedding fresh light on its rapid spread. Surfaces that are frequently touched, like in hospitals or crowded Tube stations, are most likely to be harbouring the highly contagious disease. But the potentially deadly droplets can be destroyed within a minute simply through regular wiping with disinfectants such as Domestos. Corresponding author Professor Gunter Kampf said: In hospitals these can be door handles, for example, but also call buttons, bedside tables, bed frames and other objects in the direct vicinity of patients, which are often made of metal or plastic. In the first analysis of its kind his team pooled data from  previous studies on coronaviruses and their inactivation for a future textbook. It focused on the Sars and Mers coronaviruses and found they can persist and remain infectious at room temperature for up to nine days. The average is four to five days. Prof Kampf, of the Institute of Hygiene and Environmental Medicine at Greswald University Hospital, said: Low temperature and high air humidity further increase their lespan.  The results published in the Journal of Hospital Infection should also apply to the current coronavirus -nCoV, he said. To put this in context flu viruses can survive on hard surfaces and infect another person for  to  hours. Theof time cold viruses can live outside the body is even shorter - usually only a few hours. The coronavirus -nCov, dubbed the Wuhan virus, has already claimed more than , lives - more than the  Sars outbreak in . Both originated in China and virologists say they are genetically close. There is no specic therapy. Prevention is of particular importance in order to stem the epidemic, said Prof Kampf.  Co-author Prof Eike Steinmann, head of the Department for Molecular and Medical Virology at Ruhr-University Bochum, said: Under the circumstances, the best approach was to publish these veried scientic facts in advance, in order to make all information available at a glance. Tests showed disinfectants and bleaches containing ethanol, hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite are most effective. The latter is the main active ingredient in Domestos. Applied in appropriate concentrations they almost completely destroy the pathogenic particles. Prof Kampf said: As a rule, this is sufficient to signicantly reduce the risk of infection. The experts assume the results from the analyses of other coronaviruses are transferable to the latest virus. Dferent coronaviruses were analysed and the results were all similar.

The -year-old, who has not been named, brutally struck Dwayne the Staffordshire Terrier with a hammer and then failed to take him to the vets. Video footage of the scene shows a hammer in the man’s right hand as he chases the Staffordshire Terrier around the backyard. The man swings the hammer and hits the back legs of the dog. Once cornered, the dog is then hit twice with the hammer and can be heard squealing. The dog appears to be held and hit with the hammer a further  times as the man is bent over the animal and the yelps continue. The next time the man is seen in the footage he holds up a piece of wood and strikes it down as the dog squeals. According to witnesses he yelled that the hounds had destroyed his synthetic grass before taking them inside. One of the animals had blood dripping from his mouth. RSPCA New South Wales was contacted, prompting the organisation to send inspectors round with police officers the same day. They found bloodstains on the backyard decking and the two dogs locked inside the laundry room. The officials called a locksmith so they could liberate the animals. Dwayne the Staffordshire Terrier was seized and immediately transported to RSPCA NSW Sydney Shelter for veterinary treatment.  RSPCA Inspectors ed to the property on  November  and cautioned the defendant, who initially denied any wrongdoing. After being told about the video footage, he admitted that he had hit the dog with the hammer. The man ultimately handed the dog over to authorities. A vet found that Dwayne had injuries consisted with blunt force trauma, lacerations to the tongue, facial bruising and a fracture tooth. During his sentencing at Mt Druitt Local Court in NSW, Australia, Magistrate Corry told him: You left that dog in continuing pain as a result of not minor injuries, requiring medical treatment.  “Put yourself in the dog’s positionyou were the subject of an assault. They feel pain. You should reflect on that. After pleading guilty to one offence of committing an act of cruelty and one of failing to provide veterinary treatment to an animal, the man was placed on an aggregate four-month intensive corrections order.He must complete  hours of community service work and exhibit good behaviour, RSCPA NSW reported.

The video, filmed from inside a moving car, sees a mushroom cloud explosion rise into the sky from a substation in Podolsk on Monday afternoon. As a result, operations at  boiler houses in the city,  miles south of the Russian capital, were suspended and a reported , peoplesapos power was cut for an hour.  RBC reports PJSC Moscow United Grid Company ceased its power supply following the explosion, according to the city district administration.The restoration of normal operations of the boiler rooms and the provision of full heating took a little while longer. Dash cam footage shows the moment flames shot into the air during the inferno followed by an ominous black and grey cloud over apartment blocks, of which  were left with no power, it is understood. No reasons were immediately given by officials for the sudden explosion on Monday at what is a major electrical substation in the Moscow suburb - and no casualties were reported in the blast. The incident comes months after Moscowaposs Severnaya thermal plant in Chelobitaposyevo caught fire following an explosion at a gas pipeline next to the plant. The plantaposs operations were halted but the facility itself was not damaged, despite flames soaring  metres above the the building in July last year. In August, meanwhile, a radiation explosion in  Russia that killed at least five people happened during a test of the  nuclear engine of a deadly cruise missile nicknamed the aposFlying Chernobylapos, a leading Moscow journalist has claimed. The existence of the lethal weapon, which allegedly has an unlimited range, was revealed during a speech to senators last year by Russian president  Vladimir Putin.The incident near Severodvink led to a radiation aposspikeapos, according to civilian authorities, but Moscow faced criticism for not releasing a full explanation of exactly what caused the blast.  Respected analyst Yulia Latynina claimed at the time the weapon that exploded was an ultra-modern missile called the Burevestnik. Putin described it as having an unlimited range and a nuclear engine, which fits the sparse information released in the wake of the incident. Russian officials have not named the precise missile involved. It is highly likely that this is the one that exploded, Latynina, a respected columnist, author and radio host, wrote in investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta.

We used to be jealous of what other clubs were doing before but we’re now probably one of the frontrunners.“We’re doing a lot of things other teams are aspiring to do. Because of the money and finance put in, it certainly makes your job a lot easier and helps a long way.“When you’re attracting young players to join the club, you want the kids to come into an elite environment rather than what it was before.“We weren’t bad before but there was no finance to do it properly. Andy Goldie is driving it on and we’ve managed to get to Elite status which is brilliant.“Restructuring the whole thing has meant new faces have come in with new ideas.“It’s about evolving all the time, you can’t just sit and accept it because that’s what was happening  or  years ago.”That said, Bow still believes attitude is what will help players get to where they want to be, citing former United man and Liverpool star Andy Robertson as an example.“That’s one of the biggest things I see with kids that are talented,” he added.“It’s how you install it into them to give that extra %. When you come out the other end of an academy, that’s the bit that will help you.“You need to be disciplined. Even since I played, and it’s changed a lot since then, football’s been like that.“You can’t go out every night, you’ve got to practice things and get the basics right first before you work on your game.“We’re wanting to give them the whole package by putting all the fragments together and glue them so we get better players at the end of the day. vw, px\"  “I’m a great believer in always getting to where you want to go.“You could stay here, play in the first team and,you’re good enough, you could always move.“We’ve had one recently with Banksy .“Andy Robertson is a fine example, to have came from Queen’s Park then come up here.“From us he probably could’ve gone straight to a Liverpool or a higher team but he went to Hull and earned his stripes.“Sometimes they want to accelerate it and get from down at E right up to A straight away, rather than working their way up.“That’s the way it goes sometimes and I’ve seen others like wee Gauldy .“I’d have put my mortgage on wee Gauldy being a success at Sporting eventually but, unfortunately for him, things turn out dferent ways.“He’s still playing in Portugal, of course, but he was the one I thought would’ve kicked on.“If I’d looked at Andy and Gauldy back then I’d have probably said Gauldy was the better player. It says a lot about Andy’s character as well and his real drive and determination.”Not everyone can be Andy Robertson, though, Bowman concedes.“I always think the Dutch are a brilliant example because even when players leave the likes of PSV and Ajax, they’ll go where.#Whereas, sometimes in Scotland they’ll drop out of academies and then football altogether.“We’d like to see those boys progress and keep playing as well. That’s a big part of my job, too.“I hope that when they come in full-time with us, they’ll aspire to be players at one level or another.“They’ve just got to show what they’re about.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Their health suffers and the prospect of developing economically remains out of reach. For women and young girls, the consequences can be even worse, with many being attacked and raped when they use outdoor spaces.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Fulmar got off equal first with half a dozen others and the Bosun, at the tiller, is reported to have had a look of near terror on his face. If he had known that one of the yachts, Sinbad, had lost its rudder during the melee and was virtually out of control he would probably have been more frightened. Two boats, Islay and Saionara, were in trouble with burst and torn mainsails. Fulmar held her position well and was among the first half dozen boats up to Colintraive but thereafter the wind fell light and they got stuck in the south narrows and nearly all the boats passed them – those taking the north channel scoring very decisively.Down the Kerry Kyle they recovered some of the lost ground but when they rounded Ardlamont they were still well down in the tail. They passed through the Skate and this paid handsomely as they got a tremendous lt up the east shore and passed boat after boat – those out in the middle of the loch got stuck and never got going again. Seewolf was lying rd or th at the Skate but she crossed the line a very bad last of the whole fleet. A spell of very calm weather followed while Fulmar was away over at Kilfinnan but, a light air coming away, they managed to cross over to the west shore and there got quite a nice little breeze which brought them along splendidly till they reached the buoys south of the breakwater then it died – absolutely. And it took them half an hour to do the distance.Next day, in a strong easterly, they had a slow and strenuous trip through the canal to Crinan then, borrowing Davie Weston’s dinghy to save launching their own, they went straight out and anchored off the canal entrance.There was a straggling start at .am on Monday owing to there being no gun and no one quite knew when to go but followed Arcturus when she gave a lead. Fulmar was moderately well placed about the middle of the ruck. A quite steady easterly gave them a quick passage to Fladda but, off Sheep, it fell light and all were becalmed. This, of course, suited Fulmarfine as no one was moving and, as long as this was the case, she was piling up a fine credit balance of handicap minutes. She tried to keep as well up to the eastward as possible but did not quite succeed in passing east of Sheep island as Arcturus did .A puffer coming south with her smoke trailing away to the west gave them a hint which few,any, of the others took and they held more and more to the east and, as a consequence, got the first of a fresh easterly breeze and swept past boat after boat, most of which had held down to Mull. By the time they got to Duart and were able to bring the breeze dead astern they were well up in the first half and well ahead of their time allowance. Thereafter it was just a question of #Would the wind hold # Provided it did so they felt they had an excellent chance as, with the hold-up at Sheep, they had accumulated more than half an hour of handicap from the leading boats and had lots in hand for those but a little ahead of them.The wind did hold and Fulmar won the Tobermory Cup and the st prize for the second section of the race which with Saturday’s second prize made a very good showing for the weekend.The Mate, Tar and Skipper, were following the race as best they could from the shore. When they came down Loch Fyne side it was a dead calm and they were very surprised when they got to Tarbert to see the boats, half hidden in the rain, coming round Ardlamont – they had no inkling of the breezy start. In Loch Fyne they watched the very slow progress, then the rain cleared off and they were glad to see the big lt Fulmar got up the east shore after going through Skate. For the last two or three hours things went desperately slowly till late-ish in the evening a little breeze brought in the leading boards but it died and left Fulmar no further from the finishing line than the buoys south of the breakwater – she was well up and ahead of several in the big class and most of the small class. She had only about  yards to do when she stopped and, after hurriedly working out the elapsed time handicaps, the Skipper found she had  minutes in which to do them but she failed by a little over two minutes to do it. The Skipper thought she had won as he thought Vanda had been the leader up till then and it was a disappointment when, checking up, he discovered Sally of Kames was ahead of Vanda and had saved her time by two minutes on Fulmar.The start from Crinan was at .am and the Skipper, Tar and Mate got up at .and went across to see them go. The start was a bit of a fiasco as the officials slept in but all the boatsgot off more or less together. As it happens it was perhaps a good thing as, with all the boats starting together on a short line and with the strong easterly breeze that was then blowing there might, too easily, have been some nasty accidents.The Tar, Skipper and Mate went back to their beds then after breakfast went to Oban with little expectation of seeing anything more of the boats. Again they were surprised when, on going to the summit of the Pulpit Hill in Oban, they saw the leading boats just coming up to Duart – they did not know anything of the hold-up at Sheep.Anxiously they watched a number of boats come into view round a hill on Kerrera and were more than pleased when, well up amongst the leaders and passing boat after boat as they watched, they saw the red gaff sails of Fulmar reaching up the Firth of Lorn then running up the Sound of Mull. They watched until most of the boats were well out of recognition distance up the Sound then went home confident thatconditions remained as they were Fulmar had more than a good chance of winning that leg of the race and, with luck, the whole thing.Extract from The Glasgow Herald of Tuesday, July : #Clyde Cruising ClubIn the early hours of yesterday morning the yachts of the Clyde Cruising Club set off from Crinan on the nd leg of their face from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory. The first part of the race ended at Ardrishaig, after which the yachts went through the Crinan Canal.The winners at Ardrishaig were:-Class . st Sally of Kamesh m s.nd Fulmarh m srd Vandah m sExtract from the Glasgow Herald of Monday, July :-Clyde Cruising ClubThe  yachts which raced from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory under the burgee of the Clyde Cruising Club got a rare dusting and with as much wind as they wished the bigger boats came into their own. The  ton cutter Fulmar, which distinguished herself many years ago as one of the few finishers in a stormy Fastnet race, won the Tobermory Cup for the large class, and the  ton sloop Trefoil captured the Torridon Cup for the small class.Driven hard from Port Bannatyne by a fresh easterly, the yachts found a calm patch off Ardrishaig, but they were blown through the canal to Crinan, where the second leg of the race was sailed in a good easterly breeze, resulting in fast passages.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this.

They have no rivals. But it shouldnrsquot be this way.It doesnrsquot matter that independence has been at the heart of SNP philosophy since the partyrsquos inception. At this stage of the nationrsquos history, to permit one party to control the narrative around the future of Scotland is to fatally wound the way our democracy should work. Independence needs a plurality of voices and of thought. A singular, clunking, hierarchical party machine isnrsquot fit for such a momentous task.But praise where itrsquos due, the SNPrsquos great success is the journey itrsquos taken from the fringes of political le to representing the status quo. Part of that great success was changing the narrative around independence. Like the party, the issue of independence moved from the outer limits of politics to centre stage.Today, itrsquos independence which will probably decide how a citizen casts their vote in Scotland. This creates a dangerous warp in the fabric of our democracy, however. Many voters, who see independence as their prime political ambition, hold the SNP to lower standards than they would any other party.They turn a blind eye to the partyrsquos failings because the SNP is seen as the only vehicle which can achieve independence. You donrsquot shoot your own horse when itrsquos in a race ndash you cheer it on at the top of your voice.The SNPrsquos enmeshment in the Yes movement works like a force field, protecting it from flak and scandal that would destroy any other party.This is great for the SNP but not so much for Scotland. The SNP record on health, education, policing, drug deaths, homelessness and economics, is increasingly poor, yet it just keeps dodging bullets. That big Yes badge on the partyrsquos lapel keeps it safe. The Saltire has become a political bullet-proof vest.Even damaging scandals seem to have little effect. The Derek Mackay story wonrsquot fatally wound the party. Therersquos been much talk of the Mackay case spelling the beginning of the end for the SNP. It wonrsquot. Voters who want independence will take the shame and the scars and move on.However, the Mackay scandal will have negative political fall-out for the Yes movement. The great damage done is in the eyes of undecided voters and soft No voters, the swithering centre ground of the constitutional debate. The SNPrsquos increasingly alienating and uninspiring behaviour will deter those most needed to win independence. New voters wonrsquot be gained.Of course, the SNP is hammered in the Unionist press. But there are Nationalist journalists who make no bones of their bias too. One commentator said before the last election that theyrsquod not be making any criticism of the SNP until votes were cast and the party assured victory. It all feels a little incestuous on both sides. What we need is impartial debate for the good of the country.So the SNP gains from its controlling stake in the Yes movement, while the Yes movement is tarnished with the behaviour of the SNP. Thatrsquos the bottom line.This isnrsquot just a post-Mackay and pre-Salmond trial concern ndash this issue has been festering for years and rotting away inside the Scottish body politic.Reporting which holds the SNP Government to account is dismissed as an attempt to hamper the cause of independence. The net result  The SNP dodges proper accountability. If any other another party was in government, such scrutiny would be lauded for holding power to account. Thatrsquos no longer the case among a section of independence supporters. That wounds democracy.Perhaps, the best route out of this democratic dilemma is for an umbrella organisation like the old Yes Scotland to rise from the grave. We need to have a clear iding line between the SNP and the broader Yes movement.The SNP needs to be held to the same set of standards as other parties. It needs voted in and out of office according to its record. Itrsquos now becoming detrimental to good governance for the SNP to be able to continually hide behind independence.Similarly, a Yes movement set apart from the SNP machine, could represent independence without the issue being contaminated by party politics. This is in the best interests of Yes voters ndash of whom, Irsquom one.Why would I want an issue I believe in ndash in this case independence ndash made unnecessarily grubby by a political party  And why would I want the issue I believe in to be used as a shield by a political party ndash in this case the SNP ndash to prevent it being properly held to account Of course, the old Yes Scotland organisation, which shut up shop after the last independence referendum, had plenty of influential SNP members. But it was run by Blair Jenkins, a senior broadcaster not a politician, and Dennis Canavan, a former Labour MP who became an independent MSP.Yes Scotland didnrsquot feel asit were merely an adjunct to the SNP, intended to aid a party political machine. It felt like an organisation arguing for independence in a way that was best for the people of Scotland.This is why the debate around independence has become so toxic. All those old organisations which campaigned in , like Women for Independence or National Collective, represented ordinary folk making their voices heard. They did so mostly without bitterness or rancour.These citizensrsquo organisations operated by trying to win undecideds around with persuasion. Now that the debate around independence has been left to the career politicians itrsquos stagnated into ugliness ndash because thatrsquos what politics is: people are in it for power, money and ego. Thatrsquos not what the Yes movement was ever about, nor what Scotland needs.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11009892.jpg?type=article-full","title":"safer-internet-day---make-going-online-safe-simple-tips","story":"This is an International day celebrated in over  countries with the theme: Together for a better internet.

In ,  people died after a fire broke out in the trans-alpine road tunnel at Mont Blanc.

I remain to be convinced its even possible.\"Labour peer, Andrew Adonis, the Governmentrsquos former infrastructure tzar, tweeted a reference to Mr Johnsonrsquos failed Garden Bridge project in the UK capital when he was London Mayor: ldquoSo now Boris wants to build a garden bridge all the way to Belfast. If you think HS has problems, multiply by  and ide the benefits by .The shipping industry also had qualms, suggesting a new Irish Sea link could threaten the livelihoods of ferry operators.A UK Chamber of Shipping spokesman said the industry supported any initiative to improve trade and tourism links.ldquoHowever, there are already a range of ferry operators taking tourists and trade between Northern Ireland and Scotland. Spending poundbn to poundbn of taxpayersrsquo money on a bridge simply to replicate what those ferries already do is unnecessary. The money could be far better spent improving road and rail links to our ports across the UK.Asked about the prospect of a Boris Bridge, the Prime Ministerrsquos spokesman pointed out how Mr Johnson had suggested the idea ldquocould have some merit, so people should expect the Government to be looking into it.Downing St officials have begun working with others across Whitehall in a ldquoscoping operation, the details of which would be presented to Mr Johnson to seethe scheme should proceed further.In  when the PM first broached the idea of a bridge across the Irish Sea, he said: ldquoThe problem is not the undersea Beauforts Dyke or lack of funds. The problem is an absence of political will.\"The spokesman said Mr Johnson was ldquoambitious about infrastructure projects and that a wide range of work was going on to improve connectivity across the UK and, what some have also dubbed the Union Bridge, was one example of it. ldquoA proper piece of work is being carried out into this idea, he explained.Bolstering the Union with infrastructure projects will also be a key theme of the HS announcement. While the go-ahead with be confirmed for the first phase London to Birmingham link, so too will be the second phase continuing it to Crewe and connecting it to West Coast Main Line, which will benefit passengers travelling to Glasgow and Edinburgh.Alongside this, Mr Johnson is expected to confirm funding for so-called Northern Powerhouse Rail, which will incorporate a ldquoCrossrail of the North, as part of his grand plan to ldquolevel up connectivity across the whole of the UK.In a Commons statement, the PM will announce bus services across England will be transformed with simpler fares, thousands of new buses, improved routes and higher frequencies.And he will tell MPs cycle routes will see a major boost with the construction of more than  miles of new, high-quality separated cycle routes south of the border.ldquoLocal transport connections have a truly transformative role to play in levelling up infrastructure across the country, declared Mr Johnson.Daily journeys for work or leisure were about so much more than just getting from A to B they were the key to accessing skilled jobs, boosting businesses and unlocking economic growth.ldquoThatrsquos why improving connectivity by overhauling bus services and making cycling easier than ever is such an important step forward, to make sure every community has the foundations it needs to thrive, he added.But Andy McDonald for Labour said: ldquoHS has been appallingly mismanaged by the Conservative Party, which has failed to deliver a single major infrastructure project on time or within budget.ldquoIf HS is going to get back on track, the project has to be integrated with Crossrail for the North, it needs to be managed as part of an advanced rail network, and it must eventually extend into Scotland so that we remove the need for domestic flights.The Shadow Transport Secretary stressed HS should be run under public ownership. ldquoThat way it is the UK public ndash not private or overseas state-owned companies ndash who will see aon this investment."},{"url":null,"title":"indyref2-going-tories-existential-choice","story":"But it has also created a concern amongst some that there may be long-term damage inflicted on the SNP and the independence movement, with more problems than they are accustomed to simmering malevolently. Mackay. Salmond. Schools. Hospitals. Ferries.This is emphatically not a Government in trouble no party polling consistently above  per cent after  years in Government, and certain to emerge from the next election as the largest party, can credibly be said to be in trouble. But it is a Government enduring a period of policy and internal dficulties the likes of which it has not seen since it replaced Labour as ldquoScotlandrsquos party in .The Scottish Tories are hoping that dficulties turn into crisis, and crisis turns into defeat. They have a vision ndash a hope ndash that the Mackay story, next monthrsquos trial of Mr Salmond, and anything  which emerges now that the media has the scent of sleaze in its nostrils, could create a narrative which might just turn the tide against the SNP.One can be sure that nothing  will. Whilst some Tories see the perceived mounting doubt over the SNPrsquos domestic record as a route to power, most realise that it is nowhere near sufficient to eject them from office. If the SNP is to lose in Mayitrsquoll be a personality issue, not a policy one.What a backdrop for the Scottish Toriesrsquo new leader to take office on Valentinersquos Day, with the top task to avoid a Unionist massacre in just over  months. Barring an upset of Leicester City proportions, that new leader will be Jackson Carlaw.Mr Carlaw is a highly accomplished politician who has acquitted himself well in both of his caretaker stints. He is personable, excellent company in private, and his decency carries into the public sphere, where he treats opponents with a level of respect not entirely replicated across the Parliament. But he has a ruthless streak, as we saw at First Ministerrsquos Questions last Thursday when he went for the First Ministerrsquos jugular on Mr Mackay.He may need that ruthless streak. For he will enter what may quietly but suddenly become the most important year the Scottish Tory Party has had.For whilst the party may be attracted to a campaign based on the perceived policy failings of the SNP, in the real world, and in real politics, there is only one issue at the Holyrood  election, and that is indyref .The Toriesrsquo strategic positioning on a second independence referendum is highly likely to be the key determinant of its success at that election, which would be fine but for one thing they canrsquot agree amongst themselves on what it should be. Not only that, but the positions are becoming so entrenched that I think there is a decent chance agreement will not be found.There are, broadly, two camps letrsquos call them the Ayes and the Noes. They agree one one thing, that the top priority is to stop nationalist parties winning a Holyrood majority. But beyond that, they dfer.The Ayes accept thatthe SNPwin a majority on a clear manesto pledge to agitate for a second referendum, in an election in which everyone understands what they are voting for, then the referendum must be given.They see a persistent refusal to accept the verdict of the Scottish people as a continuation of the failed strategies of the past, whereby London thinks it is ldquowinning by saying no to the SNP, while it is in fact fomenting discord and pushing moderates towards nationalism, repelled by centralisation and a lack of respect for Scotland.More acutely, they see the ldquono to Indyref  strategy as a vote loser. This is counter-intuitive, but with perhaps  per cent of voters committed to voting Conservative, the party is depending on another -or-so per cent of Labour and LibDem-voting Unionists to vote Tory rather than staying put, staying at home, or voting SNP.To attract these people, they need the threat of Indyref  to be on the table. In Decemberrsquos General Election, these Unionists were reassured by Boris Johnsonrsquos guarantee that there would be no Indyref , and accordingly did not feel compelled to vote Tory to stop it. There was no threat, so there was no compulsion. Several MPs lost their seats as a direct consequence.So the Ayes believe that not only is accepting Indyref  after an SNP victory democratically right, it is also electorally smart.But then there are the Noes. The Noes are scarred by the ldquonear miss at the first independence referendum. Although not all accept how poor the  Downing Street campaign was, they know they donrsquot want to do it again. Some are opposed primarily out of a deep pessimism about their chances of winning, but the greater number oppose the concept of Indyref  for the more noble reason that they see the extensive rupture that the issue continues to cause in Scottish politics and in Scottish public le, and they fear a deepening of the ide.They also tend to see the SNP as a party on the way down, and eventually out. They believe thatthey hold firm and create a competent-looking alternative government, the SNP will eventually fizzle out and lose an election, after which the independence issue is dead.They also believe that the ldquono, never strategy gives the SNP more or a problem than it gives them. If the SNP wins a majority in  and the Prime Minister still says no, what is the First Minister to do  She could ldquodo a Catalonia, but everyone knows that she wonrsquot, because she will lose all the international respect and legitimacy which she has worked so hard to build.So, the Noes suppose, the SNP will simply dial up the grievance agenda and double-down on perpetually talking about Indyref . The people will tire, wonrsquot they The fascinating truth of this Tory dilemma is that both the Ayes and the Noes have credible points. Either could be right, in the final analysis.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

The SNP must realise it#s time for radical change, writes Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard.This Scottish Budget is one of the most signicant in years. This year, the Scottish Parliament has the chance to vote for a budget that will deliver the investment Scotland badly needs and bring about real change in our county.In the last few weeks, we have seen the cost of years of mismanagement and timidity. December’s AE waiting times were the worst on record. The number of homelessness deaths in Scotland is rising sharply and the rate is the highest in the UK. Scotland’s schools are slipping down the international rankings and there is to be a full and extensive review of the SNP’s botched implementation of Curriculum for Excellence conducted by the OECD .Unfortunately, while there is so much at stake determining the future of our country, the Derek Mackay scandal has overshadowed much of Thursday’s important debate on the Budget statement. Derek Mackay’s actions are nothing short of predatory and everyone at Scottish Labour sends their support to the schoolboy involved, his family, and the family of Derek Mackay.:Derek Mackay scandal will not bring down SNP - Brian Monteith: SNP urged to ‘remove independence roadblock’ to get budget through HolyroodSuch heinous acts by a man in a position of power and privilege are entirely intolerable. It is right that Derek Mackay has resigned from the Cabinet and it is right that the SNP have removed the whip, but the nature of his actions mean he is not fit to hold public office – he should go and go now.The long-awaited Budget statement, as presented by Kate Forbes on Thursday afternoon, was deeply disappointing. Though not without some positives such as the Scottish Child Payment which I have called for many times, the statement clearly showed the SNP has no intention of breaking with the timidity of the last  years and delivering the investment Scotland badly needs.Yawning financial black holeThat the SNP intends to use its resource-borrowing powers to borrow £ million in order to plug the £ billion financial blackhole is deeply troubling. This is money that must be paid back and the SNP need to come clean with the parliament and the people of Scotland and explain exactly where they intend to make the cuts that would be needed to pay this money back. Throwing good money after bad in order to try to plug the yawning fiscal black hole is not only unworkable, but irresponsible. Scottish Labour is willing to work with the Government, but onlythey commit to free bus travel for under-s that will promote public transport usage and break down barriers to opportunity provide a fair deal for our hard-pressed local authorities and take decisive action in response to the climate crisis.So far, the indication is that the SNP will not commit to free bus travel for under-s nor provide further and higher education with the resources they need after years of under-investment.The Government’s proposals for local authority funding have received deservedly short shrt from councillors and Cosla, whose president, Alison Evison, has said that in reality this Budget means local government faces “a cut to services, a cut to local jobs, a cut to the work councils do to tackle child poverty and respond to climate change”.The Budget as proposed also makes for dire reading on the subject of higher education. After a decade of cuts and neglect, it offers nothing of any substance to Scotland’s universities. Students too, who are now burdened with record levels of debt, have little reason to celebrate this Budget. As the president of the National Union of Students Scotland, Liam McCabe, has said, “Despite the rising cost-of-living, the support on offer to Scotland’s students remains largely unchanged, leaving them increasingly out of pocket and many struggling to get by, especially the most disadvantaged.” Nicola Sturgeon once said “judge me on education”. Well, the NUS have judged her and her Government, and it’s failing marks for the SNP.Tories offer to back SNPThe alternatives to a Scottish Labour-backed budget are either unpalatable or unthinkable. The Scottish Green Party, who have dutully helped pass the last four Scottish Budgets, have rediscovered their environmental zeal and have decided that they cannot back a Budget that has failed to provide a coherent or strong response to the climate crisis and has been described as “… more timid tinkering at the edges” by Friends of the Earth Scotland.The Scottish Tories, who helped pass the SNP’s Budgets between  and , have offered to lend the SNP their support this time around, but on condition that the SNP legislate for lower taxes. The SNP have made it clear that they will not lower taxesand so this scenario, quite apart from the constitutional animus, looks unlikely. The Liberal Democrats have said they will under no circumstances support any Budget proposed by the SNP.The option the SNP has is this: will they join with the Tories in passing a harmful and damaging budget or will they work constructively with Scottish Labour  It doesn’t have to be like this. Over the coming weeks, Scottish Labour will be fighting for the change we want to see and making the case for our transformative policies to the Government. We have a chance to turn the page on years of under-investment and SNP smoke and mirrors. Scottish Labour will fight for our proposals with the courage of our convictions.Our NHS is in crisis, with social care on the brink. Our education system is failing school pupils and leaving students burdened with eye-watering levels of debt. Our planet is on the verge of ecological disaster. This Budget has so far entirely failed to meet the needs and demands of the day. It is high time the SNP had a long, hard look at the contrast between timidity of their proposals and the need for radical change that exists in our society. After  years of SNP mismanagement and timidity, it is time for investment and time for real change.Richard Leonard is the leader of Scottish Labour and an MSP for Central Scotland©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"current facial recognition technology is not fit for purpose say msps","story":"Current facial recognition technology is not fit for purpose and Police Scotland should not invest in it until major concerns are resolved, according to a damning report published today by MSPs.Holyrood’s justice sub-committee on policing has told the force that before introducing the technology, it has to “demonstrate the legal basis” on which it would be used.And the report calls for the Scottish Government to “explicitly regulate” the use of live facial recognition tech, which would cover private companies and the public sector as well as the police.The committee said there were serious issues around compliance with human rights and data protection legislation, and concerns about “bias” in the technology which could discriminate against ethnic minorities and women. Without safeguards in place, MSPs have warned that “any investment in the technology would be unjustiable”.The report also recommends that the Scottish Police Authority and the new Scottish Biometrics Commissioner – when the post is created – review the use of retrospective facial recognition technology to consider the impact of police accessing images held illegally on the UK Police National Database, or on IT systems inherited from legacy Scottish forces, which contain images of people not convicted of any crime.Convener John Finnie said that while MSPs were “reassured Police Scotland have no plans to introduce live facial recognition technology at this time” the committee’s inquiry had made it clear it was “in no fit state to be rolled out or indeed to assist the police with their work.”He added: “Current live facial recognition technology throws up far too many ‘ positives’, and contains inherent biases that are known to be discriminatory.“Our inquiry has also shone light on other issues with facial recognition technology that we now want the Scottish Police Authority and the Scottish Government to consider. Not least amongst these are the legal challenges against similar technologies in England and Wales, and the apparent lack of law explicitly governing its use in Scotland – by any organisation.“So whether this technology is being used by private companies, public authorities or the police, the Scottish Government needs to ensure there is a clear legal framework to protect the public and police alike from operating in a facial recognition Wild West.”Police Scotland has previously outlined its ambition to introduce “live” facial recognition technology in its Policing  strategy. The technology works by flagging up suspects in real time by cross-referencing “live” images picked up by CCTV cameras against police databases.However, the report says that Police Scotland’s assessment that the technology would have “a positive impact on equalities and human rights” stands in stark contrast to the evidence received by the sub-committee.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: “While we support Police Scotland in using technology to keep our communities safe – and technological advances in biometrics have brought huge benefits to police and other justice agencies in detecting, preventing and prosecuting crime – the use of this technology clearly raises a number of ethical and human rights considerations.”“We are determined to ensure that the approach to biometric data used for the purposes of policing and criminal justice in Scotland is not only lawful, but also effective and ethical.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"holyrood needs recall system to give voters ultimate sanction","story":"Voters must be allowed to get rid of #unacceptable# MSPs without having to wait for a Holyrood election, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats has said in the wake of the Derek Mackay scandal.Willie Rennie has urged Holyrood’s Standards Committee to create a recall mechanism to allow electors to trigger by-elections when “serious and harmful behaviour” by MSPs has occurred.He said the Scottish Parliament should introduce powers similar to those in Westminster to sanction MSPs guilty of “unacceptable conduct” and that the people of Renfrewshire North and West have now been left “helpless”, with no way of getting rid of their disgraced MSP.Mr Rennie’s call comes a day after his colleague Alex Cole-Hamilton said MSPs should be subject to PVGchecks as they often had unsupervised access to children, young people, and vulnerable adults. He has asked that the forthcoming Disclosure Scotland Act be amended to cover elected representatives at all levels.Shamed former finance secretary Mr Mackay resigned from the Scottish Government last week on the eve of delivering the budget. He was also suspended by the SNP after it emerged he had repeatedly messaged a -year-old boy in a manner described as “predatory” by opposition MSPs.Pressure is also growing on Mr Mackay to resign his seat, with SNP deputy leader Keith Brown yesterday saying it was “very dficult to see how he can continue”.Yesterday Mr Rennie said Holyrood’s Standard’s Committee should reconsider introducing measures to allow constituents to recall MSPs. “I want MSPs to know that serious and harmful behaviour could lead to the ultimate sanction of them losing their job,” he said. “At the moment voters are helpless when faced with unacceptable conduct such as Derek Mackay using the offer of parliamentary receptions to try to befriend a teenager.”In , the UK Parliament passed legislation to trigger a by-electionmore than  per cent of constituents sign a recall petition. Although the idea was considered by the Scottish Parliament in  – following the resignation of SNP childcare minister Mark McDonald for inappropriate behaviour towards three women – it was rejected by MSPs.“I was disappointed the proposal I made for recall was rejected by the Standards Committee,” Mr Rennie said. “There is merit in looking at this again. It is an ongoing issue and we shouldn’t let it drop.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"uk faces choice between time border or darkness in scotland until 9am","story":"The UK government faces a choice between a #time border# iding Northern Ireland from Great Britain or leaving Scotland without daylight until after am in winter, peers have warned.A House of Lords committee claims the government has “stuck its head in the sand” over EU proposals to abolish daylight savings, with the impact of the Brussels still poorly understood in the UK after years of “hoping that it goes away”.And the Scottish Government has warned thatthe UK felt compelled to follow the EU’s lead, it could add to risks on the road for Scottish schoolchildren and damage the rural economy north of the border.The European Parliament voted last year in support of a proposal that would put an end to the twice-yearly changing of the clocks. Peers have warned that Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal could force Northern Ireland to operate in a dferent time zone to the rest of the UK for half the year, because of a commitment to remain aligned with the EU.“Were this proposalto become EU law under its current single market legal basis, Northern Ireland may be obliged under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement and the protocol on Ireland Northern Ireland to align with the EU and thus institute a time border with Great Britain,” the report by the Lords European Union committee warns.Peers say thatthe EU adopted the measure, it would have “major implications” for the UK, adding: “The nature and signicance of such implications is not, however, well understood– not least by the Government.”Responding to the committee’s inquiry, the Scottish Government said there were “specic socio-economic concerns”daylight savings is abolished, and the National Farmers’ Union Scotland said changes “would have more pronounced implications for Scotland”.“If clocks were not to be turned back an hour in winter, Scotland would have no daylight between am and am and children would face the dangers of travelling to school in the dark,” the Scottish Government said in its submission to the committee. A change is also likely to mean farm and other large vehicles spending more time on the roads during the hours of darkness, further adding to the risks.”Business minister Kelly Tolhurst ruled out having two timezones in the UK while giving evidence to the committee last year, saying: “Anything that would create a time border in Northern Ireland we are completely opposed to, and so is the Irish government.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nafc pair shortlisted in national lantra finals ","story":"Valentina Romano and Jimmy Dakin are in the running for the Lantra Scotland awards.Jimmy Dakin from Sanday in Orkney has been shortlisted as Aquaculture Learner of the Year.

I already knew that the library held old copies of newspapers from previous research but I was unaware of the sheer volume of information available, and the fact that the library holds documents dating back to the early s.The open day allowed members of the public to come in, ask questions, get to know the department and find out how to use the resources to discover their family history and also the story of Ballymena‘ was like years ago’s growth as a town.The Heritage Collection will mean dferent things to dferent people. Some will have a purpose for their search, such as finding a long lost relative or tracing a map of their home area from years gone by. Others will simply visit and get lost in the vast records, pictures and resources on offer.As a bit of a history buff, I was transported back to my university and school days as Daniel Brown, the senior library assistant for the Heritage Department spoke of some of the hidden treasures within the library.He said past records of the old workhouse are available, giving an extraordinary insight into who was actually in the dreaded facility down through the years, and also into the meetings held by some of the officers.We have artefacts dating back hundreds of years. Some are very valuable to us today, such as a complete map of the original Adair estate from  as much can be learned from this. We also have lots of interesting memorabilia including war rationing books and images of the Queens visit to Ballymena after her coronation.Daniel, who has a personal interest in history, really enjoys showing people around the department, whether they be locals or from further afield.He told me: Weve had many tourists come in, especially Americans who are keen to learn more about their ancestry and research old family names. Its interesting looking back and helping people discover where they come from!You can also trace old church history through births, deaths and marriages, communion and membership rolls and even church offerings.It was down this path that I met Mary Carson and Anne McCaughey as they browsed through the pew rental records of Buckna Presbyterian Church dating back to .Both ladies are members of the Broughshane History Society and were looking through the old records searching for ious recognisable names, however their inidual interest in local and family history was not hard to see.Mary spoke about tracing her family tree and how her curiosity was fuelled by seeing two old pictures of her grandparents at her aunt’s house.She followed rthe trail to a local heritage collection where she was able to find out through old newspapers that her grandfather’s death had made front page news many years before.Her search also revealed that a family member she always believed to be her uncle actually turned out to be her cousin!Researching and delving into the past is so interesting in my opinion, and can also be rewarding, Mary told me. I have found out that Im related to, so many people I didnt know about.Anne agreed, and was full of praise for the resources available in the library. She recalled happy times of listening to older family members talk about the past but said it is often not like that today.Today the younger generation dont seem to be as interested. They are busy working on phones or listening to their earphones that they dont seem to care whats going on around them or what has went before, so they are going to have to depend on information and places like this library to trace their past.As I left them to their church history search, my eyes were drawn to the vast arrays of cases containing maps along a wall.Here there are ordnance survey maps from the s right up to the s. There are also Grfith valuation maps for Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry as well as th century town plans and local government maps - it really is a local history lovers dream!There are far too many resources to list, but some that need a mention include the vast photograph collection from around Co. Antrim as well as multiple information packs on local schools, people and places all arranged by location and subject.Two of the special collections housed in Ballymena library is the Langford Lodge Collection and the  census for parishes in Co. Antrim.The Collection Officer for the library is Maria Diamond, who is always on hand to direct the public to what they are looking for.She was keen to point out the many online resources made available by the library, so as your search doesnt have to end when you go home!Family history and researching your ancestry has really taken off in the last few years, Maria told me.Therefore we have listed many online resources that can help people trace their history in their own time, or when the library may be closed.Maria enjoys her job, and said she has noticed an increase in the number of people using the department.We are generally a busy department, and we try to always be on hand to help guide people to their desired field of study.“We also enjoy welcoming groups and school classes to the Heritage Collection and tailor the activities to their age or field of study. We have lots of resources for children, and a wealth of information on the local area and how it was affected during major events in history, such as the two world wars or the famine. Teachers or groups just need to get in touch to arrange a visit.I was thoroughly impressed by my visit to the local studies department.Yes, I knew alot of information was available, however I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources, how far back it dated and the way in which it was displayed.No matter what period you are interested in, or what local area there is sure to be some information that will aid your study.My visit to the Cultural heritage open day may have been for business, but my next visit to discover Ballymena of old will more than likely be for pleasure!

He attended St Mary’s Primary School in Portglenone and St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena.Speaking about his early involvement in music, he said: My parents didn’t play but they sent all of us to music and dancing for years and drove us to lessons and events every night of the week, I owe them a lot for that. They had a keen interest and were very supportive.I was sent to the local Comhaltas Ceoltoacuteiriacute Eacuteireannbranch in Portglenone when I was around .I started tin whistle classes with the late John Kennedy first, then progressed onto the button accordion with Tommy Doherty.My parents then started taking us to The Crosskey’s Inn every week for sessions and I also joined the Comahltas branch there too.That place had a huge effect on me, there were great musicians there of all ages and they really helped cultivate my interest growing up. I still go there when I can.As part of the Crosskeys Comhaltas we won many All-Irelands. We had a great gang at the time along with dedicated parents that were also passionate about the music.Going to the Fleadhs was as much about socialising with other kids in music as it was competing. We got up to all sorts of ilment that I won’t get into here!I started on the tin whistle, moved to button accordion then started to teach myself guitar when I was . I quickly became obsessed with the guitar.Its such a versatile instrument and one that you can literally play or learn any style of music on.From playing the guitar I was able to give a few other stringed instruments a go - bouzouki, tenor guitar, bass, electric guitar.Its not a big stretch to adapt the same skills on guitar over to other instruments, and its nice to have dferent colours available, especially when writing.Sometimes I write on the piano - because I’m not great at playing piano, you’re forced to think dferently and that can work in your favour.In terms of my influences, for the accordion it would be Mairtin OConnor or Dermot Byrne. For the guitar, its harder to narrow it down, but three that stand out are Arty Mc Glynn, Steve Cooney and John Doyle. My own style is probably some hybrid mix of those three.I have worked with Grammy nominated fiddler Liz Carroll, folk singer Karan Casey, Duke Special, Liam O’Maonlaiand Bela Fleck.I am involved with ‘Ulaid’ with John Mc Sherry and Donal O’Connor, and Scottish group ‘Fiddlers Bid’. As a guitar player I regularly work with a lot of other traditional bands including Lunasa, Flook, Buille, and the Mairtin O’Connor Band.BEOGABeoga was formed while Seaacuten was a pupil at St Louis Grammar School.He continued: At St Louis, I was involved with the Traditional Group the whole time I was there.Frank Cassidy directed it and was always very encouraging. We competed in ‘Slogadh’ competitionsand had great craic travelling around to the dferent competitions.Beoga was formed around this time and the teachers were very understanding about me missing days here and there to play gigs.I used to go to the States for these long weekends and be catching up on school work on the plane home.Whilst at St Louis I never actually studied music as an option. I didn’t have a classical background and for some reason never thought it would be a viable career option!Whilst studying for my A levels, I started to become really obsessed with music and decided that was it - I couldn’t even think about doing anything .Up until that point I was looking at careers in IT. I heard about a new course in University of Limerick offering a degree in Irish music, that didn’t require A level music, you just had to go for an interview and perform.I got in anyway and I met Niamh there. We were in the same class and became big pals and she ended up joining the band.She’s an amazing fiddle player and singer and I’m lucky to have found her!ED SHEERANBeoga have been together for around  years and they have been afforded the opportunity to travel the world doing what they love.Seaacuten said: We’ve toured a lot around Europe and North America but have also been lucky to tour in more exotic places like Japan, Australia and Russia. We’re travelling a bit less now, thankfully, but at one stage I was definitely seeing more of the band than my own family.One of the biggest audiences the band have performed to was a , strong crowd at the Glastonbury festival in  alongside Ed Sheeran.Sheeran, whose grandparents hail from the Emerald Isle, is well-known for his love of Irish traditional and folk music, even recording a version of The Parting Glass.He has said that one of his earliest musical memories is listening to the Irish Heartbeat album by Van Morrison and The Chieftains and he is also a fan of The Bothy Band and Planxty. Close friend of the band, Foy Vance, shares the same record label as Sheeran and had been supporting him on tour. They had listened to a few of Beogas tunes on the road, and Ed reached out to the band to help with his album.Seaacuten explained: We went to over to his house in Suffolk for a couple of days. It was all very relaxed, he made everyone feel completely at ease.The weather was amazing so we were outside in the garden a lot. We played on four tracks and two made it to the album so we’re delighted.One of them, ‘Galway Girl’, came about just jamming in the garden outside the studio. He was completely sound, we stayed in his house and had a few beers and even played a game of football at one stage.Working with Ed has presented a lot of new opportunities to play and write with other artists.Our friend Foy Vance was the guy responsible for introducing us to Ed. We’ve written a good few songs with Foy now and will hopefully keep creating more with him, he’s an amazing singer and an even more amazing songwriter and is finally being recognised as such.We’ve also worked with Johnny McDaid on the songwriting and production side of things, although he’s been crazy busy since Snow Patrol started touring again.Just recently we’ve been writing a bit with Cormac Neeson from ‘The Answer’. The collaborations are really exciting to me, you just don’t know whats going to come out of a writing session but that buzz of finishing the day with a song is a real high.Seaacuten believes there is a great local traditional music scene stating: I think traditional music is stronger than ever.He encourages all age groups to get involved and give it a try, commenting: If I had any advice, it would be to not to get too worked up about competitions and instead focus more on the social side of the music.While competitions can be good to focus on something, it can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on kids.In his rare free time, Seaacuten has a purpose built recording studio in Portglenone called Bannview Studios.He has been recording for about  years and recently moved into his current space about five years ago.He said:I regularly engineer and produce other artists here, so that keeps me busy outside of the bands schedule.Beoga will be releasing a new album in the Spring. It will include singles released over the last few months along with some new songs and instrumentals that the group have been working on over the last year.Beogas latest release is called ‘Make a Mark’ and features Co. Down singer Ryan Mc Mullan.

I’ve written about music and been to a lot of concerts over the years. The list below is typical of the tracks that stand out in my memory. I haven’t mentioned the Small Faces or Bruce Springsteen, SLF or other old favourites. I like to hear a lot of contemporary music too. Starchild and the New Romantic for example - a NY soulster I came across last week. Locally, Brand New Friend from Castlerock, are an outstanding punk pop sound. Anyway, here goes…!. Town Called Malice - The Jam. Laser eyed social poetry from Weller, tight Tamla baseline from Foxton and finger clicking rhythm from Buckler. Classic mod. . The Highest Apple - Runrig. Spiritual Scots Gaelic song. Our wedding dance, along with Van the Man of course,  years ago. . This Beautul Day - Levi Jackson. I used to be a Northern Soul DJ and had quite a collection of original vinyl singles. I love the genre still. This track has it all: dance, clear gospel uplt, a black civil rights cry for hope. It’s worth hundreds. I once tried to buy it on eBay behind my we’s back. Thankfully the bid didn’t make it. Confession is good for the soul. . Kennedy - The Wedding Present. Indie student guitar based noise. Great band live from the late s. Still going. Much the same as Copper Blue by Sugar - another favorite indie band.. Live Forever - Oasis. Slightly later and closer to the football culture of which I was a part in my youth. I interviewed them twice for music fanzines before they were famous. Influenced greatly by the Stone Roses - another favourite band. . At Least That’s What You Said - Wilco. Existential American alternative musings. Another great band live. Profound sentiments from Jeff Tweedy.. So Danco Samba - Stan Getz. Much into jazz as I’ve aged. I love Mile Davis up to the late s. This track is gentle samba. Relaxing.. Prelude to Cello Solo No.  in G Major- Pierre Fournier. One of the most moving pieces of music I’ve ever heard. I feel unworthy when I hear it. It touches the eternal. . In the Hours - Emily Deloach, Incredible Grace. I listen to Christian praise a lot, it comes with the calling. This track oozes gratitude for the Gospel. Always make me thankful. I love City Alight songs and a Presbyterian praise group called Red Mountain.. Dig a Little Deeper - The Watson Twins. Smoky, sultry, southern Americana. Played this song driving through mid State Tennessee last year. Right song in the right place. Something like Lucinda Williams or Gillian Welch.

The line will be open from am – pm Monday to Friday.The contact line is for use by three priority vehicle groups which include four year old cars due their first MOT, taxis and car dealerships. These groups are unable to avail of a Temporary Exemption Certicate being issued to other car and light goods vehicle owners.Speaking as the contact line opens, DVA Chief Executive Paul Duffy said: “DVA is continuing to work to contact priority vehicle owners as quickly as possible, however we do not have contact details for all of these customers.“We are therefore asking anyone with a four year old car due its first MOT, taxis and local car dealerships with vehicles due a test within the next two weeks to contact us on  , so we can move your appointment forward. Please state clearly when the vehicle test is due and have your booking reference to hand. This line will continue to be open to all relevant customers within the priority groups who need an urgent appointment within two weeks from the time of the call. “DVA can only bring an appointment forward after a booking has been made on the system, so it is essential that customers continue to make a booking when they get a reminder letter.”DVA continues to do everything possible to resume normal operations and two new vehicle lts are now in operation in Belfast and Newbuildings, increasing capacity at these sites. Three existing lts in Belfast and Lisburn have been independently inspected and are back in operational use. Two independent reviews announced by the Minister for Infrastructure have also now begun and an initial report in relation to the status of existing vehicle lts and any repair work necessary is due shortly. DVA would like to remind owners of cars of five years and older whose tests have been cancelled by the DVA, that they will automatically receive a Temporary Exemption Certicate , thereby enabling them to continue to drive and tax their vehicle.TECs are also being automatically issued to owners of three year old light goods vehicles. Testing of heavy goods vehicles, buses, motorcycles and re-tests remains unaffected by the current disruption and those customers should continue to attend appointments.Customers should continue to book an MOT when they get their reminder letter. This will ensure that, should DVA need to cancel the test later, a temporary exemption certicate can be issued automatically. Bookings can be made online at www.nidirect.gov.uk services book-motvehicle-test-online by ringing the booking line on    or in person at a Test Centre.The public can get more information at www.nidirect.gov.uk mot-latest  "},{"url":null,"title":"people  ","story":"Having secured what she describes as her dream job Wendy Walker was determined to perform her duties as a police officer in Northern Ireland for a full term of  years.

However, a letter’s been sent to the family home asking her to “contact a monumental sculptor” to “make this memorial safe”.A family member – who prefers not to be identied – told us about her upset when she opened the letter.“It was a bit of shock, to be honest,” she said. “Everyone can make mistakes, but this is one that could so easily have been avoided with a bit of sensitivity and professionalism. City Hall keeps records of deaths, so obviously nobody bothered to do any cross-checking. And it would be a very simple matter for the workers inspecting the headstones to take a note of who’s in the plot as an extra precaution. Manynot most of the graves in the cemetery are family plots and somebody should have taken that into consideration before this process started. It’s just a lack of thought and care, in my opinion, and it was totally avoidable.“I would ask them now just to do what they can to make sure their process is tightened up to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen to any more families. I’m sure it’s happened before and it will certainly happen again unless the system is improved.”Like many local authorities across the north and in Britain, Belfast City Council is in the midst of a memorial inspection programme launched in  after an eight-year-old boy was killed by a falling headstone in Scotland the previous year.In the letter to the local family, the City Hall Director of City Service said while the Council does “not wish to cause any further upset” to bereaved families, it must “make sure” its cemeteries are “safe places” for workers and visitors.In a statement to the Andersonstown News, A Belfast City Council spokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for the upset and hurt caused to the family. As part of our memorial safety inspection started in , we have written to around , deed holders. Some of the information we hold may not have been updated by relatives or family members, hence this administrative error has occurred. We recognise this will have been very upsetting for those receiving the letter and apologise for the error.”But the family member rejected any suggestion that families should be required to update information about their loved ones for the Council. All deaths in the city are legally required to be registered with Belfast City Council, which also holds burial records for the City Cemetery.“The death was registered with City Hall,” she said. “They have the information at their fingertips and that is enough. The simple fact of the matter is that they made no effort to access that information and are just sending out letters willy-nilly to deed-holders, most of whom are going to be older people.

It would mean that Northern Ireland would follow summer time hours, even when people in Great Britain wind their clocks back by  minutes in the autumn. Peers have suggested that any EU sht in timekeeping might mean that Northern Ireland will have to follow suit due to the terms of the Prime Minister#s deal.Were this proposal to become EU law under its current single market legal basis, Northern Ireland may be obliged under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement and the protocol on Ireland Northern Ireland to align with the EU and thus institute a time border with Great Britain, said the report.The group of cross-party peers have called on the Government to give urgent further consideration to the impact the Brexit agreement could havethe EU does decide to make the summer time switch permanent.Our inquiry has demonstrated that any such decision at EU level would have implications for the UK, notwithstanding UK withdrawal from the EU, wrote the peers.Business minister Kelly Tolhurst, giving evidence to the committee last year, said: Anything that would create a time border in Northern Ireland we are completely opposed to, and so is the Irish Government.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDUP#s Wilson claims #Sinn Fein are useless in government# after spectacular poll success in Republic Ex-Rangers owner Whyte claims DUP offered him peerage for £kAngry exchanges in Stormont as Sinn Fein#s Murphy is challenged over Paul Quinn controversyIrish election  result a #slap in the face# for Leo Varadkar, says Ian PaisleyJamie Bryson wants DUP chief Johnston as NAMA trial defence witness,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Speaking at a government event on Monday, the Cabinet minister said traders from the EU and GB would have to submit customs declarations and be liable for checks at GBs borders from the end of the Brexit transition period on December , . Colum Eastwood said any trade barriers with the EU would see Northern Ireland businesses face new financial, logistics and supply burdens. He called on the government to introduce measures to protect businesses from any disruption to trade.Mr Gove said that it could take up to five years to get a smart border involving online processes up and running and warned businesses to be ready for the changes by next January.The plans are aimed at GB EU traders and do not apply to the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and Ireland or between Northern Ireland and GB. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson#s Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU says that checks and controls will be required on goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland that go on to the Republic, effectively creating a border in the Irish Sea.Mr Johnson said the only circumstances in which he could see the needs for checks would be on goods travelling from GB to NI and on into the Republic of Irelanda zero tarf, zero quota trade agreement had not been reached with the EU.Foyle MP Eastwood said Mr Gove#s plan would create unnecessary and politically motivated barriers to trade that will damage Northern Ireland#s economy.He said the government#s rush to abandon the EU rules would have severe implications on trade to Northern Ireland from GB. Mr Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and de facto deputy prime minister, said that as GB would be outside the single market and customs union the country must prepare for the customs procedures and regulatory checks that will inevitably follow.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eeea-be-d-afd-fbb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eeea-be-d-afd-fbb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eeea-be-d-afd-fbb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eeea-be-d-afd-fbb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eeea-be-d-afd-fbb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eeea-be-d-afd-fbb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eeea-be-d-afd-fbb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eeea-be-d-afd-fbb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAs a result of that we will be in a stronger position, not just to make sure that our economy succeeds outside the European Union but that we are in a position to take advantage of new trading relationships with the rest of the world, he told the Government#s Border Delivery Group.In relation to businesses Mr Gove said they have to accept we will need some friction.We will minimise it, but it is in an inevitability of our departure, he told the event.I don’t underestimate the fact that this is a signicant change, but we have time now to make that change.Mr Eastwood said the government had moved away from promises of frictionless trade and borders of the future.He accused Mr Gove and the government of not caring about the effect the plan would have on businesses and the economy.Their rush to reject alignment with EU rules isn’t based on creating new opportunities or doing what’s best for business here, it is an entirely political decision rooted in the Europhobia that has gripped the British Government, the Foyle MP said.“The effect of insisting on trade barriers with the EU is that businesses here that rely on GB market supply for component parts or for access to freight, for example, will face new financial, logistics and supply burdens. We know that the impact of new burdens on SMEs will be signicant.“The British Government understands the impact this will have on our economy. They have been engaged with the North’s trade and industry experts. Their disregard for the experience and advice they’ve received is astonishing.The SDLP leader called on the government to introduce measures to protect businesses from the fallout of the plan. “Our economy cannot be collateral damage. The British Government needs to be prepared to offer specic derogations from these new rules for local business.

The most recent Performance Improvement Report, issued in November, indicates that the Council has not performed to the standards expected or addressed the serious issues confronting it. Information from the Northern Ireland Audit Office has confirmed Causeway Coast and Glens is performing well below the other  councils.“This cannot be ignored by elected representatives and this is why we called for the appointment of independent consultants to examine root and branch the senior workings of this council.They continued: “As elected representatives, we are required to adhere to a code of conduct based on the  principles of public le. Principally, we are servants of the public and stewards of public resources.We have a moral responsibility to our constituents to take control of the situation, to correct it and to ensure that it does not happen again. We also have an obligation to demand openness and transparency.The SDLP group concluded: “The harsh reality is that this Council is at financial breaking point and is quickly losing the trust ofthe public. This huge debt is seen by an increasing number of people as poor management and we need to recty that.“We are delighted that our motion was passed to call in independent experts to meticulously detail what the problems are and more importantly, what the long-term solutions are. Only then will it be able to regain the public’s confidence”.A motion, proposed by Sinn Feacutein Councillor Cara McShane on the appointment of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancyinto Causeway Coast and Glens was also passed on Tuesday.The council agreed to appoint CIPFA and to defer any decision on rates ahead of the legal timeframe of  February.They said this was to allow CIPFA to make recommendations, report to members and work with council to prepare a medium term financial plan and financial resilience review. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was a great era.You had to go out that was the only way to meet up, you couldnt bring a girl round to the house.Youd have to go to the pictures or go for a walk.The smitten couple went to great s to see each other because Mr Boyle lived in Lishally while his sweetheart was from the city.We walked everywhere so we used to go out with our dancing shoes under our arm, said Mrs Boyle.Very few people had cars and a night out could involve all manner of transport, especiallyyou were going to Borderland in Muff.Myra got the bus to Enagh Lough and I would walk her in to the Red Cross Bar and then we would get the boat across from Lisahally to Culmore and then walk from Culmore out to Borderland, said Mr Boyle. googletag.cmd.push Jimrefused to let living out in Lisahally get in the way of his social le.I used to stick my galoshes [waterproof shoes] in a hedge and pick them up on the way home, he recalled.I got a lt on a motorbike a few times and I went on the back of lorries with pigs in them.It could be scary walking down the Lough Road at night because it was pitch black.I used to say youll never see anybody as long as you walk backwards.You had to know every street in Derry too.Becauseyou offered to walk a girl home you had to know how far it was going to be.The Derry girls were well known for their sense of style and were always impeccably dressed.They were always very well turned out, said Mr Boyle.The Derry ladies were always dressed up.Especially at the Embassy. Even the bouncers at the Embassy wore a tabby bow.Thats the only thing that has changed is the dress, said Mr Boyle.In those days you wouldnt have got in without a collar and a tie.You had to get all dressed up and the bands would be all dressed up too.There was no turning up in jeans and a oul top.You used to see the girls walking around on a Friday with their curlers in.Sometimesthey asked you out they would say no, Im washing my hair.That was a handy way of refusing.Dancing was a big thing for people of all ages in the city and most of them were self taught.You might have had an older sister who would show you the steps, or you would teach yourself pushing off a door handle, said Mr Boyle.Mr and Mrs Boyle both recall the excuse me dances where someone could cut in and take your partner.It was mostly your mates who would cut in, Jim recalled.You had to rescind to them and give them your lady friend.There were strict rules about the style of dancing too and how close you could get to your partner.You werent allowed to jive unless it was a jive session, and you couldnt dance too close to your partner, said Mrs Boyle.The parish priest would come along and tap you on the shoulderhe thought you were too close, whether you were married or not.A girl could get a tap too. I remember getting one at the Whitehorse when we were married.And the couple, who have been wed for  years, have no intention of hanging up their dancing shoes any time yet.We cant stop now we would seize up, joked Mrs Boyle.Its much better than sitting in the house, agreed Mr Boyle. The doctor should put it on prescription, dancing gets you out and exercising and talking to people. googletag.cmd.push If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In the second half we werent clinical enough. We should have been finishing that game with -, - at our ease. googletag.cmd.push “We played much better last week than we did this week. Its old school tradition but I felt we didnt get enough blocks on last week, we didnt put enough pressure on the ball going in and today we did that much better and thats probably resulted in Tipp being held scoreless from play.”Gallagher admitted that the uncertainty in the build up to the game was not at all helpful, with the Derry boss expecting the game to be postponed after witnessing the rain at Celtic Park on Saturday night.“In the morning we probably felt that it wasnt going to be on,” he said. “It was a bit of a lottery and you could see the way it cut up there. To be brutally honest I stayed up last night and witnessed the rain. “We were up at the Brunswick and the kids were coming out and it was absolutely baltic and the rain was coming in.“In fairness the pitch improved and to be fair thats part of the challenge of being a sportsman or athlete because you have got to be mentally strong and to be fair the lads started the game strong and that didnt seem to impact them.”Yesterdays game was certainly not the most entertaining nor memorable of games, but for Gallagher and his players it was all about the result.“When it was -, - you would like to have seen us push on but to be honest I thought there were one or two soft frees again,” he continued. “We didnt push on but we overplayed the ball and dropped a couple short and maybe Alex had a couple of shots we missed and we had Sammysgoal chance and we had Dannyschance.“Those things, maybe instead of stretching the game out to -, or  or  points maybe leaves it a wee bit more nervy than it should but I suppose the boys are saying that we havent beaten a team ranked like Tipperary in a couple of years so it probably leads to a wee bit of fear.” googletag.cmd.push Important After disappointments of ious natures against Leitrim and Down, yesterdays win was important for Derry in the short term as well as in the bigger picture.“We need to have an open mind,” Gallagher continued. “We want to be better at the end of the league than we were at the start. Thats the approach we have taken because we are with a new group and we are trying to build a consistency here.“Im not from Derry but looking in from the outside the turnover in players, the in and out of the squad, the lack of consistency in selection, the lack of togetherness probably, were really trying to build on that.“We think the age of the squad is really, really good there and we know theres good talent thats come through in Derry but its a matter now of sticking together. Its a test of character and generally the people who are mentally toughest and the strongest characters win out.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things.

Leo Doherty, an Upper-Sixth pupil at Lumen Christi College, has won first prize in the Intermediate Category of the British Council’s Mandarin Speaking Competition, which was held at the Victory Service Club last Wednesday. His win follows on from that of Thornhill Colleges Eve Flood, who took the beginners’ title last year. The competition aims to build interest in Chinese language and culture and saw Leo joined by students from  Secondary Schools from across the Britain – including fellow pupilsAnitta Sibin, who competed in the Beginners’ Category, andMatthew Rodgers, Niamh Fleming, Grace Martin, Vibhav Nthanankalva and Owen McFadden, who performed in the Group category. googletag.cmd.push The Lumen Christi pupils made it through to the final after competing in the Northern Ireland heat last November which was supported by the Confucius Institute at Ulster University. Leo, who has only been learning Mandarin for two years, said it was surreal to have won. “I’ve always loved linguistics and with Mandarin, it changes the way you think about languages – it’s almost like a problem to be solved. I also like that you can watch dferent TV, listen to Chinese music and communicate with people across the world. “I was shocked when I won. There were so many good competitors and I didn’t expect to come away with anything. I was just there for the experience, and it wasn’t really about the winning so to speak –it still feels very surreal. googletag.cmd.push “My teacher XU Honge helped me prepare - giving me lots of tips and tricks ahead of the competition as well as showing me how to manipulate the language. It was definitely a lot more work than I originally thought, but well worth it!” He now plans to study Maths at either Cambridge University or St Andrew’s. “At university I plan to study Maths as it’s just something I enjoy and hopefully it will take me into some job I like. I aim to keep learning Mandarin as I think it will be useful – you see jobs in London, Dublin and even Derry where they need people that can speak Mandarin and communicate with people in China.” Dr Marie Ferris, Vice Principal at Lumen Christi Collegesaid: “We’re just so tremendously proud of Leo, as well as the rest of our finalists. It’s a great achievement for all of them – they were very professional and performed at such a high level, especially considering the competition they had to face. “I must pay tribute to their Mandarin teachers from the Confucius Institute, who have worked so hard with them. As a school, we have been part of the Confucius project since  and it’s created so many opportunities for our pupils, helping them learn more about Chinese language and culture.” As the most spoken language in the world, Mandarin is recognised as a valuable skill for young people in the UK to acquire.  per cent of British business leaders surveyed in  said that speaking Mandarin will give school leavers a career advantage. Research by the British Council has found that Mandarin is the second most important foreign language for the UK’s influence on the global stage.Jonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland commended Leos achievement. He said: “Congratulations to Leo on such a fantastic achievement, which is testament to the hard work he and his teachers have put in throughout the past year. We hope that Leo is an inspiration to other students to think about learning Mandarin or finding out more about Chinese language and culture. “Language learning is an essential part of understanding and collaborating with other countries and cultures. With more than one billion Mandarin speakers in the world, it’s important that more young people in the UK learn the language – those that do will find it opens up exciting study and work opportunities in our increasingly interconnected world. “In the British Council we have a wide range of opportunities and resources available to support schools who are keen to get more involved in international work and would encourage other schools to get in touch with us to see how we can support their international ambitions.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district.Roads officials have previously insisted that the planned scheme will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety. In addition, officials are confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates that the bypass would provide a good economic .Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.ldquoI believe the time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding, he declared. ldquoI have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.ldquoThe government department has now moved to a position with all its ducks in this particular scheme now in a row. The public enquiry has been completed and the only thing delaying the scheme is funding.Cllr Walker said he believed that with the Assembly restored and a local minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure, the council needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon to seek the immediate release of bypass funding to not only alleviate town centre congestion in Ballynahinch, but provide a major boost for the wider South Down area, in particular, tourism.Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, described the market town as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.ldquoThis not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town. The proposed bypass will run round the eastern periphery of the town with a grade-separated junction at the Crossgar Road, she continued.ldquoHousing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site. The bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road.Cllr Mason said the new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme as soon as possible.She said that in , the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard announced his decision to proceed with the bypass proposal and instructed officials to continue to prioritise this scheme until completion unless instructed otherwise by a new minister. Cllr Mason continued: ldquoWith the infrastructure minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.She said the tender process for construction should begin as soon as possible, suggesting there is no reason why construction cannot commence this time next year, with the scheme complete and open to vehicles by .Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that the new infrastructure minister will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch but the wider South Down area, he said.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoIn addition, the A is the main link between Downpatrick and Belfast and while there have been ious upgrades, the section between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden is simply not suitable for the huge volume of traffic which uses this busy road. Itrsquos upgrade is also a priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Caroline.jpg","title":"Caroline’s love of Newcastle beach inspires St Patrick Centre exhibition  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE artistrsquos fascination with the townrsquos famous beach has inspired her latest exhibition.Caroline Williamson is showing over  pieces of her work throughout February at the St Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick.Just opened this week, Caroline said that the exhibition is called lsquoShell Sounds from the Shorersquo.She said: ldquoOne of my fondest memories is walking down the Newcastle beach, collecting shells with my grandmother.

The ballot was ided into three sections, UK, Devolved and Local.In South Down, .% of over , young respondents said that protecting the environment was the most important UK issue, with almost % in favour of lowering the voting age to .Other key issues were tackling hate crime , welcoming refugeesand making UN Convention Rights of the Child law .Under devolved issues, .% of young people said mental health was the most important issue when compared to child poverty , ending kne crime , curriculum for leand stopping street harassment .Over , young people responded to this part of the ballot and % of responses were environmental issues mdash ranging from dealing with erosion at Ballyhornan to improving school eco-councils to introducing more recycling points.Overall, the top five biggest inidual local issues were stopping the amalgamation of St Patrickrsquos Grammar with St Maryrsquos and De La Salle High Schools in Downpatrick . Other local issues highlighted included tackling litter , mental health , drug misuseand protecting the local environment .

He is an example to all of us of what a campaigner should be doing. ldquoIn many ways Cormac, you are the Greta Thunberg of South Down. You must be able to use that capacity to challenge your peers, government departments and even your teachers to improve the world we all live and recreate in.ldquoYou also need to challenge our communities to awaken and re-engage with ordinary politics in a way in which people have resonated with the problems presented by Brexit.Focusong on the local issues, Baroness Ritchie described these as ldquodominant topics that occupy young people, highlighting the need for investment of resources and the deployment of new and dferent policy directives to accommodate the challenges of the geographical area, given the myriad of problems facing our young people.Regarding the issues raised under the devolved government category, Baroness Ritchie said she wanted a copy of the findings sent to Ministers in the NI Executive and to the chairs of the relevant Assembly Committees ldquoto identy policy and spending priorities for them in the Programme for Government and Budget.Last weekrsquos event was also attended by local councillors Dermot Curran, Patrick Brown, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold McKee.Baroness Ritchie and Cllr Andrews presented the school awards to the teachers who co-ordinated the vote in their respective schools and they included Mrs Mairead Arkins ,Mrs Jackie Bogues , Miss Aine McMullanand Year  pupil Cloacutedagh Bogues who single-handedly co-ordinated the vote in her school, collected Ballynahinch Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos award.Down High and De La Salle High schools also took part in the consultation, but representatives were unable to attend last weekrsquos event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Destructive.jpg","title":"Destructive Natasha is too hot for Fermanagh  ","story":"DOWN Ladies made it two wins from two with a hard-fought victory over Ulster neighbours Fermanagh in Teconnaught on Sunday afternoon.Down began well, but struggled to turn lots of possession into scores, with Fermanagh getting plenty of bodies behind the ball, making it dficult for the home side to find space.Downrsquos superb work rate, defensive structure and high rate of turnovers, provided the  for a half time lead of - to -.With four of Fermanaghrsquos scores from frees, plus a missed penalty and disallowed goal by Down, clearly showed the superiority of the Mourne girls in the first half.It was Fermanagh, though, who began the second half the stronger side, keeping the majority of possession and getting back to within a point on the scoreboard.However, Down found another gear in the final quarter to power home as convincing winners on a scoreline of - to -.Many thanks to Teconnaught GAC for their superb hospitality and facilities.Also a very special mention is due to Teconnaughtrsquos Aimee Greene, who made herto county colours after a  month lay-off with a cruciate knee ligament injury.Next up is a trip to Sligo on Sunday.Down scorers: Natasha Ferris , Aoe Laverty , Anna McKee , Mary Adegbamiye , Lauren Cunningham ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 5%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Plans for a major four-lane carriageway through the heart of Downpatrickrsquos town centre were unveiled this week by anxious Department of Environment officials.The scheme is the result of ten years of research into the townrsquos planning and environmental future mdash a future which has now become totally dependent on a traffic plan solution.The details of the new road proposals were given at a special two-hour press briefing on Friday afternoon and Department of Environmental officials admit they are anxiously awaiting public response.The speculation that the town was to get a lsquoring roadrsquo has been quashed by the proposal mdash in fact, say officials, it was never really on the cards mdash and the new system is simply a means of distributing the traffic inside the town rather than re-routing outside the town limits.Eleven separate routes for a new road were studied and the choice narrowed down to four. The pick of those four has now been decided after years of exploratory talks and detailed investigations. Ironically, the final choice is of a route which dfers only slightly from one suggested by the  Downpatrick Area Plan.The new road will begin, effectively, from the entrance to the Meadowlands housing estate in Church Street and will run behind existing Church Street premises on a widening parallel, into the town centre.It will emerge onto the lower part of Scotch Street, across the rear of the Town Hall building and into Irish Street. Use of the present entrance to the new Irish Street car park will probably be made to swing the road through the rear of Market Street into St Patrickrsquos Avenue and on into the Ballydugan Road.KILLYLEAGH mdash A row is brewing in Killyleagh over proposals to open a pool hall in the townrsquos High Street.Angry residents in the area have drawn up a petition objecting to it being opened because they say that area has already suffered severely at the hands of vandals.Local councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, explained that  objectors had signed the petition because they were concerned that the pool hall would bring with it a sinister element.He said people in the immediate vicinity of the empty premises to be turned into a pool room were afraid to go to bed at the weekends and they fear this could escalate.Mr Osborne stressed he did not object to the idea of the pool room, he hoped it would take young people off the street, but he felt it was being sited in the wrong area of town.BALLYHORNAN mdash Plannersrsquo refusal to allow a new caravan site at Ballyhornan will have a major effect on Down Councilrsquos development programmes for the area, it was claimed this week.The claim was made by Downpatrick councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, who said planners were wrong to issue such a decision until a general development policy had been worked out.Mr McGrady also said he could not understand why there should not be potential for a new holiday location on the Lecale coast, where a number of such locations already existed.He stressed that in the absence of an Area Plan the council should have a policy on this.A planning spokesman confirmed there would be a policy on locations for caravan development when the area plan was published.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Mrs Margaret Atkins, we of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Humphrey Atkins, made a surprise visit to the Plessey Telecommunications factory in Ballynahinch on Tuesday morning.While her husband was at Stormont trying to thrash out the provincersquos problems in the round table talks, Mrs Atkins was having an extensive two-hour tour of the factory, under the guidance of senior Plessey officials.Mrs Atkins arrived shortly after .am and after a y talk with senior management, including Mr Harold Davies, regional director, and Mr Gerry OrsquoNeill, manager at Ballynahinch, she was shown around the factory.She met and spoke to many of the factoryrsquos -plus employees, sharing jokes and listening and enquiring about what kind of work was done.CROSSGAR mdash Sgt Matthew Cuffey, of st Crossgar Boysrsquo Brigade, has won the Northern Ireland Squad Commanderrsquos Shield at the annual squad drill finals in Omagh on Saturday.Matthew and the st Crossgar Company were representing Down Battalion at the finals, and although the squad finished third mdash three points behind hat-trick winners st Castlederg mdash there was some consolation in the squad commanderrsquos success.This very high honour for Down Battalion and indeed, has been won four times previously by Crossgar boys since the competitionrsquos inception in .Down Battalion officers were delighted at the results, and congratulations are extended to the companyrsquos captain, Mr R Dickson, and drill officers, Mr D Nesbitt, and to the boys themselves.DUNDRUM mdash The controversy over whether a section of lane way in Dundrum would remain open is almost over mdash and itrsquos now virtually certain that it will not be closed.Members of the Dundrum and District Community Committee were told of this at their monthly meeting in the Bay Inn on Tuesday night by the secretary, who read letters received from the estate agents and solicitors of the Lord Downshire Estate, who previously owned the lane.The controversy, highlighted by the Recorder last week, had flared up when local residents sensed Mr Albert Donnelly, the owner of the caravan sites on either side of the lane, which runs from Castle Hill to the junction with the Dromara Road, was preparing to close the lane.Pillars had been erected on the lane and residents were adamant gates would not be put up to block their right of way. The lane had been sold by Lord Downshirersquos estate to Mr Donnelly, but there had been some doubt whether a right of way clause had been ed.This has now been cleared up by the letters from Lord Downshirersquos estate agents and solicitors, who pointed out that the lane way had been sold but that the right of way was reserved. The letters added that they hoped this would allay the fears of villagers.The committee, however, have decided to seek legal assistance on the matter to clear it up permanently.ARDGLASS mdash Hopes are high this week that the EEC will grant aid a fish processing unit in Ardglass.Euro MP, Mr John Hume, has taken up the case in Brussels and yesterday he reported that the ECC Commission was ldquocarefully considering grant aiding the locally financed scheme.One of the biggest problems with the fishing industry at Ardglass has been the lack of fish processing facilities, despite the economic benefits from it.Mr Hume told the Recorder yesterday he was ldquofairly confident the EEC would give aid to a fish offal plant at the harbour.He has been in constant touch with local fishermen in the area and yesterday announced another major breakthrough in his battle to secure a better deal for them.In reply to a parliamentary question he tabled in Brussels, Mr Hume has been told a study of fishing industry in Northern Ireland to be undertaken.ldquoI regard this as a welcome first step and hope the study will concentrate on developing the potential of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland with a view to greater investment in its development, he said.Mr Hume is at present awaiting a reply from the European Commission on ldquothe scientic justication for its ban on barring fishermen off the Co Down coast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Late.jpg","title":"Late points give Down huge boost  ","story":"FINGERNAILS were being bitten to the quick by worried Down fans in the main stand at Pairc Esler on Saturday night as this encounter hurtled to conclusion.The sides had been locked in a fierce battle for supremacy and with time almost up, nothing separated them at - apiece.However, Down had a sting in the tail and just when it looked asthey were heading for another draw, Barry OrsquoHagan, Jerome Johnston and Donal OrsquoHare plundered points to maintain their unbeaten start to the campaign.All Derry could manage in reply was a single point from Chris Bradley, leaving manager Rory Gallagher lots to ponder on after his side squandered a host of great scoring opportunities.Now for Division  favourites Cork away this weekend with a place in the new top tier of All-Ireland Championship very much at stake.Derry, who also fancy a place at the top table and who drew their opener with Leitrim, last weekend, opened well with Shane McGuigan taking a marvellous score in the first minute.Down responded well and Kilcoorsquos Jerome Johnston, who wasnrsquot expected to start, quickly brought the sides level.However, Derry re-established their lead with two well-taken scores from Benny Heron and Shea Downey.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.Other district hot-spots include Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order, with faults reported in Killyleagh and  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.Elsewhere,  street lights are currently out of order in Ballygowan, with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Downpatrick area councillor, Dermot Curran, who hopes to meet with Ms Mallon to discuss the issue, said investment must be found to address the street lighting debacle.He said that repairs are generally limited to those that can be carried out by the government departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Cllr Curran described the number of street lights not working across East Down and Lecale as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.ldquoFaulty street lights represent a health and safety issue for drivers and pedestrians and there is not one area in the district which is not affected, he continued.ldquoWhile the new infrastructure minister will be inundated with requests for meetings and investment in key projects, repairing faulty street lights has to be a priority. The fact that in the local area there are  broken lights beggars belief. I have no doubt that the number will increase before the government department can begin to get to grips with this issue.Cllr Curran said street lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem.He said a fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.ldquoI recognise that the new minister will have an overflowing intray and will have to work with her officials to determine the priorities in the months ahead. It is my contention that repairing faulty street lights must be one of those priorities, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe new ministerrsquos department faces budgetary challenges, but the resources required to deliver a full street lighting repair service must be made available..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Men.jpg","title":"Men form football team to help with grief of losing baby  ","story":"THE love of football is helping men deal with the grief of losing a baby before, during or after birth.Downpatrick man Pat Moore has teamed up with personal trainer John Fegan from Rostrevor to formthe first Sands United County Down team.The team plays its first match against County Down Masters at the end of the month.Sands is a Northern Ireland charity which provides support to bereaved parents who have lost a baby either through miscarriage, stillbirth or within days or weeks of birth.Both men were helped by Sands when they lost babies before birth and admit they have struggled to deal with their own loss while supporting their partners.By coming together to play the sport they love, Pat, whorsquos better known locally as chairman of Celtic Bhoys FC, hopes that it will help him and other men find support and understanding with other menwho are going dealing with the same thing.The  year-old father of two said that he and his partner lost a much wanted baby during pregnancy nearly two years ago.ldquoOnce we knew we were going to have our first baby together, we were so happy about it and immediately began to plan for its arrival, said Pat.ldquoI expect a lot of men are the same but at the time it happened I had to step up and do all the organising while supporting my partner who was just devastated. When your partner is lying in hospital like that, all you want to do is to take the pain away but, at the same time, you have to put on a brave face for everyone involved.While the team is about football, Pat hopes that the members will be able to socialise after matches and share their experiences.Pat and seven of his friends are also fundraising for Sands by running in the Carlingford half marathon in March and the Belfast Marathon in May.He connected with John Fegan, whose family used to live in Downpatrick, on Facebook after John announced his intention to create the football team.John and his fiancee Kathryn Cole lost their first baby, Faith, at around  weeks into the pregnancy three years ago, although they are now parents to two children, Jude and Matilda.Like Pat, the  year-old knows the importance of physical activity and sport to help with mensrsquo mental health and being able to cope with the loss of baby in this way.He said: ldquoI was encouraged to do this when I realised there were other Sands football teams in Northern Ireland but none for County Down.ldquoThis is for fathers, uncles, brothers, grandfathers, cousins, whatever men who have been affected by the loss of a child. We share that we are united by angels, which is our motto.John said that there are now over  men who have joined the club and he and Pat hope to welcome more throughout the year.The first match will be held at Assumption Grammar School, Ballynahinch on Friday, February  at pm.

But credit due to both Paddy and Alec for their performances against regular league players.Group four, headed up by Colin McKinty, always a dangerous competitor in competitions, but he had to contend with an equally talented player in Sean Poland, who has been in great form recently.John Campbell, another player who is in sight of a regular place in the Strangford C team and the affable Katy Rice, improving with every game she plays, completed the group.The first spot in this group was always going to be tight, but McKintyrsquos steady defence was the key factor in finishing top of this group with Poland second.Group four with Michael Carey having steered Strangford B to their third consecutive isional title, was the clear favourite to finish in first place, but would have to contend with the Drumaness No  Pat Mulholland, who has been in excellent form throughout the league campaign.Also in this five-man group were Michael Deery, team-mate Niall Houghan and Drumaness man Seamus McGivern, more at home on the snooker table, but still no stranger to the plastic ball.The games in this group were hotly contested, but in the final game of the group Mulholland and Carey would battle it out for the top place.The first game could have gone either way with Pat just edging home -.The next was equally close but, in the end, it was the Drumaness man who finished in top place with just five points the dference.The first quarter-final match was an all-Strangford clash between McKinty and McCusker.The first two games were shared, but the steady place of McCusker, mixed with well-judged attack, saw him take the next two games to progress to the semi-finals.The second match featured the Drumanessrsquo Pat Mulholland and Charlie Murray. This was easily the match of the round.Mulholland won the first two games, the next two went to Murray with a nip and tuck decider before Mulholland just edged it -. The third match of the round involved second seed Donald Campbell taking on his skipper Michael Carey.The games were all close, but the blistering attack of Campbell saw him progress in straight games. Vincey Poland had perhaps the easiest match of the round against new comer John Campbell.As expected, Poland had too much iation for his opponent and ran out a comfortable - winner.McCusker stated this competition a dark horse to a least reach the final.His opponent in the semi-finals was Donald Campbell and he started as favourite.This semi-final turned out to be the closest match of the competition. John won the first two games and looked confident to reach the final.Back came Campbell to even the score, but McCusker won the first four points of the game and held on win -, leaving Donald to reflect on a match he should have won when he held a game point in the first encounter of the match.The next match was a close affair, but Poland was always in control with Pat Mulholland delighted to have reached this stage of the competition.It was a gallant effort from the Drumaness man but, in the end, Poland booked his final place with a straight game victoryThe home crowd was pleased to see a local man in the final of the competition, but knew he needed to produce something special to beat a player of Polandrsquos stature.The games were close and John, encouraged by his supporters, did everything he could to stem the flow of winners from one of the leaguersquos best backhand exponent, but to no avail and lost in straight games.League secretary, Jim Ritchie, thanked the Strangford club for staging this event and providing refreshment throughout the evening and the competitors for their generous contribution to the charity fund.Competition referee, Peter Deeny, also acknowledged the friendly, competitive spirit in which this event was enjoyed by all participants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11004234.jpg","title":"bandstand paddy mulligan","story":"What genre genres do you consider your music to be How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band What does  hold for you Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The first indication of the party’s swelling support was in a January poll showing a seven-point increase in support since October.Five days later a Sunday Business Post poll showed an eight-point surge in support over a two-month period.Two days later, an Irish Daily Mail poll put Sinn Fein support up five percentage points from a month earlier.There is an uncanny correlation between the time at which those pollsshowed a surge in support and the restoration of Stormont on January  – although that may be entirely coincidental.Having initially risen in the polls after walking out of Stormont but then having been down in the polls and in elections – with the exception of by-elections – for much of the time when Stormont was down, it is remarkable that Sinn Fein’s surge has coincided so precisely with devolution’s .There is limited reason to believe that voters desperate to be able to afford a house or see a doctor were influenced by what to many of them must seem like esoteric questions about the north which have far less bearing on their lives.Other issues such as the RIC commemoration controversy flared just before Stormont’s , contributing to some voters’ weariness at the old parties.It may be that the impact of theof devolution was limited to blunting other parties’ attacks and giving Sinn Fein some free publicity.But the scale and suddenness of the party’s surge is such that it prompts a search for answers in what would otherwise be unlikely places.Brexit could leave NI in dferent time zone from GB, peers warn Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingMan killed partner before killing and raping her teenage daughter in Newry apartment, inquest hearsStorm Ciara: NI braced for most violent storm since  -danger to le alerts - frequent lightning strikes, heavy rain, snow and possibility of mobile phone signal and power outagesStorm Ciara to batter NI with mph gales - weather warning upgraded to amber - possible impact on travel and electricity supplyWar of words as Stephen Nolan and Cool FM Breakfast both claim to be lsquobiggest show in the countryrsquoNI Snow Map: Heavy snowfall, sleet and ice forecast for most parts of NI - temperature to feel as cold as -degC        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Politics\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and travel","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent.

This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The pupils were then asked to redesign the maps by using their knowledge of the local area. They identied key landmarks, short cuts and potential barriers to walking and cycling.The pupils also developed a set of symbols and a map key which will be used in the new map.Sustrans also held a parent engagement workshop where they invited families to identy routes that they and their children use.Sustrans will produce a bilingual pocket-sized travel map which will be available to students, staff and parents for free. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
