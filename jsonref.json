[{"url":null,"title":"The Queen told Meghan Markle carry acting joining royal family","story":"Share this article\u0027The word I was given was that those conversations were not productive. But they are glad that they have at least started a conversation.\u0027And I think what is still upsetting to them is the palace keep saying they want to work it out privately, but yet, they believe these false stories are coming out that are very disparaging against Meghan, still. \u0027No one in the Royal Family has talked to Meghan yet, at this particular time. \u0027And I think it\u0027s frustrating for them to see that it\u0027s a racial conversation about the Royal Family when all they wanted all along was for the royals to intervene and tell the press to stop with the unfair, inaccurate, false stories that definitely have a racial slant.\u0027And until you can acknowledge that, I think it\u0027s going to be hard to move forward. \u0027But they both want to move forward with this and they both want healing in this family. At the end of the day, that is Harry\u0027s family.\u0027 During the interview, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said racism drove them out of Britain and claimed their son Archie was denied the title of prince because he is mixed-race.The Duke of Cambridge was the first royal to personally respond to the racism allegations days after the interview aired when he spoke about mental health during a visit the School21 in east London. At the time, he revealed that he had not spoken to his brother since it came out, but added that he \u0027will do\u0027. It was also the first engagement for Kate since Meghan said she made her cry in the bombshell tell-all chat.  Meghan said: \u0027She (Kate) was upset about something, but she owned it, and she apologised. And she brought me flowers\u0027. During the Oprah interview, Meghan also revealed details about their strained relationship, saying of pictures of them laughing at Wimbledon: \u0027Nothing is what it looks like.\u0027She added that Kate being called \u0027waity Katie\u0027 in the press couldn\u0027t compare to the alleged racism she faced. Meghan also said she felt suicidal and turned to the palace\u0027s HR representatives for help. The Duchess of Sussex told Oprah she \u0027couldn\u0027t be left alone\u0027 and told her husband she \u0027didn\u0027t want to be alive anymore\u0027 before claiming the Buckingham Palace HR department ignored her plea for help because she wasn\u0027t a \u0027paid employee\u0027.   Describing how she considered ending her life, believing it \u0027was better for everyone\u0027, Meghan said: \u0027I knew that if I didn\u0027t say it, that I would do it. I just didn\u0027t want to be alive anymore. \u0027And that was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought. I remember how he just cradled me. I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help. \u0027I said that I\u0027ve never felt this way before, and I need to go somewhere. And I was told that I couldn\u0027t, that it wouldn\u0027t be good for the institution\u0027.She said that after confiding in her husband, she was forced to go to the Royal Albert Hall for a charity event in January 2019, claiming photos from that night \u0027haunt me\u0027. She told Oprah she later reached out to one of Diana\u0027s best friends because she felt unsupported by the palace.She said: \u0027When I joined that family, that was the last time I saw my passport, my driving licence, my keys - all of that gets turned over\u0027. Meghan said Harry had \u0027saved my life\u0027 by agreeing to move to Los Angeles. During the broadcast, Harry also claimed his brother was \u0027trapped\u0027 in the Royal Family. Harry said he felt \u0027very let down\u0027 by his father Prince Charles, accusing him of refusing to take his calls.He added that his mother Diana would be \u0027angry and sad\u0027 that he felt he had to leave the royal family, but \u0027she saw it coming\u0027. The Queen broke her silence on the interview, voicing her \u0027concern\u0027 over the issues raised, \u0027particularly that of race\u0027, although the statement added that \u0027some recollections may vary\u0027.  There has been much speculation about which member of the royal family they were accusing of racism. But during the interview the couple would not be drawn on who had deeply offended them.Harry said: \u0027That conversation, I am never going to share.

Thankfully, eggs welcome that kind of thinking, especially scrambled. “When you’ve got 15-20 seconds left of stirring, throw in shredded wild garlic and it will give itself in to the warmth of the eggs,” says Diacono, whose new book Herb: A Cook’s Companion is out this month. “That way, you’ll keep the green freshness and garlickiness, too, which is lovely.” Alternatively, toss shredded leaves into herby chopped eggs. While chives and tarragon may seem the obvious go-tos for eggs, Diacono suggests parsley: “It works really well with wild garlic, especially if thrown into a mustardy mayonnaise to go with eggs on toast.” Wild garlic makes a great finishing touch for the likes of risotto (shredded, then stirred in off the heat, Diacono says) and broths. “Use it like spinach,” says Robin Gill, chef-owner of Darby’s, Bermondsey Larder and Sorella in London. “For a simple, Japanese-style broth at home – brown miso, boiling water, vegetables, maybe a bit of poached fish – I’ll drop in wild garlic at the end. It just elevates things.” Succulent young leaves are good company for leafy salads, but make sure they’re cut small. “About 7-8cm at the most, so you get this ‘ping’ here and there,” Diacono says. “It’s wonderful with some shredded mint, too.” And keep the dressing simple: lemon juice, good olive oil, a touch of mustard, maybe some honey. “You don’t want to drive a bus over wild garlic.” Gill turns a bounty of garlic into a better bit of butter. He folds equal amounts of chopped parsley and wild garlic into softened butter, seasons, then uses greaseproof paper to roll it into a cylinder. “If you’re cooking mushrooms, add a knob of the butter at the end, or drop in the pan when frying fish,” he says. It also works well with lamb: “Cook a rack or chop, rest, then turn on the grill and put a cylinder of butter on the eye of the meat, flash it under the grill, and the flavoured butter will ooze into the lamb.” You’ve also got the flowers and stalks to play with. The latter, Gill says, can be chopped and pickled: put 500ml water, 400ml vinegar and 100g sugar in a pan, bring to a boil, then pour over the stems in sterilised jars. “Drain the pickled stems, fold through yoghurt and have it as an accompaniment to something spicy, like curries.” Flowers, meanwhile, could live between sheets of filo to make a lid for, say, chicken pie. Brush a sheet with butter, scatter with flowers, top with another sheet, brush with more butter, then bake. Finally, after the flowers come seeds, which Gill packs in salt for a few hours, before rinsing and pickling. “You’ve then got wild garlic capers,” he says. “They’re really nice in salads and sauces, and will be good for a year.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9c67f7993e9415089ebcdd4a290a86758dbf48e/130_114_6873_4124/master/6873.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=803ee376d11d03f003734a5200016916","title":"a wine romance how to taste wine and what to eat with it","story":"Ultimately, it’s all part of getting as much flavour, enjoyment and information out of the wine as possible – which doesn’t seem quite so bizarre. After all, says Graham Nash, wine product developer at Tesco: “The important thing to understand when tasting and drinking wine is that it’s for enjoyment.” And you can elevate that enjoyment with a few expert tips. So, glass at the ready and bottle in hand, let’s get tasting. How to tasteWe tend to serve our reds warm and our whites cold. Actually, cooling some red wines (depending on their starting temperature) a little will make them taste more fragrant and fruity. Similarly, serving white very cold can mute the aromas and flavour. Try the 2020 guide: put your red in the fridge for 20 minutes before serving, and take your white out 20 minutes before. Make sure you have a clean glass with plenty of room to swirl so you don’t accidentally cover your neighbour in wine. Pour yourself a little. Don’t take a sip yet. You can learn a lot from the colour. For reds, a pale colour is normally a sign that the wine will be lighter in body. A deep colour in a white could mean that it’s oaked or has some maturity, and may have more complex flavours. Now, give the wine a swirl, this opens it up and releases the aroma. Have a gentle sniff. Does it smell spicy or is there some vanilla? This might be a sign that the wine has spent time in oak barrels. Is it fruity? If so, what type of fruit? What about other aromas such as flowers, vegetables, honey or nuts? Finally, have a think about how strong the aroma is. At last, you get to take a sip, but don’t swallow straight away! Swirl it around the mouth so that it coats your teeth. Then with the wine still in your mouth, breath in a little. This will make a gurgling sound and you will feel ridiculous but this helps bring out the flavours. In a red wine, the first thing you might notice is the tannins, which feel like something you get in a strong cup of tea. Do they grip the mouth? What about the body, is it voluptuous like an Argentine malbec or is it light like a beaujolais? In a white, notice the level of sweetness. Is it bone dry like a chablis or off-dry like a classic German riesling? In both red and white, there will be acidity: is the wine sharp or soft? Can you feel any alcoholic warmth? Look for spicy or toasty notes, a sign of oak maturation. Now swallow. Yes, that’s allowed – you don’t have to spit unless you have dozens of wines to taste. Finally, it’s time to put everything together. Nash has some pointers for what to think about: “The length of wine – in other words how long the flavours last after you’ve spat it out or swallowed – can be a good indicator of quality. How different components, such as fruit, tannin, alcohol and sweetness come together are they all in balance? Is everything harmonised?” At the end of the day though it’s your personal taste that matters. “There’s a difference between deciding what’s a ‘good’ wine and deciding what you like,” says Nash. A wine could be impressive to some people but not be your cup of tea – or, rather, glass of wine. The pointers here are to help you explore and experience the wine. “The most important thing,” says Nash, “is don’t feel the need to be tied by traditions and what you think you should do. If you want to enjoy red wine with fish, then that’s fine.” The red meat with red wine, white meat and fish with white “rule” is much too simplistic. Instead look at flavours, a highly spiced beef dish is going to require a very different wine to simple roast beef, for example. Matches made in heaven …Rare meat and tannin love each other: the tannin softens the meat and vice versa, so sturdy wines such as red bordeaux taste fruitier and more delicious. Opposites attract: with fatty food, go for wines with high acidity, such as pinot noir with duck, and match salty blue cheeses with sweet wines, such as port with stilton. But when it comes to flavour, look for likenesses: try a buttery chicken with a buttery oaked chardonnay, while lemon juice loves a lemony wine such as an albariño. Local wine with local food: goat’s cheese, very popular in the Loire, goes perfectly with a wine, such as sancerre, from the same area. Tricky customersBeware vinegar: while fish, chips and champagne are a flawless threesome, few wines stand up to lots of malt vinegar so be sparing on your chips. Pay attention to sugar: ideally your wine should always be sweeter than the dish you’re eating. Sweet puddings, then, need very sweet wines. Watch out for chillies: spicy food can numb the palate or make tannic wines taste bitter. Nash recommends a fruity white, ideally with a little sweetness, such as a German riesling. So that’s wine matching 101 – ideal for enhanced appreciation and sounding like a pro in wine Zooms and (one day) wine bars. But, ultimately, it’s your glass. When it comes to wine and food appreciation, as long as you’re enjoying it, you’re doing it right. Cheers.

These days, a good wine label is better than a holiday phrasebook, and achieves many of the same ends, guiding the drinker to the right destination without the bother of learning all the grammar first. These labels now offer enough information for everyone, from amateurs to obsessives. So, what’s in a label – and what matters? It’s all about the where“Look for a place,” says Kevin Meehan, Tesco wine product development manager. “Good wine should offer a sense of where it comes from, and wines that proudly call out their origins on the label will have been made with a sense of pride in that place. It’s often regulated too, so there are minimum standards the wine must meet in order to use the name of a region.” On Italian wines, for example, you might see DOC, or designation of controlled origin – which is a mark of quality and origin. But not about the whenAs for vintages: many of us think we should worry about whether 2019 was a good year for Argentinian malbec, or whether a hot, dry 2018 summer in Burgundy made for great chablis premier cru. But actually, these days that is less of a concern. Not only have winemaking skills improved to such an extent that winemakers are much better at managing weather fluctuations, but the old saying, that the best producers make good wine even in a bad year, holds true. Buy good wine and you won’t need a good year. Tasting notes: the basics“Aromas of black fruits and coffee, followed by notes of spice and chocolate” may not mean much at first, but the more you study, the more that tasting notes can help you with your wine choices. Clear, well-written tasting notes are invaluable in deciding whether an unknown wine is something you’ll actually enjoy drinking – and is the key to expanding your horizons. Meehan advises reading the label again after you’ve tried the wine, so that you remember, for future reference, the flavours that really make your tastebuds light up. So, if your first love was a cabernet sauvignon for example, seeking its tasting notes elsewhere might lead you to a black-fruit-aroma pinotage. And if you like beaujolais, chances are you’ll go on to love valpolicella ripasso – it has the same red and black cherry flavours, but more depth and is great with pasta. Or if yours is a prosecco, try blanquette de limoux, an ancient French fizz that is just as dry, but with a bit more texture and lovely stone fruit and brioche flavours. This works with food flavours, too: if you love pepper sauce with steak, seek out wines with a slightly peppery flavour (the back label should tell you so) such as a syrah or shiraz (two names for the same grape). Or if you’ve got a thing for rum’n’raisin ice-cream, try pouring the Spanish sweet wine pedro ximénez over vanilla: another sweet raisiny dessert, but with a touch less sugar and a bit more alcohol. That way, you can make wine an integral part of dinner. Tasting notes: intermediate levelAt this stage, picking your wine becomes almost as much fun as drinking it. Comparisons are how experts expand their knowledge, and this is a game that everyone can play. You may never have heard of either greco or falanghina – two white varieties from Campania in southern Italy – but the Tesco Finest versions of both are the same price (£9) and made by the renowned producer Feudi di San Gregorio. Yet the flavours are very different: the first green-apple crisp, the second gentler, more floral. Which is better? That depends entirely on your palate, so try both and you will know which way to lean with white wines in future. Or, to better understand a variety, pick versions to compare. Tesco Finest Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé are two admired sauvignon blancs from appellations just 10 miles apart in France’s Loire valley. The range’s New World rieslings are rather farther apart, from either side of the Tasman Sea, but still make an intriguing contrast: both are dry, but the Tingleup, from the exciting Great Southern region of Western Australia, is pure and citrussy, while the New Zealander has more peach and honeysuckle. The more you “practise”, the more confident you’ll be using once-obtuse tasting notes to find what you like. Finally, you probably don’t care about …Sulphite. If you don’t know what a sulphite is, you can strike that off your “to-scrutinise” list. Almost all wines contain sulphites, and saying so is simply a legal requirement – like alcohol percentage. … but you should pay attention toAwards. Many of the wines have won prestigious awards, and the bottle will tell you that, too – look for gold, silver or bronze medals by established awards bodies such as the International Wine Challenge. Lastly, take note not just of awards or regions but also of the producer. These talented winemakers can be a jumping-off point for further discovery. Follow the clues, and the labels of bottles can be a passport to all the wine regions of the world.

Rainer Hanshe has translated several of Baudelaire’s books into English – including Belgium Stripped Bare, about the French author’s visit to Brussels just before it was struck by a cholera epidemic. He notes: “The flâneur is a figure who, while immersed in the urban throng, is simultaneously separate from it. If more empty than not, our streets are still to some degree populated, and we can engage in the form of communion that Baudelaire referred to as a mysterious intoxication.” This involves trying to get inside the heads of others – an act of ecstatic empathy that “peoples” the solitary walker’s imagination. It’s a radical idea that envisions the mind as a sponge or, perhaps, a social media channel. Baudelaire’s most memorable phrase for the flâneur was “a kaleidoscope gifted with consciousness”. Some of his ideas need updating. The flâneur might be “a prince enjoying his incognito wherever he goes”, but what about the princesses? Prof Janet Wolff of the University of Manchester has written of the “invisible flâneuse”, of “respectable” women’s absence from public arenas in modern cities. In her 2016 book Flâneuse: Women Walk the City (Penguin, £8.99), Lauren Elkin calls for women to take to the streets, following the example of radically reflective female walkers from Virginia Woolf and Jean Rhys to Rebecca Solnit. The German philosopher Walter Benjamin expanded Baudelaire’s ideas about the flâneur, adding to the myth of Paris as the archetypal modern metropolis. Some of TS Eliot’s poetic evocations of London sprang from his readings of Baudelaire. But one can roam and ruminate equally in Cardiff, Dundee, Liverpool or Belfast. As urban consumer culture spreads, in the shape of delivery vans, Deliveroo bikes, “artisan” coffee shops and the like, you can arguably be a flâneur (there’s also a verb, flâner, to stroll) in towns, villages and countryside. But to do so requires discipline. Here are 10 Baudelairean suggestions for exploring the ghost city. In his poem Le Soleil, Baudelaire writes of “Stumbling on words as on cobblestones”. To say we should treat the city as a text sounds pretentious, but not if we think about street names, tree species and the colours of the brickwork, and unearth forgotten plaques and historic sites. The plaque for Tyburn gallows at Marble Arch is close to a heavily trafficked spot, but few stop to study it. Even famous monuments can be looked at from new angles. Baudelaire wrote about marble statues as if they were sentient. What emotions do they stir in you? Who might have been here before you? For some translators, “idler” is the best equivalent of flâneur. Ambling is best enjoyed slowly, daydreaming. “A dandy does nothing,” Baudelaire wrote. The pandemic-struck city, with its permanent Sunday-state, is ideal for leisurely meandering. Use it while it lasts. Noctambulism is a magical pursuit, as we swap sleep and ordinary dreams (or those garish ones we’ve all been having during lockdowns) for the dreamscape of the city. Artificial light, the absence of others, prowling foxes and the mystery of shadows recast familiar places as strange and special. To see the everyday anew is the ultimate goal of flânerie. If there’s one thing that kills the art of flânerie, it’s the smartphone even worse are apps that count steps. Why look down when you can look up and about? If you want a soundtrack to walk to, visit the University of Birmingham’s Baudelaire Song Project and pick a slow-tempo chanson. The grand iron-and-glass arcades of Paris inspired Walter Benjamin, who was fascinated by the well-stocked magasins, the “temples” of capitalism. Window-shopping has not been banned, and you can still read the signage, promises, buildings, fashions. We are witnessing the gradual abandoning of the arcades Benjamin would have been spellbound. Even Liverpool One, opened in 2008, suddenly seems old and semi-redundant. Cafes shut? Pubs shuttered? There are always benches and steps, parks and plazas, as well as doorways to loiter in. There’s no shame in sitting. In his dazzlingly erudite book, The Walker: On Finding and Losing Yourself in the Modern City (Verso), Matthew Beaumont makes a convincing argument that convalescence – the state between health and illness – is the perfect mode for discovery as it makes us raw and sensitive but also disconnected. If you’re recovering from coronavirus, you may actually be convalescing. As Covid-19 recedes, our cities are convalescing, too. Philosopher Guy Debord, who described walking as a dérive (drift), was influenced by the surrealists, who used chance and games to develop new ideas and perspectives. One of Debord’s friends walked through a region of Germany following a map of London. Why not walk around an empty Manchester using a cut-up map reassembled at random? In his 1989 book Panegyric, Debord recounts wandering around Europe’s great cities trying different alcoholic drinks, including pints of mixed (half-mild, half-bitter) in England. How about a hip flask of absinthe in Aberdeen? In 1955, Debord developed the idea of psychogeography, which was later taken up by Iain Sinclair, Will Self and others. The Paris of Baudelaire and Benjamin is long gone. A flâneur today has to reckon with traffic, overtourism, selfies “in Sartre’s favourite cafe” and soulless spaces like La Défense. The emptying of our cities, and their reinvention post-pandemic has every chance of being an improvement on the hyperinflated housing, glass-and-steel phallocentricity, pseudo-public piazzas and rank consumerism of the late-20th-century metropolis. Perhaps we are ambling into a brighter future? Stockton-on-Tees’ projected giant green space, which will replace high street shops and provide residents with a wonderful patch of rus in urbe when it opens in 2025, harks back to the Victorian era of city parks. Baudelaire writes of Paris’s chiffoniers or ragpickers, marginalised proto-recyclers of the city that ignores and shuns them. Benjamin developed this into the idea of poet-as-ragpicker. The ragpicking flâneur can construct his mental collage from the messy, chaotic, ugly, dirty discarded things found around the city. Dustbins and gutters can tell us more than museums. Keyworkers – including refuse collectors – see more of the “real” city than most. UK cities have some of the most extensive and storied post-industrial landscapes in the world, and most are to be found far from honeypots and theme-park “historic centres”. Baudelaire was not the first – or the last – wandering philosopher-writer. He took key ideas from Edgar Allan Poe, and authors as varied as Charles Dickens, Marcel Proust, George Sand (cross-dressing to penetrate male-dominated milieux), James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges, Franz Hessel, Ralph Ellison and Edmund White have contributed to the tradition. The flâneur appears in paintings by many artists, including Degas and Manet (while Edward Hopper painted like one), and can be seen ghosting through the work of film-makers such as Agnès Varda and Patrick Keiller. Much of the best travel writing benefits from a quizzing gaze, intellectual restlessness and a degree of distance – see Caryl Phillips’ The European Tribe. The empty city is waiting to be filled with new words."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27962993e3b42f8df5603357b5d807388206f872/40_0_4041_2425/master/4041.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f2afcf818c0714dec3f0f9e86616c773","title":"california is on the brink of drought again is it ready","story":"“It’s not just that we’re anticipating a dry year, it’s that this is our second extremely dry year, in a row,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Los Angeles and the Nature Conservancy. California – along with much of the US west – is parched, Swain added, and should brace for water cuts and arid conditions that could trigger more destructive wildfires. Just four years since the state’s last drought emergency, experts and advocates say the state isn’t ready to cope with what could be months and possibly years of drought to come. Heading into the summer, battles are heating up between cities, farms and environmentalists over how scarce supplies are rationed. In the San Joaquin Valley – California’s farming heartland – the last drought never really ended for some. There are still communities in rural Tulare county that are getting their water delivered by trucks, homes with massive tanks parked out front. Reserves of groundwater that millions of households rely on for drinking, cooking and bathing, in some cases, never fully recovered. But at the height of the state’s last major drought, which ran from 2012 through 2016, things were even worse. When residential wells ran dry, “high schools opened up early so students could shower before class”, said Erick Orellana, a policy advocate at the non-profit Community Water Center. Households lucky enough to dredge up some water ran hoses over to neighbors whose supplies had run dry, “so they could flush their toilets”, he said. Underserved communities, Latino and Native communities were the worst affected. Looking ahead, “we’re simply not prepared to prevent that from happening again”, Orellana said. Already, the California Department of Water Resources has announced major cuts to the reservoirs and aqueducts that supply farms and cities. The Federal Bureau of Reclamation, which delivers water to farms up and down the state’s Central Valley, said agricultural customers south of California’s delta, which feeds into the San Francisco bay, will not be getting any water this year. And some localities, including Marin county, north of the San Francisco Bay, have asked residents to voluntarily cut back on their water use. There just isn’t enough water to go around, she added, “and that to me signals we’re going to need the whole system to change”. When rivers and reservoirs run dry, farmers turn to pumping more and more water from the ground. During the last drought, they sucked up so much water that many farmworkers and other residents in the San Joaquin Valley were left without any. Since then, California passed its first-ever law regulating the use of groundwater. As part of the new legislation, over the past two years, communities have been developing proposals to conserve reserves. But these plans haven’t been implemented yet, said Ulibarri – and especially on the heels of the coronavirus crisis, which drained state coffers, state politicians may not have the will or resources to fund much-needed changes. And even as officials review proposals for making changes, big farmers have been able to lobby for more water rights. “Meanwhile, there’s no real lobby for households that also need water,” said Camille Pannu, who directs the Water Justice Clinic at the UC Davis School of Law. “And that’s how we end up with really stark racial inequalities when it comes to access to water” Political clashes over where the limited water supplies should be allocated have already flared up across the state. Environmentalists have warned that they may sue the federal government to prevent it from redirecting delta water to farms at the expense of endangered smelt and salmon. Agricultural lobbies have been pushing the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, who is facing a recall campaign, to provide assurances. And groups such as the Community Water Center have been pushing legislators to pass bills to protect underserved, rural communities’ access. But as officials face fraught decisions about how to allocate water, scientists are warning that the drought will also bring fiercer, more destructive fires across the west. Over the past decade, drought in California contributed to the death of about 163m trees – and dead vegetation has helped fuel some of the most destructive fires in the state’s history over the past few years. The current drought, and the previous one, are characterized by not just low precipitation – but also hotter weather, said Swain of UCLA. Not only drier, but also hotter conditions have primed the landscape to kindle more destructive blazes. “Extreme, intense fires are the exclamation points at the end of long-term droughts,” he said. Last year, which saw the state’s worst wildfire season on record, left 31 people dead, and burned up more than 10,000 buildings. In regions devastated by recent megafires, toxic fallout from the flames have also tainted limited drinking water supplies. “This year is likely to bring more big burns,” Swain said. “There isn’t really any sign of relief on the horizon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/882fc44155a33dfd34f5e6150606119564686c84/0_129_3855_2313/master/3855.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b22be5398ed0c1010ffc241b857e3b73","title":"joe biden coronavirus covid vaccine us politics live latest","story":"“The United States Congress joins all Americans in mourning the tragic death of one of our Capitol Police heroes, Officer Billy Evans,” House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.  “In giving his life to protect our Capitol and our Country, Officer Evans became a martyr for our democracy. On behalf of the entire Congress, we are profoundly grateful. “It is now the great and solemn privilege of the House of Representatives and the Senate to convey the appreciation and the sadness of the Congress and Country for the heroic sacrifice of Officer Evans with a lying-in-honor ceremony in the U.S. Capitol.” The ceremonial event will not be open to the public, because of the coronavirus pandemic, but USCP officers and members of Congress have been invited to a viewing period at the Capitol. As Georgia Republicans face backlash over new sweeping voting restrictions, activists in other states are escalating efforts to oppose similar restrictions advancing in other states. Texas and Arizona have emerged as two of the next major battlegrounds over voting rights. Texas Republicans last week advanced legislation that would limit early voting hours, prohibit drive-thru voting and give partisan poll workers the ability to record voters at the polls, among other measures. In Arizona, Republicans are moving ahead with an audit of ballots from the presidential race while also advancing legislation that would make it harder to vote by mail. Nationally lawmakers have introduced 361 bills to limit access to the ballot in some way, according to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice. Fifty-five of those bills are advancing in legislatures. After companies like Delta and Coca-Cola faced criticism for waiting too long to speak out against the Georgia legislation, advocates have been heartened by swift corporate condemnation of the Texas measure. American Airlines, which is based in Texas, said Thursday it was “strongly opposed” to the Texas legislation. Microsoft and Dell also spoke out against the measures.  Major League Baseball announced Friday it was moving the All-Star Game out of Atlanta in response to Georgia’s sweeping new law. Joe Biden is set to announce today that all American adults will be eligible to receive a coronavirus vaccine by April 19, pushing up his earlier deadline of May 1 by about two weeks, according to reports. The president is set to make the announcement after visiting a vaccination site at Virginia Theological Seminary this afternoon. The news comes as many states have already started making vaccines eligible to all adult residents. Starting today, all adults living in New York are eligible to receive a vaccine. The White House coronavirus response team announced yesterday that 4 million shots were distributed in a single day over the weekend. According to AP, Biden will also announce the US has administered 150 million shots since he took office, bringing him closer to his goal of 200 million doses administered over his first 100 days as president. The blog will have more updates on Biden’s announcement as the day unfolds, so stay tuned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08c39c12510d8a32b5a620e373908ae530a30baa/601_377_3482_2090/master/3482.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=98e86717a10595db4a594a39af05a368","title":"coronavirus live news indian states call for people under 45 to be eligible for vaccine cases rising in japan","story":"To date, 8,743,694 people in Spain have received a single dose of the vaccine, while 2,852,806 have received both doses.  The country’s population is about 47 million. Speaking on Tuesday afternoon, Sánchez said the pace of vaccination would be accelerated over the coming weeks.  The prime minister said Spain had ordered more than 87m doses of the vaccine for delivery between April and September, adding: “That allows us to ensure that any Spaniard who wants to be vaccinated within that period can be.” Sánchez also said his government did not intend to seek an extension of the nationwide state of emergency in place since last October – which includes the current overnight curfew – when it expires on 9 May.  The prime minister was speaking after it emerged that the regional government of Madrid had held three meetings with the manufacturers of the Russian Sputnik vaccine.  The regional president, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, said the meetings had been held “to offer citizens answers”, and attacked the central government for what she termed its tardiness in getting people vaccinated. ”It wouldn’t be the first, or the fifth, or the tenth, time that the Madrid regional government has responded more quickly than the national government and looked into all possible scenarios when it comes to fighting the virus,” she said. Sánchez responded by calling on regional governments to behave in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility, adding: “The success of the EU has been that we’ve been doing it together and negotiating in the name of more than 400 million people … We want to guarantee maximum safety and that’s why we’re using vaccines that have been approved by the EU.” Spain has logged 3,311,523 cases of the coronavirus, and registered 75,783 deaths, according to the health ministry. The country is currently facing a fourth wave of the virus.“The pace of vaccination will accelerate in April and then each month we will improve the vaccination pace from the previous month,” Sanchez told a press conference. Spain will update its 2021 economic outlook to reflect the impact of a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic that weighed on growth in January and February, Sanchez said.  India’s daily infections passed the 100,000 mark for the first time on Monday, data from the health ministry showed. It recorded 96,982 new cases on Tuesday, Reuters reports. She told a Scottish government coronavirus briefing there were 19 fewer people hospitalised with Covid than before the Easter break.  Of these patients, the number in intensive care remains the same as prior to the Easter break at 21, PA reports.  Sturgeon said 2,577,816 people have received the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccination and 463,780 have received their second dose. Poland recorded 8,245 fresh cases and 60 further deaths over the past 24 hours to Tuesday morning, compared with 9,902 cases reported on Monday, data released by the health ministry shows. The number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients rose to 33,544 from 32,656 recorded the previous day, including 3,315 patients on ventilators, against the total of 4,245 ventilators available, the health ministry said on Twitter. In total, 6,665,384 Poles have received jabs against coronavirus, with 2,074,033 of those having had both doses of the vaccine, according to data posted on the official government website, gov.pl. The agreement will nearly double the vaccine output at Catalent’s Bloomington, Indiana, plant this month to about 400 vials a minute, the WSJ reported.Weiss said destinations that should be on the “green” list for international travel from 17 May include the US, Israel and the Caribbean.  He said the US was “vaccinating over 3 million people per day”, Israel was “the world’s leading vaccinated country”, and the Caribbean “has done an awesome job throughout this pandemic of keeping things under control”.  He added: “I think these three areas should be on that list.”  Speaking at the joint press conference, the Heathrow chief executive,  John Holland-Kaye, said the United Arab Emirates could be included as “they also have very high levels of vaccination”, PA reports. “In my opinion, we can say it now, it is clear there is a link with the vaccine. But we still do not know what causes this reaction,” the EMA head of vaccines, Marco Cavaleri, told Italy’s Il Messaggero newspaper. The official reportedly told the paper that Europe’s drug regulator would be making a statement on the issue “in the coming hours”. The EMA said last week it expected to issue an “updated recommendation” on the shot during a meeting of its safety committee that starts today and continues until Friday. Germany, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands have all recently limited inoculation with the Anglo-Swedish company’s vaccine to older age groups pending an EMA investigation, while reports from the UK on Monday suggested Britain’s MHRA was considering a similar restriction and could make an announcement as early as Tuesday. The MHRA’s chief executive, Dr June Raine, said no decision had been made and urged people to continue to get vaccinated.”No decision has yet been made on any regulatory action,” she said.Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London told the BBC that the clots raised questions over whether young people should get the jab. He said: “There is increasing evidence that there is a rare risk associated particularly with the AstraZeneca vaccine, but it may be associated at a lower level with other vaccines, of these unusual blood clots with low platelet counts.“It appears that risk is age related, it may possibly be – but the data is weaker on this – related to sex.” In the UK, the Labour party has warned that Covid status certificates, whereby people would have to prove they have been vaccinated to enter shops, pubs and other indoor settings and mass events, could be “discriminatory”, with the party leader, Keir Starmer, poised to vote against the measures, my colleague Aubrey Allegretti reports. The WHO now expects to review China’s Covid-19 vaccines Sinopharm and Sinovac for possible emergency use listing around the end of April, as more data is required, WHO spokewoman Margaret Harris added at a UN news briefing.The recently deceased former president John Magufuli had dismissed the threat from the coronavirus pandemic, saying God and steam remedies would protect Tanzanians.

Overall, the Black Sea nation of 4 million people has registered more than 275,000 coronavirus cases and 3,832 deaths, the health ministry said. In May last year, Georgia lifted its coronavirus lockdown and allowed shops to reopen, but a night-time curfew has remained in place. In mid-March, Georgia began a national vaccination campaign by inoculating medical workers with AstraZeneca’s jab. Authorities have so far ruled out any further anti-virus curbs."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4522877.1617018310!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"glass ceiling has finally broken in higher education leadership","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFor the first time in its 429-year history, Trinity College Dublin,  Ireland’s oldest university, will elect a female leader. Photograph: iStockThis weekend will mark a momentous occasion in the history of Trinity College Dublin. For the first time in its 429-year history, Ireland’s oldest university will elect a female leader. The appointment of a new, female provost reflects a welcome trend in higher education leadership, with four of the last seven presidential appointments in Irish colleges being women.The appointment of Prof Kerstin Mey as president of the University of Limerick last summer was welcomed but also served to highlight the complete absence of female university presidents up to that point. In some ways the glass ceiling had finally been broken, but it remained to be seen if this was a watershed moment. After waiting so long, 2021 may come to be seen as the year when everything changed, with the appointments of Prof Maggie Cusack as the president of the country’s second technological university and Prof Eeva Leinonen as the next president of Maynooth University preceding the Trinity provostial election.International evidence shows that women often do not put themselves forward for senior roles due to a lack of confidence in the environment to judge them fairly, rather than due to a lack of self-confidence. Being able to see senior female academics leading their university has the potential to change this narrative significantly. Yet appointing senior female leaders will not change culture on its own. These women need to be supported to bring about systemic change, and the Higher Education Authority (HEA) is committed to supporting them in this regard.Lack of ersity in senior decision-making positions within higher education can only lead to a situation where many of our brightest and most talented students do not have role models at the highest levels. Developments such as the Senior Academic Leadership Initiative (SALI) and the appointment of female presidents are importantly increasing the visibility of female leaders in higher education. The SALI will create 45 new senior academic leadership posts in higher education institutions (HEIs) across Ireland by 2022, simultaneously increasing the number of women involved in decision-making processes and addressing issues of significant under-representation of women in certain disciplines. The response from HEIs has been overwhelmingly positive to the initiative and the pool of highly talented candidates who have applied for the 20 posts already funded has been impressive.Latest figures published by the HEA show that women account for 26 per cent of professors in Irish universities. While this is an increase from the 19 per cent reported in 2016, there is still a long way to go to reach gender balance at senior levels. Currently, we see an annual increase of about 1 per cent in the proportion of senior female leaders, and the SALI is predicted to contribute an extra 4 per cent increase on top of that by 2023.While the number of female staff in senior leadership positions grabs the headlines, advancing gender equality is about changing institutional and departmental cultures. The Athena Swan charter has helped drive policies in this area and achieving an award is now a requirement for colleges to remain eligible to receive public research funding. Since the HEA review of gender equality in higher education in 2016, much progress has been made nationally. HEIs must now ensure gender balance across all decision-making groups and all publicly funded HEIs must have gender-equality action plans in place.Women face a number of barriers to progression because of numerous factors within HEIs, conscious and unconscious, cultural and structural, which are not experienced to the same degree by their male colleagues. In recent years, HEIs have taken important steps to address this, such as: reviewing their recruitment and promotion policies ensuring that gender-neutral language is used in all material and resources relating to recruitment and promotion delivering equality and ersity training for all staff members acting as interview panellists or conducting performance reviews ensuring a minimum of 40 per cent of each gender on interview and selection panels and advertising their equality and flexible working policies.HarassmentHowever, gaps still remain. For instance, from an equality perspective, we also know that harassment can seriously affect the careers of young female academics. More work needs to be done to tackle this issue and the HEA, at the request of Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris, has recently established an expert advisory group focused on ending sexual violence and harassment in higher education.Gender inequality has never been more apparent than in the last year, when we have seen female staff disproportionately affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. For instance, the research time lost due to the necessity to move to an online mode of teaching delivery, combined with the increased burden of caring responsibilities (which disproportionately fall on female staff), has the potential to further delay career progression for female academic staff. Internationally, evidence has emerged that, since the start of the Covid-19 restrictions, women researchers are submitting fewer academic papers than men.In 2016, the HEA expert group outlined the following vision for Irish higher education: “By investing in gender equality, Irish higher education institutions will maximise their pursuit of excellence and successfully meet the many social, economic and cultural challenges of the future.” This statement takes on renewed significance in the context of the current crisis and it is crucial that gender-equality initiatives are continued and that any national or institutional strategies or policies in response to Covid-19 are gender-proofed. In this context, the HEA will carry out a second national review of gender equality in higher education later this year."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4530052.1617710343!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teachers unions agree joint campaign on vaccine priority list","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMove will not affect planned reopening of schools on April 12th, according to unions. File photograph: Alan BetsonAll three teachers’ unions have agreed to a joint motion backing measures up to industrial action if the Government does not prioritise their members for vaccination.In a joint statement on Tuesday morning, the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO), the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) and the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) confirmed that the emergency motion would be placed before their conferences on Wednesday.“The motion will seek to commit the unions to work together to demand vaccine prioritisation for teachers. Should that fail, the motion will mandate the unions to explore any and all options, up to and including industrial action,” the three unions said in a joint statement.Any industrial action will not affect the planned reopening of schools on April 12th, according to the unions. However, it could disrupt the current academic year at primary level or the new school year in September at second level.The row follows the Government’s decision last week to introduce an age-based system for vaccinating the population instead of one that prioritises frontline professions.Speaking on the opening morning of the TUI annual conference, which is taking place online as a result of Covid-19 restrictions, the union president Martin Marjoram, said the Department of Education had made clear commitments on vaccine allocation.“On February 10th and again on February 23rd, correspondence from the Department of Education to the system – on which TUI was consulted in advance – gave clear indication of our place in the prioritisation and indeed offered hope that department representations would see frontline school staff vaccinated at the earliest possible opportunity within that first third,” Mr Marjoram said.“We have never sought to be advanced above those most vulnerable to infection or the most serious consequences thereof, but we must insist that commitments made on such sensitive issues be honoured.”At the opening of the INTO congress, union president Mary Magner called on the Government to reverse last week’s decision.“We had a promise from the Government we took in good faith. However, the rug has been pulled out from under us,” she said.“We will spend time later in congress on this important matter and I implore the Minister to announce a U-turn in her address later.”Expert guidanceA spokesman for Minister for Education Norma Foley – who is due to address the INTO on Tuesday afternoon – said it remained her position that the vaccination programme should be guided by public health experts.The Government is resisting pressure to move teachers up its vaccination schedule in the face of moves by the unions to back ballots for strike action.A Government spokesman said on Monday the latest vaccination sequencing is “based on medical advice to protect the most medically vulnerable in society”.“The evidence has shown age is by far the biggest factor in serious illness, hospitalisation and mortality due to Covid-19,” the spokesman said.“Many essential workers have played an important part since the start of the pandemic. The National Immunisation Advisory Committee has explained the rationale to various stakeholders and based on the medical advice this is the safest and swiftest way to roll the vaccine programme out.”Senior Government sources indicated on Monday that a reversal on the new vaccine priority list was not likely. Several sources said the new list was the “fastest and fairest way” to roll out the vaccines and had been recommended by public health experts.Senior Coalition sources said many essential workers had worked throughout the pandemic and argued other groups could make claims for early vaccination if it bowed to teachers’ demands.One source said there was “no sense in Government that anyone wants to do a U-turn on this”.Anger and frustrationThe unions, however, say there is widespread anger and frustration over the “downgrading” of the teaching profession on the vaccination list.Unions, as well as representative bodies for gardaí, want the Government to introduce a parallel process which would see those in frontline roles receive their vaccines in separate streams at mass centres. This would run side by side with the system in place for the general public.The INTO is pushing for potential industrial action in May or June. Secondary teachers’ unions are reluctant to disrupt the Leaving Cert and say any action would likely be early in the new academic year.However, Government and health service sources believe such a move would result in pressure for similar arrangements for tens of thousands of retail and transport workers, among others.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Move follows scientific expert group\u0026rsquos conclusion that \u0026lsquothe fuel qualifies as sustainable\u0026rsquo under green investmentsAs the Swedish environmental activist turns 18, what next for her \u0026lsquowe children\u0026rsquo message?Demand for wood is three times higher than the country\u0026rsquos potential sustainable supply"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Celtic Mist, donated by the Haughey family, now serving as a research vessel for conservation body"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.NEWS AND UPDATES: - How many have been vaccinated here?Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 271,524 had received their second dose.Some 189,094 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 338,083 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 361,359 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp43,455 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 600 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.On Thursday, March 18th, the EMA announced it had found\u0026nbspno causal link between the vaccine and blood-clotting events and use of the vaccine\u0026nbspresumed on Saturday March 20th in Ireland.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4530078.1617713774!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"number of covid 19 cases linked to outdoor transmission may be underestimate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Walkers on Sandymount Strand enjoying the sunshine and warmer weather in Dublin. File photograph: Alan BetsonFigures showing 0.1 per cent of Covid-19 cases in the State come from outdoor transmission may be an underestimate, a professor of immunovirology has said.Prof Liam Fanning of University College Cork said he was surprised by the figures and felt there could be a “slight bias” in the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) data on cases linked to outdoor transmission.Figures from the HPSC showed just one confirmed case of Covid-19 in every thousand is traced to outdoor transmission.Of the 232,164 cases of Covid-19 recorded in the State up to March 24th this year, 262 were as a result of outdoor transmission, representing 0.1 per cent of the total, the data revealed. There were 42 outbreaks associated with outdoor gatherings, with one community outbreak accounting for seven cases.Speaking to Newstalk Breakfast on Tuesday, Prof Fanning said there was an obvious difference in transmission rates of the virus between outdoor and indoor locations.He cautioned that meeting people outdoors still posed a risk, as the virus could be spread if someone infectious was “face-on chatting” to other iniduals.People should try to avoid speaking directly face-to-face and instead attempt to speak to each other while side by side when outdoors, a common method used during the Spanish flu, he said.Prof Fanning said financial support to encourage more outdoor dining spaces should also be “much higher”, given the low transmission rates outdoors.At present, restaurants, cafes and bars are restricted to delivery or takeaway services only, with no outdoor dining permitted.The Government plans to invest €17 million in upgrades for local authorities and businesses to help create outdoor dining spaces.Under a new scheme, businesses will be able to apply for grants of up to €4,000 each to invest in outdoor seating and other amenities.International dataOrla Hegarty, assistant professor of architecture at University College Dublin, said the Irish figures on outdoor transmission were not robust but they were in line with data from other countries. She said a study in China found that only three out of 1,200 cases examined were transmitted out of doors.She told RTÉ radio 1’s Today with Philip Boucher-Hayes that “outdoor events need a lot of protection around them, people need to realise that close conversations can be high risk, that sharing a car or a taxi or a bus to get there can be very high risk.Epidemiologist Patricia Kearney told the same programme that finding out where someone got infected is “much more difficult” than discovering who they passed the virus on to.“It’s not just about finding the sources, it’s really doing an investigation – public health risk assessment to try and figure out is that where the infection could have arisen. It is positive that we’re starting to do that but it really requires the kind of expert local knowledge that exists in our regional departments of public health, so I think it will be quite some time before we get to resolve some of the mystery surrounding some of the community transmission.“In Australia they use the term ‘mystery cases’ for community transmission and I think it is quite a useful way of thinking about the challenge,” Prof Kearney said.Hospital patientsThere were 263 patients in hospital with Covid-19, as of 8pm on Monday, according to the Health Service Executive’s (HSE) daily operations report.Fifty-five Covid-19 patients were in intensive care units, compared with 65 seven days ago.There were 320 positive cases of Covid-19 reported on Monday, and no deaths related to the virus, according to the National Public Health Emergency Team.The HSE expects to surpass the milestone of administering the one millionth Covid-19 vaccine dose in the Republic this week.In a post on Twitter, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said Ireland was making “huge progress” tackling the pandemic.Mr Donnelly said one in six adults had received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and the country had “one of the lowest rates of Covid-19 in Europe” at present.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4530107.1617714785!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"slight decrease in number of people staying within 10km of home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhile 79.2 per cent of Dublin residents remained within 10km, just 49.5 per cent of Roscommon inhabitants did the same.

Photograph: Toms KalninsEPA The European Commission has denied a report that the European Union blocked the export of 3.1 million doses of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines to Australia. Italy previously blocked an export of 250,000 AstraZeneca doses to Australia, under new controls that require manufacturers which have vaccine contracts with the EU to apply for permission to export them to certain countries.“There has been no further development since then,” European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said when asked about the report. “We can certainly not confirm any new decision to block exports to Australia or for any other country for that matter.”An Australian government source, who declined to be named because he is not authorised to talk about the matter, told Reuters that the EU “blocked 3.1 million shots so far”.“We haven’t given up hope but we’ve stopped counting them in our expected supplies,” the source said.Under the export control system, companies with a supply contract with the EU that wish to export vaccines from the bloc must seek permission from the government of the country where the factory that finishes the doses is located.The European Commission can support or override the export request, which is evaluated on the basis of whether the company has an unmet contract to supply vaccines to the EU. Exports to developing countries are exempt from the controls.The system was recently tightened to allow authorities to refuse exports on the basis that the destination has a higher vaccination rate or if it is not allowing exports in the other direction.So far Italy’s blocking of the 250,000 doses to Australia is the only one of 491 vaccine export requests to be refused, according to EU figures. There are seven pending requests, but these are not thought to relate to AstraZeneca deliveries to Australia.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has said that AstraZeneca must “catch up” with deliveries of promised doses to the EU before the company exports vaccines.The British-Swedish company delivered just under 30 million doses to the EU by the end of March, instead of more than 100 million vaccines initially expected, and has severely cut expected deliveries for the second quarter as well.Behind scheduleAustralia’s inoculation campaign is well behind its original schedule, with only about 670,000 people inoculated against an initial target of 4 million by end-March.Prime minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday that missing shipments were responsible for the country not meeting its inoculation schedule.“In early January, we anticipated we would have the 3.1 million vaccines. Those vaccines were not supplied to Australia,” Mr Morrison told reporters in Canberra. “That is the reason.”Australia has recorded 909 coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began and said on Tuesday it would launch a quarantine and test-free travel bubble with New Zealand this month after effectively eradicating the virus by closing borders last year.While the government blamed the slow rollout on supply issues from Europe, Australian state governments have also complained about slower-than-expected distribution and a lack of certainty on supplies. – Additional reporting from ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4530028.1617699248!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hundreds of hikers evacuate icelandic volcano as new fissure opens","story":"March 23rd: Drone footage captures crowds flocking to witness lava pouring from a volcano that has erupted near Iceland\u0027s capital Reykjavik.

Local residents said they had become attached to it.The CDFW spokesman said: Physically and mentally, the bear just didn’t seem quite right, walking oddly, dull and not responsive like a normal bear should be.It was taken to a laboratory where veterinarians could observe the animal.They found it had intermittent head tremors and a tilted head, indicating neurological abnormalities.The bear was also only one quarter of the weight of an average black bear of its age.It was eventually euthanised and a post-mortem examination was carried out.Scientists found encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain usually caused by a virus. the fourth such recent case in the area.Dr Brandon Munk, a  CDFW vet, said: At this point, we don’t know what causes the encephalitis so we don’t know what, if any, health risks these bears might pose to other animals.Young black bears with the condition were previously identified in neighbouring Nevada.The Nevada Department of Wildlife said there had been a growing number of encounters in the forested Tahoe Basin area, between humans and bears displaying neurological abnormalities.Vets and biologists from the two states\u0027 wildlife agencies met this month to assess the problem.They have discovered five new viruses while examining the affected bears, but don\u0027t know if any of those was responsible.California\u0027s black bear population has tripled over the last four decades, and is now up to 40,000.Bears have become less inhibited around people, and wandering into gardens and homes looking for food has become more common.Their proximity to humans has also raised fears of a virus jumping species.However, Jamie Sherman, a University of California veterinarian, told the Sacramento Bee newspaper: “The viruses that they detected in these bears were not ones particularly known to affect humans.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ivf clinics exploiting women raising prices pandemic","story":"Women who feel the pandemic has robbed them of their chance to have children are being exploited by IVF clinics charging “eye-watering” prices, the head of Britain’s fertility watchdog has warned.Sally Cheshire, former chairman of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) urged ministers to give the regulator stronger powers to protect those seeking to start a family from false claims. Mrs Cheshire, who has just stood down as chairman, after 15 years at the HFEA, said that repeated lockdowns meant many of those seeking to find a partner, and start a family, felt they had “lost a year of their lives”.In an interview with The , she said too many clinics were trading on the desperation of those struggling with fertility, promoting unproven techniques and exaggerating statistics about effectiveness. Mrs Cheshire urged the Government to overhaul legislation that is now 30 years old - predating the commercial market in fertility - by giving the watchdog the power to set prices, and to fine clinics who make false claims. “This would mean there wasn\u0027t exploitation for self-funded patients going to private clinics and that prices don\u0027t all reach the eye-watering levels that we have seen,” she said.Some centres are charging as much as £20,000 per cycle, warned the HFEA chief, who said she would set a limit of around £5,000. And she said too many clinics were still making claims - in particular about costly and unproven “add-on treatments” - which could not be justified. “They need to think really carefully about what they\u0027re offering, particularly when the success rates are still lower than we would expect. It\u0027s a false promise,” she said. Latest HFEA figures show the number of women freezing their eggs has risen almost ten-fold since 2010. The official statistics, which show almost 2,000 freezing cycles in 2018, predate the pandemic, but clinics have said inquiries tripled at some centres last year compared with 2019.“Lots of people feel like they’ve lost their chance lost a year of their lives, women who are who are older who are coming up to the cut-off age for fertility treatment, the couples or women who had planned to have treatment this year and haven\u0027t been able to, and those who feel that their chances has come and gone, because they are now over the age for NHS funding.”“I think this has had a devastating impact, with people who see their dreams of having a family disappear,” she said. While clinics were only forced to close completely for the first month of lockdown, some NHS services were closed for longer as staff were erted to deal with Covid, she said. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that women who are struggling to conceive naturally should be funded for three cycles of IVF, if they are below the age of 40, with one for those aged 40 to 42. But just 12 per cent of areas provide this. The legislation behind the creation of the HFEA 30 years ago assumed that the sector was state-funded, but NHS rationing means the vast majority of fertility treatment is privately funded now, she said. “We need to have some curbs on that commercial competitive environment, given two-thirds of fertility patients fund their own treatment,” she said. But Mrs Cheshire said she would like her successor to be given more powers than she has had, in setting the rates charged by the private sector, and putting protection of patients at the heart of its role. “We don’t have powers such as economic sanctions, we don’t have powers over patient funding, and we would want to see regulatory powers which allow us to support care which is ethical and effective, as well as safe about quality of care, which isn’t mentioned at all in the original act,” she said. In the short-term, the regulator will use existing powers to “we try and stamp out as much exploitation as we can,” she said. In May, new guidance from the Competition and Markets Authority and the Advertising Standards Authority will set out rules instructing clinics not to make false unsubstantiated claims, or “unrealistically low headline prices” which gloss over the true costs. Mrs Cheshire said she is particularly concerned about the need to address the use of social media to target those vulnerable to exaggerated claims. “Social media has had a huge impact in targeting certain groups of women - so women of a certain age get targeted with ads about egg freezing for example,” she said. “Looking at challenges for the future, there is something about protecting vulnerable patients, in a competitive and commercial environment,” she said. The HFEA has cautioned against the use of “add-on” treatments which promise to boost standard fertility treatment, such as endometrial glue and scratches the most common. Their research found that two in three patients undergoing fertility treatment will pay for some such treatment, despite a lack of evidence to support them. Mrs Cheshire said: “I think all clinicians have a duty to be honest with their patients about the safety or potential harms and the effectiveness of those treatments. “We do know that when patients are vulnerable, particularly when you\u0027re older, or when you feel like your might be your last chance your time is running out, it can be very easy for you to accept whatever is discussed with you, or offered to you.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"spare us hypocrisy woke multinationals","story":"Perhaps I’m not the best person to sound off about boycotting Coca-Cola since I hardly drink it. I mean, if you put dirty coins in Coca-Cola they come out shiny – so just imagine what that does to your insides. But in the US, Coca-Cola, along with Delta Air Lines, is now in the front line of the culture wars. Donald Trump has urged Republicans to boycott them, due to their opposition to Republican-led reforms to the electoral system in Georgia.The main thrust of the reforms is that voters would need photo ID or a utility bill to back a request for an absentee vote, instead of the present system where the signature on the application for the vote is checked against that on the returned ballot. This reform, however, is being treated by Democrats as, to use President Biden’s analogy, a return to Jim Crow laws, which enforced racial segregation. Now James Quincey, Coca-Cola’s British chief executive, declares that the changes are “unacceptable”.It’s yet another example of corporate ethical activism, whereby companies get terrifically worked up about issues that have really got nothing to do with them. It’s part of corporate overreach generally. In Ireland, during the referendum on gay marriage, Google and Facebook let it be known that they were very pro-change. Then there was Disney, making a stand against transphobia by, in an entirely pointless gesture, sacking the actress Gina Carano from The Mandalorian after she appeared to send up trans pronouns. This is the same Disney that filmed part of their live-action version of Mulan in Xinjiang province, where the Uyghurs are in mass detention.I’d love to boycott Disney but I haven’t watched one since Beauty and the Beast, the last decent film it made.Where global capitalism does have an ethical duty, it is to pay taxes in the countries where they operate, reflecting the profits they make there. But on this, Google et al are not terribly forthcoming either. My impression is that they positively go out of their way to avoid paying what normal people would consider a fair rate and use their corporate clout with the US government to argue their case.They also have a responsibility to see that their supply chains are clean, viz, that the companies contributing to their product aren’t involved in iffy practices in developing countries or underpaying their workers.You might even assume that big corporations would consider the ethics of investing in countries that violate human rights. And yet Coca-Cola’s Curt Ferguson, head of its Far East operations, recently declared that its biggest market in the future would be China, where it already employs thousands of people.The difference, of course, is that taking a stand on China really would affect the bottom line. Ethics and global capitalism… they’re a funny mix, aren’t they?Yesterday, in Scotland people headed back to the hairdressers looking like so many Rapunzels. On Monday, it’ll be the turn of salons in England. Yet I’ve been enjoying seeing what men look like, liberated from the tyranny of short back and sides. Some look just unkempt, others quite lovely.I have a colleague who unexpectedly grew luxuriant curls, which went nicely with his beard he looked like the emperor Hadrian.

In the context of the vaccine bounce, the Conservatives should take this seat.Mike Hill, the current MP, resigned his seat following allegations of sexual harassment, which he denies. His majority was substantially reduced at the 2019 election after Richard Tice, chairman of the Brexit Party, stood in the seat and took a quarter of the vote share.Survation’s poll of 502 voters, commissioned by the Communication Workers Union (CWU), suggests almost all of the Brexit Party share from 2019 will go to the Conservative Party. The Liberal Democrats, Reform UK and Green Party all stand at 1 per cent of the vote.The seat last returned a Tory candidate in 1959, and swung back to Labour in the 1964 general election.In response to Labour’s apparent admittal of defeat, a Tory source said: The only poll that matters is the one on 6th May.The poll appears to support the idea that Boris Johnson will experience a vaccine bounce at the local elections, as voters reward the Conservative Party for the UK’s comparative success in the global race to vaccinate voters.Sir Keir’s net favourability rating with Labour voters is 30 in Hartlepool, while Mr Johnson’s rating among Tory voters is 80.A separate question in the poll found that 69 per cent of Hartlepool voters support a policy of free broadband - a manifesto commitment of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour in 2019.A majority also support renationalising Royal Mail and believe that investing in public services should be a higher government priority than paying off the deficit.Dave Ward, the leader of the CWU, told The Times: The fact that Hartlepool might elect a Tory MP for the first time since 1959 suggests to me that rather than rebuilding the red wall, Labour might be about to lose more of it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watchhikers evacuated lava spurts new crack iceland volcanos","story":"Hundreds of hikers have been evacuated after lava spouted from a new crack in an Icelandic volcano\u0027s surface on Monday in the Reykjanes peninsula.The Icelandic Department of Emergency Management announced an immediate evacuation of the area. There was no imminent danger to life due to the site’s distance from hiking paths, officials said, but they announced an immediate evacuation of the area.A steady stream of tourists have visited the area since the long-dormant volcano on the Reykjanes Peninsula in southwest Iceland flared to life in March. According to the Icelandic Tourist Board, around 30,000 people have visited the area since the eruption began to view the spectacle.   The volcano began erupting last month and was the area’s first volcanic eruption in nearly 800 years.For more videos from the , subscribe to our YouTube channel. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"everywhere you wont need covid","story":"NewsEverywhere you will and wont need a Covid vaccine passport - and when theyd kick inCovid certication looks pretty certain for gigs, theatre and sports matches and wont happen on public transport or supermarkets.

Widely dubbed vaccine passports, they could in fact also showyouaposve had a recent test, or you have natural immunity from being infected in the past. Itaposs claimed these certicates could help Brits get back to some level of normality when other restrictions ease this summer. But theyaposve prompted a revolt from Tory MPs, after ministers claimed we aim to remove all legal limits on social contact and restore our freedoms from June . Labour MPs also have concerns on civil liberties grounds, and fears about how the system will actually work. There is no start date for a Covid passport, no final design, and a promise that you wonapost need it to go to a pub when beer gardens open in England on Monday. So what is the debate actually about and what might passports look like  Hereaposs what you need to know. What is a Covid passport  A aposvaccine passportapos is a catch-all term for a system where people prove they are Covid safe to get into a venue, travel or work setting. The government calls it Covid certication because it wonapost just mean showing youaposve had a vaccine. You could also show youaposve got natural immunity, or have had a recent negative Covid test. For this reason, the government doesnapost like using the term aposvaccine passportapos because it over-simplies what weaposre talking about. But weaposre using the phrase here to explain it, because itaposs already entered common use.  How would it work  The NHS is working on providing both digital and non-digital ways for you to show your vaccine, testing or antibody status in a Covid aposcerticateapos or apospassportapos. Itaposs understood this may use a re-worked version of the NHS Covid- app, which has already been downloaded more than million times for testing and venue check-ins. The tool could show one or all of three things to certy your Covid status:Your up-to-date vaccine record Whether youaposve had a negative lateral flowor PCRtest, taken on the same day or the day before your admission to a venue Proof of natural immunity, such as through a previous positive PCR test no less than  days ago, as long as youaposve completed the self-isolation period.Why are they being developed For foreign travel itaposs obvious - other countries will demand a vaccine status to allow entry to Brits. But for domestically within the UK itaposs more complicated. Ministers had claimed domestic passport were discrimination and would not happen, but have since U-turned. Explaining the massive change of heart, the government said it had to act because pubs and other venues would start asking for peopleaposs Covid status regardless. Even without Government intervention, COVID-status certication is likely to become a feature of our lives until the threat from the pandemic recedes, the government says. Likewise, in the UK, businesses and other organisations are able to ask customers for proof of COVID- status in order to access their premises, as long as they are compliant with equalities legislation. The Government believes that introducing a ban on this would in most cases be an unjustied intrusion on how businesses choose to make their premises safe.  Where will youprobablyneed a Covid passport The government says certication is most likely at ticketed events, such as:Theatres Nightclubs Mass events such as festivals or sports eventsThataposs because large numbers of people are brought together in close proximity. Wheremightyou need a Covid passport  The government has not ruled out introducing Covid passports - or allowing them to be used by inidual businesses - such as:Pubs Restaurants Cafes Bars Non-essential shops like clothes shops.The review says certication could play a role in reducing social distancing requirements in other settings which people tend to visit more frequently, for example in hospitality settings. This could mean, for example, that you have to show a Covid passport at your local pub in exchange for the rule of six being dropped indoors from June . Downing Street has refused to rule out requiring or allowing them in non-essential retail like clothes shops.But the government has ruled out any chance of passports being needed in hospitality venues before June . You will not have to show a Covid passport when beer gardens reopen in England on April , or when indoor areas of pubs reopen from May . The review adds: The Government recognises this has signicant implications for businesses and their customers. So this will be further considered in consultation with industry.Where will you definitelynotneed a Covid passport There are some settings where the government says Covid passports should never be required. This is in order to ensure access for all. They include:Essential public services Public transport Essential shopsWhen will passports be introduced  We donapost have an exact date, but we do have a few big clues. Firstly, we know passports will be trialled through the Events Research Programme, which is piloting new ways of bringing back crowds for big events. The programme runs from April to May  , so we know widespread passports wonapost happen before then. Secondly, we know further proposals will be presented to Parliament in late April. Thirdly, we know big events like gigs and sports fixtures can only resume from May  at the earliest anyway - so passports wonapost be brought in before that. Fourthly, the government has specically guaranteed you wonapost need passports in hospitality venues - like pubs - any earlier than June . In May, you will be able to go inside the pub and enjoy your drink, and there is no question of a vaccine certication being asked for, said Nadhim Zahawi. So it seems any passport scheme is months away, unless you happen to be going to one of the pilot events over the next six weeks. It could be introduced as early as mid-May for big events, but no earlier than June  for pubs. What about people who canapost get vaccines for medical reasons  Itaposs unclear so far. The government is still working on how to ensure people arenapost discriminated againsttheyaposre unable to get the vaccine. There are also questions over whether vaccine passports will be needed for children - who generally arenapost being given the jab. The government accepts: It is important that there are appropriate exemptions for people for whom vaccination is not advised and repeat testing is dficult. Equally, the Government wants to be sure that the benefits of any such approach are fully interrogated in public debate and that the deliverability of COVID-status certication is rigorously tested, along with analysis of the potential economic impacts that COVID-status certication would have across dferent settings.

And he gave an update on progress towards introducing vaccine passports and unlocking overseas travel this year. International travel, aside from a few exceptions, remains illegal until at least May . But the PM announced that when it reopens, it will be on a “traffic lights” basis, with people allowed tofrom “green” rated countries without any kind of quarantine or isolation. However, the government advised weary Brits to hold off on booking summer holidays for the time being. The Government also published an update on Covid certicate plans, with trials of negative test certicates due to start at sport and comedy events later this month. Boris Johnson said the lockdown changes in England were fully justied but urged the public not to be complacent. The Prime Minister told a Downing Street press briefing: We think that these changes are fully justied by the data, which shows that we are meeting our four tests for easing the lockdown. But - and you know Iaposm going to say this - we canapost be complacent. We can see the waves of sickness afflicting other countries and weaposve seen how this story goes. We still donapost know how strong the vaccine shield will be when cases begin to rise, as Iaposm afraid they will, and thataposs why weaposre saying please get your vaccine or your second dose when the turn comes. And please use the free NHS tests evenyou donapost feel ill. The PM said he did not think, based on the current data, that there would be any deviation from his road map out of lockdown - despite worrying data being published by SAGE earlier today, which suggested a delay could be possible.  Mr Johnson said: We set out our road map and weaposre sticking with it. And I want to stress that we see nothing in the present data that makes us think that we will have to deviate from that road map. But it is by being cautious, by monitoring the data at every stage and by following the rules - remembering hand, face, space, fresh air - that we hope together to make this road map to freedom irreversible. Hereaposs a roundup of all the things youaposll be able to do from next Monday - and all the updates on the reviews on foreign travel and vaccine passports. What will reopen and when From April , the following will reopen:Non-essential retail Outdoor hospitality - including pub beer gardens Personal care premises such as hairdressers and nail salons Public buildings, including libraries and community centres Indoor leisure facilities such as gymsMost outdoor attractions, including zoos, theme parks, and drive-in cinemas Self-contained accommodation such as campsites and holiday lets, where indoor facilities are not shared with other householdsAdditionally, parent and child groups of up to  peoplecan restart indoors. The number of care home visitors will also increase to two per resident. And all children will be able to attend any indoor childrenaposs activity, including sport - though soft play facilities will remain closed until step . Will I still have to order a apossubstantial mealapos to get a drink in a beer garden  No. Hospitality venues will be able to open for outdoor service, with no requirement for a substantial meal to be served alongside alcohol, and no curfew. But the requirement to eat and drink while seated will remain - including when ordering. And social contact rules will continue to apply, with outdoor gatherings still limited to  people or  households. Will the rules on weddings and funerals change  Weddings, outdoor receptions, and commemorative events including wakes will now be able to take place with up to  attendees. The limit on attendees at a funeral will remain at . International travel How will the traffic light system work  Travellers arriving from countries rated green will not be required to isolate - although pre-departure and post-arrival tests will still be needed. For those classed as amber or red, the restrictions will remain as they are, with arrivals required to isolate or enter quarantine. Countries will be rated green when the government judges the risk to be lower, based for instance on vaccinations, infection rates, the prevalence of iants of concern, and their genomic sequencing capacity . Which countries will be green  The Taskforce says it is still too early to predict which countries would be on which list and they continue to advise against booking summer holidays abroad. They said: These decisions will be driven by the data and evidence nearer the time, which we cannot predict now. And countries wonapost necessarily stay in the category theyaposre first assigned. The Taskforce said countries will move between the red, amber and green lists depending on the data.

The government has announced that “stage two” of lting lockdown restrictions can go ahead as planned, because the four tests are being met. The PM said moving on to the next step was fully justied due to the success of the vaccine rollout, and the drop in coronavirus cases and hospitalisations. That means more businesses will reopen – including shops, hairdressers, beauty salons, gyms and pubs. So what comes next and what can you do from Monday, April   We look at vaccine passports, summer holidays and other landmarks on the roadmap out of lockdown. What will change with step  of the lockdown roadmap  The Government has confirmed all changes pencilled in for April  will go ahead. Non-essential shops can reopen, along with hairdressers and beauty salons. Pubs and restaurants can serve customers outdoors. Gyms can reopen, as can zoos, theme parks, libraries and museums. Holidays in England will be allowed – but only in self-catered accommodation. Indoor social mixing between dferent households is still banned until May  at the earliest. But scientists yesterday cast doubt that the next stages of easing – on May  and June  – will go ahead as planned. Should I still work from home   If you can work from home then you should, despite the aposstay at homeapos order lting on  March. Use of public transport is allowed for any reason but people are advised to minimise how often they take the bus or the underground. The work from home guidance is only expected to change from June  at the earliest – with many employers not planning to have staff back for months more. Can I go to the pub yet  It will be another few days before punters canto beer gardens for a long-awaited pint with hospitality venues also be able to serve takeaway drinks from April . However limits around social contact will remain in place, so you have to abide by the rule of six or apostwo householdapos limits. Indoor areas of pubs, restaurants and cafes will not be allowed to open until Step  of the roadmap, from May  at the earliest. Drinkers may have to show proof of vaccination or a negative test. What about hugging my Grandma   Even though you can meet outdoors, government scientists are still warning people not to hug those not in their household or bubble. You should maintain two-metre social distancing where possible, or one metre with mitigations. This rule is only due to be reviewed ahead of May , when many more Brits will have had a first dose of the vaccine. Even then, you should think twice about putting vulnerable loved ones at risk. Can I visit relatives in a care home   Care home residents in England will be allowed two regular visitors indoors from  April. Currently people in care homes can have just one face-to-face visitor, but as part of the next step of lockdown easing it will be extended to two. They will be able to hold hands - but visitors must be tested and wear PPE. Visitors will also be able to bring babies and young children with them, meaning some residents could meet grandchildren for the first time as community infection rates drop and the vaccine rollout continues. Can I book my summer holiday   Foreign travel is currently illegal under lockdown rules, except in limited circumstances such as for work or to attend a funeral, with ministers reviewing how it can resume from May  at the earliest. But staycations in England are allowed from April  - as long as you stay in self-contained accommodation with your own household. Holidays with other households in England will not be allowed until at least May . You canapost travel to stay overnight with friends and family before that date. Will I have to take regular Covid testing   All adults in England are going to be offered free, twice-weekly tests – and ministers say they will be key to the continued easing of lockdown. The lateral flow tests - which can provide results in around  minutes - will be available from Friday, regardless of whether people have symptoms. Anybody in England will be able to order a test kit to their home, pick one up at a local site or through a workplace or school programme. But there are some concerns over  positives which could suggest the disease is making a comeback. Will le finally go back to normal on June   Boris Johnson suggested le will begin to get back to “some semblance” of normality from step  of the roadmap but this will rely on twice-weekly Covid testing, vaccine passports, the jabs roll-out and new iants that may arrive from abroad.Scientists yesterday cast doubt on whether Covid rules can be fully relaxed on June , warning that some restrictions such as social distancing may have to be maintained until this time next year.Vaccine passportsWhat are vaccine passports   The certicates would prove whether you have had a jab, a negative Covid test or a recent antibody test to prove immunity from the virus. The idea is to provide reassurance that you are less likely to spread the virus. The NHS is looking at digital options for proof of Covid status, such as an app on your phone, and the existing NHS app could be used. Paper certicates are also being considered to make sure people without smartphones are not excluded. Will it be used for foreign holidays   Vaccine passports were originally considered for this reason, as some countries may require travellers to prove they have had the jab. The Government wanted to develop some sort of proof of vaccine status so British holidaymakers wouldn’t miss out. Travellers are already required to get Covid tests before going abroad and many countries will ask for proof of a negative result, so the certicate could help with this. What about at football matches and big events  The idea will be trialled as part of pilots for managing theof crowds to big events. Initial pilots starting this month on events like the FA Cup semi final and the World Snooker Championships will focus on pre-arrival tests. But later pilots will include data on vaccination and immunity, the Government says. Officials think the idea could factor into allowing more spectators at concerts, theatre shows and sports matches, as well as allowing social distancing rules to be relaxed. Will I need it in the pub  Pubs and restaurants are not expected to ask for Covid certicates when they start reopening for outdoor hospitality next week. But the Government hasn’t ruled it out. The review says the Government cannot ban businesses for asking customers to provide proof of their Covid status - as long as they comply with equalities rules. What about shops and public transport  Shops, public transport and other essential services will never ask for vaccine passports to ensure fair access for all, the Government says. Ministers are worried about excluding people for vital services so the review is clear that “some settingswhere Covid-status certication should never be required”. Do other countries use them   Ministers have been looking at the “Green Pass” used in Israel, which allows fully vaccinated citizens to go to hotels, gyms and theatres. Denmark has developed a “Coronapas” to use domestically to allow people to access services such as hairdressers, restaurants and cinemas. Will MPs get a vote on it   Yes. The Government says interim findings will be presented to Parliament later this month to ensure the plan is properly scrutinised. The Prime Minister could face a revolt from MPs over the plan as  Tories have expressed concern. Labour and the Liberal Democrats are also worried about the idea.Why are people concerned  There are ethical concerns that the plan could lay the groundwork for making people show their ID at all times - a move which has traditionally been resisted.  There are issues about privacy and security of people’s sensitive health data. Fears have also been raised about possible discrimination against people who cannot get the jab for medical reasons or younger people still waiting their turn.Foreign travelWill international travel resume as planned   Boris Johnson sounded pretty cautions on foreign travel yesterday as cases continue to soar across Europe, prompting fears of new iants arriving in the UK. The PM said he was “hopeful” of getting going after May  but does not “wish to give hostages to fortune”. Leaving the UK without an essential reason – such as work or a family bereavement - is currently illegal. Can I book a holiday abroad  For the moment, the Government is advising people not to book summer holidays abroad until the picture is clearer. The global travel taskforce, chaired by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will publish details of the new traffic light system later this week. An official review published yesterday said ministers still hoped people would be able to take a summer holiday abroad this year but warned it was “still too soon to know what is possible” - and that foreign travel could be delayed beyond the middle of May. What will the traffic light system be based on   Once the ban on non-essential travel is lted, the Government is planning a traffic light system determining which countries Brits can visit this summer and under what conditions. It will be based on a range of factors - including the proportion of a given countryaposs population that has been vaccinated, rates of infection, emerging new iants and the countryaposs access to reliable scientic data and genomic sequencing. What will I have to do to travel to a aposgreen listapos country   Quarantine for ing Brits will only be dropped for countries on the green list although they will still have to pay for pre-departure and post-arrival tests. These are likely to be aposgold standardapos PCR tests rather than cheaper lateral flow ones, adding hundreds of pounds to the cost of a family holiday. The document said it was too early to say which countries would be on the green list although ministers expect a limited number at the start. And what about aposamber listapos ones   Travellers from amber list countries where there is a medium risk including from iants will be required to have a pre-departure test, then quarantine on arrival for up to ten days. They will have to take a PCR test on days two and eight with the option of a test on the fth to be released,negative, from quarantine. What will be requiredI travel to a aposred listapos country  British, Irish and third-country nationals with residence rights - including long-term visa holders - face hotel quarantine of up to  daysthey arrive from red list countries at a cost of £, per person, with tests on days two and eight.

In a further twist, one of the conditions that had to be met to gain residency was an income of £, a year - ruling out thousands of UK pensioners living in Spain. While many Brits who were able to sort out residency before the rule-change will be able to continue living the sun-soaked continental dream - others like those who own property or live on boats are seeing theirs dashed. The Mirror spoke to two Brits, and a EU citizen married to one, who say Brexit has left their retirement plans in tatters. The fuming -year-old pensioner, who asked to be anonymous, said despite living in Spain with his Russian partner and their children for two decades they face being separated under the countryaposs new rules.What do you think  Join the debate in the comments below...The pensioner said his only hope of being allowed to stay is to marry his partner as she had a Latvian EU passport so can continue living in Spain. He told The Mirror: We have really been screwed over. I have worked here for years and so has my partner who is still working . She enjoys all the liberties of the United Kingdom legally and we own a home in Spain where she also enjoys all the liberties as she has an EU passport,. We spend four to six months a year in our home in Spain but now I have been discriminated against and must leave after  days and leave her there for as long as she so wishes .  We have always been equal in everything we do but I have been told by the embassy that unless we marry under EU legislation I will not be allowed to stay with my partner and may notto her for a further  days . I need care at my age and I’m dreading being forced to be on my own away from my partner and friends in Spain for such a long time. This oven-ready deal will break many long-term relationships and destroy the long-term plans that many EU UK couples have carefully chosen in the younger lives. A hard-working Brit who owns a villa in Alicante she and her husband had hoped to spend half of every year in the property during their looming retirement. But Marilyn Smyth, from Epping Forest, says their dreams have been all but ruined by Brexit.  Mrs Smyth said the couple bought the villa just over two years ago, placing their faith in the UK government to negotiate a post-Brexit agreement with Spain that would support homeowners in the country. After Brexit, British passport-holders like the Smyths can only travel in Schengen Area countries for up to  days in every -day period. Mrs Smyth said she hoped the UK and Spain would still negotiate special travel arrangements for non-resident Brits whose houses contribute to the tourism economy. She told the Mirror the couple never bought the villa to make a huge profit. She had only hoped that when she retired they would be able spend November to February each year in the villa, while booking guests into it during Spain’s warmer months. Brexit and the coronavirus pandemicaposs blow to travel had left the couple wondering whether they had a future in the villa at all, she said.“I didn’t ever do it to get rich, I did it because I genuinely want people to have a good time. It has been truly fabulous and we really, really care about our guests. Brexit has been a big enough pain - we worried about whether we’d be able to get in - how we’d be able to move around the airport.” Mrs Smyth told the Mirror by the the time she pays for the villaaposs upkeep, including taxes, it costs around £, a year to run the holiday property.They book out the villa in the sun-bleached Costa Blanca town of Benitachell at about £ a night for six guests during the high season, she said. She also throws in a car for guests to use at the villa, which is privately booked only. The dispute resolution consultant speaks fluent Spanish, and said she had always felt welcome as a Brit who spent a lot of time in the country. She worries that unless travel rules change for the scores of Brits who own property in Spain, her dreams of a future there would vanish. Mrs Smyth explained: “I didn’t want Brexit particularly but I didn’t get very distressed about it at all. But as time’s gone on, I’m feeling more and more alarmed because I don’t think enough has been done to ensure that people who have property abroad have been considered.” Meanwhile Bert, who lives in Scotland, is worried about what the Brexit rule changes will mean for people who have spent their careers working towards a le at sea. He and his we own a yacht and base themselves in Greece for months of every year. Living on the yacht and sailing around Europe was a longtime retirement dream that they had worked towards. Bert said: “It is our dream, really, to be able to travel for months - it would really be our le - and it’s not just us - many thousands of people are in the same position.”  Complex rules meaning UK-flagged yachts could have to pay VAT for vessels in both UK and the EU - as well as Schengen travel time limits - could make safe seafaring a nightmare, Bert told the Mirror. The Cruising Associationhas launched a campaign on the issue and is seeking, among other policies, a -day cruising visa for boating communities. Its campaign points out many many Brits keep their vessels moored at marinas and in canals around Europe. Duties and tight travel time limits could force skippers to make dangerousjourneys to Britain to beat visa and VAT deadlines, the CA has warned. Bert, a Dutchman married to a Brit, said the couple were in a tricky position like many inter-continental couples after Brexit. He can sail in the Schengen area all he likes - but his we cannot. She would need to live in the Netherlands for five years with him before she could qualy for a spousal EU passport, Bert explained.From now on, timing their journeys around seasonal weather patterns could mean only shorter trips from Scotland to Europe in the warmer months are possible. And by June  they will need to sail their yacht permanently moored in Greece back to Scotland to avoid added duties, he said. Bert added that he knew people in the boating community who sold up their houses or caravans to live at sea. Many British pensioners he met in Greece had spent the money they would have poured into homes on living on boats. “People think boats mean you are rich, but it’s not always like that,” he said.

Daniel Sims, , discovered the location - dubbed aposHorse Riders Farmapos as the real name is unknown - hidden away in rural Lincolnshire. The YouTuber came across the derelict property after a tip-off from a fellow explorer and was stunned by what he discovered inside. In a video posted to his channel, ious stable blocks can be seen with unruly grass and weeds sprouting between bricks. Daniel, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, then enters the stable blocks and finds them left in ruins.Got a story  Email webnews@mirror.In one, he discovers the letters aposBapos and aposRapos smeared on a white box, which he believes was written using faeces. In another stable, Daniel finds a peculiar diary from , containing a very detailed account of its authoraposs days.The passages cover topics such as the weather, food and drink consumed by the writer and anecdotes from the day.Next to the diary, Daniel finds a photo album with yellowing pictures of the family assumed to have owned the farm. The pictures are largely black and white snaps which the explorer thinks are from the s, s and s. Daniel then climbs into the rundown home for the video on his channel, Bearded Reality.He comes across more photo album as well as trophies and medals. The awards are mostly related to old horse competitions between the s and s, strewn across the floor. Daniel said: I was nervous as I was walking up to the place as, from a distance, it didnapost look abandoned. My initial impression was that it was just an abandoned farm with some ruins and stables left behind. I wasnapost expecting to find anything much. But as I entered the property, I found some trophies and pictures which suggested there was more to the place.  There was also an impressive collection of comic books, including a Beano from . In one room, the explorer finds yet another strange diary. This guy was really meticulous about his le - he documented everything, every day, Daniel can be heard saying in the video. In the same room, a blue jacket is hung up on the door of a wardrobe with a rosette pinned to it. After exploring the rest of the upstairs - all of which is in a similar state of disrepair - Daniel heads down to the living room. The dingy room, lit only by his camera light, reveals a shocking scene - a set of two mannequins set up in the lounge. One of the figures is sitting in an armchair while the other is propped up next to a table laid with a tablecloth, tea cups and saucers.

The other has a more formal grey suit, striped trousers and shoes, with the body made using an old Christmas tree. The two figures appear to be enjoying a tea party, which startles the YouTuber. Daniel said: It was really creepy to see. I was not expecting to see that set-up at all and honestly thought it was just some people sat on the coach. My mind has spotted something crazy and thataposs why I retreated back into a dferent room to compose myself. Also on the coffee table is a dusty game of Frustration. It is unclear who set up the unsettling scene.

Marion Wright’s five-page account was written to her dad the day after the disaster in April . She watched from a leboat as the Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg. Marion, who was  at the time, wrote: “It was terrible... I don’t think I shall ever forget it... “We saw the crowds of people when she broke in two which she did a few minutes before she sank going down with a huge explosion over the cries of the people left on board.” She was in her cabin when the “unsinkable” liner struck the iceberg in the north Atlantic. Marion wrote: “I’d been in bed about  minutes when I heard a horric crash which shook the whole vessel and the engine stopped dead. “I put on my dressing gown and a thick coat, I met my friend going on deck to find a reason for the crash.” Marion praised passenger Dr Alfred Pain, , who she had known from her hometown of Yeovil, Somerset. They were travelling separately but met up on board and Dr Pain looked after her on the night of the sinking, helping her into a leboat.  He was one of those who died when the ship went down. Marion said: “My heart goes out to all who were drowned. “Alfred [Pain] who put me in a leboat he was such a nice man and I fear.” She said the gigantic liner at first went “down gradually bit by bit”, adding: “It was awful to watch.” "},{"url":null,"title":"latest lockdown changes explained businesses","story":"NewsLatest lockdown changes explained - and businesses that still cant reopenThe Prime Minister announced on Monday that England will move to Step  of the road map out of lockdown from next week allowing non-essential retail to open among other businessesmirrorShareCommentsByWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video boris-johnson-confirms-non-essential-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:RLFaTQe,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

And he also gave an update on the introduction of vaccine passports and travelling abroad for later this year. Professor Chris Whitty warned that the country will face signicant problems with Covid for the foreseeable future as society is unlocked further from April . Step , which will allow indoor mixing of up to six people or two households and relax outdoor socialising rules, is due to go ahead on May . The fourth and final step, from June , will see all legal limits on mixing removed and the reopening of the last sectors to remain closed, such as nightclubs. The ban on large events will be lted. While some businesses are rejoicing at being told they will re-open next week many indoor venues will stay shut until at least the third step of the roadmap Cinemas, theatres, concert halls and adventure playgrounds are among those who will have to hold their breath with May  earmarked as the next possible date they might once again welcome punters. What wonapost be reopening next week after beer gardens, shops, gyms and hairdressers given go-ahead  -Cinemas Cinemas, as well as other indoor entertainment, will be able to open as part of the third phase of the roadmap. This is still expected to be no earlier than May , but depends on the Covid situation changing.  Drive-in cinemas will be able to open earlier, and can begin screening movies to an outdoor audience from Monday. -Theatres and concert halls Also set to re-open in mid-May are theatres and concert halls. But final numbers for maximum capacity limits at these indoor events has not yet been confirmed once venues reopen. -Museums and galleries Indoor venues will not re-open next week and May  remains the target date set by the government. This includes museums and galleries. Outdoor museums, however, are set to open up to the public. The government has previously said that tests must be met on the Covid picture before moving into the next stage and so these dates remain conditional. All of the below will not re-open next week -Adventure playgrounds and bowling alleys -Amusement arcades, adult gaming centres, bingo halls and casinos -Skating rinks -Entertainment venues such as escape rooms and laser quest -Play areas, including soft play centres and inflatable parks -Model villages "},{"url":null,"title":"leaked details 11m facebook users","story":"NewsLeaked details of m Facebook users found on hacking site - is your number on the list More than million users of the social media site have been affected by a data breach, it has been reported, which the social media giant says dates back to  and has been dealt withmirrorShareCommentsByJonathan ColesReporter:,  APR NewsFacebook said the issue was dealt with in  \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

They said they are aposreasonably confidentapos that Covid will become manageable by that point. In papers released by SAGE the expert group was said to be confident that easing lockdown restrictions would not heap pressure on the NHS, eventhere is a rise in infections, due to the success of the jab rollout. “Any resurgence in hospital admissions and deaths following Step  of the Roadmap alone is highly unlikely to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS,” SAGE said in the minutes of a March  meeting, published on Monday.  But the advisory  is not as optimistic about the later stages of the roadmap. In a stark warning the papers claimed it is aposhighly likely that there will be a further resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths.apos SAGE cited work compiled by the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling , which looked at models made by Imperial College London, Warwick University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. SPI-M said that a new peak could occur in summer or autumn, and that its timing and size would depend on how people behave after restrictions end. “It is highly likely that there will be a further resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths after the later steps of the Roadmap,” SPI-M said.

Officers said they wanted to “thank the local community for their assistance” as a probe was launched. Local dad Paul Price was hailed a “hero” after he used his lorry to prevent the suspect from driving away after he was allegedly seen with a girl.

He said: “I thought I saw the car coming into the scheme and thought I observed somebody jumping in the car. It was possibly a teenager with blonde hair. “About  to  minutes later there were several police cars and a gentleman who was trapped in his car.  “There was a car and a recovery vehicle parked side by side which stopped him exiting the scheme. “The man didn’t seem to want to get out the car and the flatbed truck had its door right next to the door on thedriver’s car. “After that, I saw two policemen take him out the car and they were standing talking to him outside the police car.” On social media, mum Joyce Campbell shared images of the suspect sitting behind the wheel before being led into a waiting police car.

Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Spi-M modelling subgroup of Sage, said some figures suggest Boris Johnsonaposs roadmap, which calls for all restrictions to end as early as June , could be sped up. Still, he and other experts have warned there could be a “resurgence” of Covid- infections as society is unlocked and more social mixing is permitted. Dr Tildesley, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick, said the Government should be cautious after England moves to Step  and reopens places such as non-essential shops, pub beer gardens, hairdressers and beauty salons, libraries and zoos. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. It comes after a paper from experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicinesuggested that lting restrictions in the next stage of the road map “may lead to a small surge of cases and deaths”. Their modelling suggested that stage four in June, when restrictions are expected to be lted completely, could “lead to a larger surge of cases and deaths comparable to that seen during the first wave”. They cautioned their findings were “preliminary” and made “pessimistic assumptions” about the later stages of the road map. And scientists at the University of Warwick also shared a similar conclusion that a “distinct third wave of infection” would arise due to the current rate of planned unlocking, with hospital admissions peaking between late July and mid-August.With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. Minutes from the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesmeeting on March  said there could be resurgences in hospital admissions “of a similar scale to January  after later stages of the road map”. Dr Tildesley warned there may well be a third wave in the UK but probably not as high as some modelling predicts. He told LBC: I was really pleasantly surprised that when schools open we have managed to keep things in check, so I think...these numbers keep going down over the next few weeks there certainly is an argument to say aposwell actually weaposre doing really well with the road map, it could be sped up.apos I would say I would want to be a little bit cautious over the next few weeks as we get beyond this April relaxation to monitor that just to be really sure that cases are continuing to go down.  He added: Now I will say thatthings keep going down at the rate that they are then there certainly is an argument for speeding up the process, but we do know that the later relaxations, particularly the May one when people can stay in each otheraposs homes for the first time for a long period of time, we might expect that could cause a... quite signicant rise in mixing and potentially a rise infections which is why this monitoring is really needed. Dr Tildesley said a third wave of Covid may not have a peak as high as some modelling predicts. He said: I think we do have very high levels of vaccination now, we do need to remember this, we are protecting our vulnerable. But the vaccines are not % protective so when we switch from an R number less than  that we have at the moment, to a lot of mixing later on, we may get a resurgence.  I donapost expect we will have a resurgence of the same scale that we saw in January. So then there needs to be some very serious questions asked. If we do see a rise in cases,we do start to see hospital occupancy go up a little bit, are we going to put in controls or is it something that weaposre just going to try to manage with local testing and so forth  I think thataposs the question the Government are going to potentially have to answer as we get towards the summer. Former chief scientic adviser to the Government, Professor Sir Mark Walport, told BBC Breakfast very good progress was being made on the road map but a third wave was possiblethe brakes are taken off completely. He said: Itaposs clear that weaposre making good progress along the road map, and itaposs entirely appropriate that the first set of restrictions are being relaxed so that makes very good sense indeed. But weaposre a long way from taking the brakes off completely. The vaccine rollout is going incredibly well... weaposve seen deaths fall fairly precipitously... all very good news, but weaposve only got to look across the Channel and see that France currently has over , new cases a day, so the virus is still very much around andwe take all the brakes off, then itaposs quite clear that there is a very substantial risk of a further wave of infection. He said that by June the numbers are going to be really important here. He added: This is driven by data, and itaposs been data not dates throughout, so these are projections.  What the Spi-M modelling has shown is that even with a pretty effective vaccine, itaposs not perfect, not everyone will be vaccinated, and there will still be quite a few people by June who arenapost immune, and that creates the setting for potentially another wave.Itaposs likely to be dferent from the first one because we know that the vaccines are very good at keeping people out of hospital and stopping people dying. And thataposs why itaposs important to really focus on what the data at the time are actually showing. It could take a few years to get back to normal completely, Sir Mark said. Asked how long social distancing and face masks might be part of peopleaposs lives, he said: Weaposve lived with flu for many years, and we are unfortunately going to have to live with coronavirus, but we know that over time it will change its relationship with us in the sense that more humans will be immune."},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Gabriella Christmas was delighted when she found out she was pregnant but at a five-week scan, she discovered a shadow had appeared which was another baby conceived three weeks after. The -year-old stay-at-home mum from Bedfordshire, was shocked her pregnancy was a rare case of superfetation - something that occurs in just .% of women. At the  week scan, Gabriella discovered the second twin, Ezra, was developing three weeks behind older brother, Eduardo, both now two. lbs oz Eduardo and lbs oz Ezra were delivered by C-section in July  and despite being born three weeks early, the younger twin was perfectly healthy. Gabriella said: They are twins because they were born on the same day and have the same genetic parents but it was two separate pregnancies that happened at the same time. It was really hard to get our heads around the fact that Iaposd fallen pregnant while I was already pregnant. They looked dferent when they were born, my little one, Ezra, was a lot smaller so I had to buy clothes for my twins but in dferent sizes and his skin hadnapost gone through the process of being less waxy so he looked like a little old man. There was also adference and there still is.  Iaposm really fortunate that they were both healthy because there were fears Ezra would have to go into NICU because he was premature and his brother wasnapost but he was a healthy, early baby. Gabriella admits that people still donapost believe that the brothers are twins because of their size dference. She said: They still look dferent now and people donapost believe theyaposre twins. They are absolutely twin brothers because they have that bond but they couldnapost be more dferent, theyaposre like chalk and cheese.  Eduardo is really calm and creative and Ezra is boisterous and loves to trash everything. Gabriella discovered that she had was going through two separate pregnancies after a neo natal expert investigated a mysterious shadow in her womb. She said: I went for an early scan at about five weeks because I thought I was losing the baby. I had an internal ultrasound because it as so early.  They said there was a baby and a shadow which could have possible been another baby but they didnapost know for sure because it was a lot smaller. At the -week scan, the doctors were worried because one was so much bigger than the other and they thought that was because the babies were sharing a placenta. We went to a neo natal expert who said there were two placentas and two completely dferent pregnancies. The second baby was three weeks behind in his development because he was three weeks younger so Ezra consistently grew three weeks behind Eduardo during the pregnancies.

The outdoor area initiative was first mooted in June last year, with it recently claried that the same rules will apply this spring. Speaking when the policy was first announced, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said: I know we all look forward to seeing our pubs, cafes and restaurants open their doors again and Iaposm determined to give them a helping hand to get back on their feet and their staff back to work safely. Thataposs why we are introducing changes to make it quicker, easier and cheaper for them to set up outdoor seating and street stalls to serve food and drink.  Kate Nicholls, UKHospitality chief executive, previously hailed the move to allow takeaway pints to be served. This is great news for pubs, she said.

The government said that the Global Travel Taskforce will give an update on travel later this week and will set out well before May  its plans regarding holidays. Currently there is a ban on international travel for Brits as part of lockdown rules and while there are some legally permitted reasons to travel abroad, a holiday isnapost one of them. But, as talks of vaccine passports offering hope for more summer holidays this summer ramp up, here are countries set to accept tourists who have received a jab. While each country have their own specic requirements and travellers should always check with the relevant foreign offices, here are the countries already accepting vaccinated visitors. Estonia The Foreign Office advice for Estonia states: From  February, the -day self-isolation and Covid- testing are not mandatory for iniduals who tested positive for Covid- and declared cured no longer than six months ago or iniduals who have undergone Covid- vaccination less than six months ago. The FCDO says An officially certied print-out from another country’s digital health system will also be accepted, in lieu of proof of having received a vaccination in Estonia. Romania Travellers to Romania who cannot provide proof of vaccination will need to provide proof of a negative Covid- test certicate, taken no more than  hours before entering Romania. Georgia Foreign citizens from a limited number of countries, including the UK, are allowed to enter Georgia by air under some conditions. This includes entry for citizens of any country who have aposdocumentary proofapos of having received a full course of the Covid vaccination. Poland Travellers to Poland are exempt from a ten-day self isolationthey have either had Covid or been vaccinated. Passengers will have to give evidence they have in the last six months aposself-isolated or have been hospitalised in hospital due to testing positiveapos or been fully vaccinated. Lebanon Official travel advice states that vaccinated passengers can avoid having to quarantine. The UK Gov advice says: Diplomats and their families, official delegations and [United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon] officers are exempt from the quarantine measures, as well as those who have received the Covid- vaccination, on the condition that they have proof of vaccination and take a PCR test on arrival as a precautionary measure. Seychelles As of March , Seychelles is open to all visitors irrespective of their vaccination status, excluding travellers from South Africa. Visitors from all other countries will be required to present a negative PCR test taken within  hours prior to departure and must stay at approved accommodation. There is no quarantine requirement and no restriction on movement for visitors upon entry. Iceland From April , all travellers, regardless of origin, are welcome to visit Icelandthey can show either a certicate of full vaccination against Covid- or a certicate of previous Covid- infection.  Croatia Since April , anyone who presents a Covid- vaccine certicatecan enter Croatia. You can also enter with a negative test result taken no more than  hours prior to your arrival in the country. Montenegro Fully vaccinated travellers from any country can enter Montenegro. They must have received their second dose at least seven days before arriving in the country. Alternatively, you can visit with a negative test taken within  hours of travel Belize Belize became first Caribbean country to welcome vaccinated travellers, waiving the requirement for a negative Covid- test. Visitors who can prove they have had both doses of an approved vaccine at least two weeks before entering the country. CyprusThe countryaposs tourism minister previously announced that British tourists who had been fully vaccinated against coronavirus could enter without restrictions from May .Deputy Tourism Minister Savvas Perdios told the semi-official Cyprus News Agency that Brits with the jab would not need a test or have to quarantine. Greece Speaking at a travel conference, the countryaposs Minister of Tourism Harry Theoharis said that the nation would be welcoming back tourists from May , without a need to show proof of a Covid- vaccine to enter. Spain The countryaposs tourism minister Maria Reyes Maroto said Spain wanted to be a pioneer in introducing the immunity passports and confirmed her ministry was pursuing the idea. The minister did not say exactly where or when the pilot scheme would start but some reports suggest it could be by mid-May.  Portugal Rita Marques, Portugalaposs Secretary of State for Tourism, has said that authorities are pushing to reopen borders to UK travellers from May, and that visitors would either need to have received the Covid- vaccine, or be able to show proof of a negative Covid- test taken before travel. Speaking to LBC News, she said that the country could reopen from May or June, depending on the Covid- situation at the time. Israel Israel is currently leading the world when it comes to vaccinations. More than half of its population has received a first dose – higher than any other country in the world. Israel has joined Greece in setting a precedent for a ‘vaccination bubble’, which Cyprus is also hoping to get in on. All arrivals between the countries can dodge quarantine on arrival with proof of immunity. Red list countries Hungary and Slovenia are set to remain as aposred listapos countries for UK travellers. The list of banned nations will reach  when the Philippines, Pakistan, Kenya, and Bangladesh are added from am on April . The ban means most non-UK nationals or residents will be banned completely from entering Englandthey have been in those countries in the last  days. British, Irish and third-country nationals with residence rights will be allowed to enter - but only through hotel quarantine. That means paying £, to be held in isolation for  days in a government-appointed facility. They will have to take two tests, on or before day  and on or after day , as well as a test within  hours of coming to the UK.

Further north the cold climate will drop even further with lows of about minus C, plummeting as far as minus C in remote parts of northern and central Scotland. Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said wintry showers will sweep across Wales, south-west England, and down the east coast during the day.He said: Through the afternoon we might even get a few homegrown showers, so really anywhere [Tuesday] could catch a wintry shower by the time we get to the end of the afternoon. Nobody is entirely immune to the odd bit of sleet or snow. It wonapost last long and it wonapost settle for very long either, but nobody is going to be  per cent safe from not seeing anything. Snow warnings remain in place for northern Scotland until am, with as much as cm falling in higher areas. A separate yellow warning for snow and ice is also in place for west Wales and Northern Ireland also until am, with up to cm expected to fall.  Temperatures are forecast to scrape to highs of just C in the south of England, and between C and C in the north later on on Tuesday. But Mr Partridge said the wind chill will see most of the south feel a couple of degrees above freezing, while in Scotland the temperature will feel around minus C. Tuesday night is forecast to be the coldest this week, with the mercury plummeting to minus C in southern and central England in the early hours of Wednesday morning.  In the north of England and into Scotland, temperatures are expected to hover around minus C to minus C.

Samantha Gibson, , claims she was handcuffed and pushed into the side of a police van for apossaying the f-wordapos. She was held on suspicion of a public order offence after police alleged she swore officers following the arrest of her partner. Dave had been arrested after police mistakenly identied him as a suspect wanted for other matters.During his arrest, a visibly distressed Ms Gibson repeatedly asked officers what was happening. Footage shows the moment Ms Gibson appears to be pushed into the side of a van by an officer.She claims the impact caused the wing mirror to break. She told the Manchester Evening News: I started asking a police officer some questions. Due to my shock I was swearing, but standing still. I was asking what was going on, why could they not take his cuffs off, and occasionally using the f-word mid-sentence. Suddenly, I was jumped on by a number of officers and told I was under arrest. At this point, I went into a PTSD flashback, and then my head was smashed into the van wing-mirror with such force that it was folded back against the van, and I saw bits of black plastic coming off it. I later heard that was glass on the floor below me. I briefly blacked out at this point, my legs gave way, and I wet myself.I had been pushed and pulled between officers who were mostly male and a lot larger than me. I was shouting to police to stop as I have PTSD. I then remember being on the floor shouting for help as officers violently cuffed me, pulled me back up and held me against the van. I was bent over almost double for a while, with their hands pressing my head down.  I went into a severe panic attack and could not stop crying and shaking. After being taken to the police station, Ms Gibson claimed she was given a £ fixed penalty notice, which she said she will be appealing. She added that the incident has put her off protesting in future as she is scared of the police. Ms Gibson, who is from Wrexham but has a support bubble with Wigan resident Dave, said: Iaposve been an environmental activist for a number of years and Iaposve seen a lot of police violence but nothing like the other day.  It was completely out of the blue, neither of us had done anything wrong and Iaposm in shock. I donapost want to be around the police ever again so that rules out protests. It was like the TAUincited a riot. The whole time we were sitting on the bench and the evidence gatherers were pointing their camera at Dave, who was doing nothing, while people were blocking the tram lines in front of us. Daveaposs a pretty calm guy so heaposs been processing things but heaposs quite eager to take it forward as well. Ms Gibson said she is apospretty soreapos following the encounter and reported injuries to her hands, wrists, arms and knees, as well as pain in her shoulders and neck.  She added: As a sufferer of PTSD and panic disorder, I feel extremely traumatised. The hopelessness of having size, gender, and numbers used against me. The smell of aftershave, the sound of shouting, and the sight of large men in hi-viz is making me feel incredibly anxious. I have been going through therapy for the last few months, and this has brought me back to square one. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said Ms Gibson received a caution. They added that Dave was arrested after he refused to engage with officers.

When I tried it was a little heavy so then I brought in the big guns. And youaposll never believe what I found. Tony then films himself running away from the box as he retches and pulls his top to cover his mouth, revealing that what he had dug up was the septic tank for his house.  Although he joked that he did know it was a waste tank when he started digging, he says he had only gone in search of the box after he learned the home was on a septic system more than six years after moving in. He was informed by a plumber who visited to identy why all the pipes had stopped draining. Tony said: We didnapost know we were on septic system. I have lived here for six years, the landlord before me had lived here for two years, and the people before us had a garden bed right over the top of where the septic tank is.

Carl Wallace was woken shortly after am on Easter Saturday - also Mr Wallaceaposs th birthday - to a hooded man smashing his way into his business, Diabloaposs Southwest Grill in Augusta, Georgia. CCTV footage captured at the diner shows a man in a hooded tracksuit using a brick to smash the restaurantaposs front window, before forcibly removing the cash register and shaking it to discover there was nothing in there. Within  seconds, he was back out the front door… no money was taken, Mr Wallace said. Whilst his first reaction was anger and frustration, Mr Wallace found it in his heart to take a dferent approach in light of the Easter holiday. Really frustration and damage was the only thing done… we get woken up in the middle of the night, you have to run into the store, clean up the big mess and scramble to get the store back open by  o’clock. It made me realise, as a robber, this guy’s really not doing a good job – there’s got to be other career paths for this guy. He shared the video on Facebook with his number, where he asked the criminal to swing by for a job application.It has since racked up thousands of views, and also caught the attention of local business owners who said they too had CCTV footage of a man, who they believe to be the same person, breaking into their property. Mr Wallace is extremely hopeful that the man will be in touch so he can help to break the cycle of the burglaraposs actions.  That would be one of the greatest stories… you take somebody that was on the wrong path, someone gives them a hand, said Mr Wallace. Maybe this guy’s never been given that opportunity. Maybe he’s always been put down in le. Mr Wallace added: Your first reaction is anger and frustration, then you think about Easter weekend and think, what’s a better response  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/20092567-1-e1617481436170-940x564.jpg ","title":"analysis dundee st johnstone scottish cup james mcpake","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWith top-flight St Johnstone coming to town not many would have been betting on Championship Dundee for Scottish Cup progress.Guy Melamed#s strike on  minutes meant the Perth men made for a wise punt but, for those with an emotional stake in the Dee, the progression displayed on the pitch will have pleased them nonetheless.The Dark Blues put in a terric performance against top-six Saints, a dominant display from start to finish.Albeit Callum Davidson#s side had an off day and still managed to win through, it truly was an impressive showing from a Dundee team that has struggled at both ends of the park at dferent times this season.Boss James McPake was rightly proud of his players for their efforts in trying to break down a stubborn visiting defence in what was a fiery and intense contest.On another day, they would#ve, more than once. In fact, on Saturday, Dundee probably should#ve found a way past Zander Clark at Dens Park.From Paul McMullan#s thunderous strike from distance crashing off the bar, to Danny Mullen#s disallowed goal early in the second half and, most of all, Clark#s penalty save from Charlie Adam with  minutes to go.Dundee had their opportunities.Saints limited them to efforts from distance in the first period but the second half saw the hosts really assert their authority.Unable to even force extra time felt like a harsh outcome for McPake#s men but the Dee gaffer was happy with the spirit shown, regardless.“I thought my players were excellent to a man and gave everything for the football club,# he said.“They left nothing out there and are very unlucky not to be in the next round of the cup.“It’s disappointing in that respect, because we wanted to go through, but credit to Callum and St Johnstone they are in the hat for the next round.“I’m proud of my players.“I don’t think we were unlucky. I won’t use that.“I think we were the better team. We had to capitalise when we were on top and we didn’t.“You can put that down to good defending – they have shown that all season and you have to give them credit.“As much as we were the team on top and chasing the game, they held strong.“We missed the penalty but I think that’s down to a good save. He gets a hand to it and he keeps it.“Charlie strikes the ball very well whenever he strikes it.“McMullan had a shot that hits the bar and I can’t really remember them troubling us other than the goal.”He continued: “It sounds like sour grapes when I say the better team lost it but I am here to give my honest views about what I saw out there and I will stand by that.“I will watch it back but I don’t think I will change my views. I have before but I don’t think I will this time.“I am very proud of my players, the way they handled going behind against a Premiership team who have won a cup and going for a European place.“I have been asked all week: #Is it about seeing where you#re at ##No, it was about progressing in the cup and we are bitterly disappointed we’ve not.”Of course, the assumption is Dundee will use such a strong performance against Premiership opposition to kick on with their push for promotion to the top table.Securing a play-off berth, preferably second spot, is crucial for a club set up for top-flight football.For McPake, though, as much as the focus turns to two huge second-tier tussles with Ayr United tomorrow and Morton at the weekend, his mind is still haunted by what could#ve been.It#s a huge week for the club but he insists their cup exit does sting as he dissected Mullen#s disallowed goal.The striker, who stabbed home inside the box after Saints keeper Clark spilled Jordan Marshall#s cross, was adjudged offside by the far side linesman.McPake was booked by referee Craig Napier for his protestations and continued to contest the call post-match.“I’ve seen it from three dferent angles and I’ve not changed my mind,# he argued.“He has guessed, in my opinion. Credit to himhe’s got it right – what a callhe has.“How he can see that, from the three angles I’ve seen, Danny is offside – I’m not sure.“Initially they gave the free-kick for a foul on the goalkeeper and quickly changed their mind to offside.“I’m told it’s a dferent signal with the flag when someone is offside to when it’s a foul.“Maybe my booking was right – you can get booked for anything nowadays.“You show any sort of emotion and the linesman was quick to tell the referee to come and caution the coach.“I’m not surethat’s right but that’s part of football now and I need to learn that and maybe not show emotion, which would make football worse, in my opinion.“It’s not why we lost the football game, we lost because St Johnstone scored and we couldn’t.“In my opinion, we scored a perfectly good goal.“We missed a penalty – it was a good save from Zander Clark, Charlie was unlucky.“At a time when you’re on top, it is really crucial you get a goal and, in my opinion, we got a perfectly good goal chopped off.“If it is an honest mistake, I can accept, but what I can’t accept is people guessing.“There are people in there, late on in their careers wanting a cup run, there are young coaches on our bench and on Callum’s bench so it shouldn’t be down to people just guessing.“You have to be % right. Listen, it might show he is right but, from seeing it in real time, it’s a guess.#At times this season McPake has cut a defeated figure, desperate almost, but it#s good to hear him sounding fired up.Hopefully, that transmits to his team and they use the disappointment of a cup exit as fuel to get back to mixing it with the big boys on a regular basis.I certainly won#t be betting against them.JIM SPENCE: Mark Ogren is planning a golf course # but a shared stadium for Dundee United and Dundee would be a real hole in one\" title\"#JIM SPENCE: Mark Ogren is planning a golf course # but a shared stadium for Dundee United and Dundee would be a real hole in one# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp opinion jim-spence  jim-spence-mark-ogren-golf-shared-stadium-dundee-united-dundee embed # secretmmOIBTFzm\" data-secret\"mmOIBTFzm\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/11/20010666_37021484-e1606041413768-940x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc liam fontaine scottish premiership ayr united","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remLiam Fontaine has urged his Dundee team-mates to put in the #hard graft# as they look to gain promotion to the Premiership.The Dark Blues travel to Ayr tomorrow night and welcome Morton to Dens Park on Saturday in what is a huge week for the club#s Championship campaign.Centre-half Fontaine has called it #the business end of the season# as they head into the final six games before the play-offs.With Hearts running away with the title, the Dee are aiming for second spot to give themselves the best chance of beating top-flight opposition in the post-season.Despite the - defeat, Fontaine insists Dundee can take heart from their Scottish Cup performance at home to St Johnstone on Saturday.He believes it shows they can compete with top-tier opposition on their day as they look to end the season strong.“When we’ve played against Premiership teams, even when we played Hibs earlier in the season , I think we’ve given them good games,# the -year-old said.“We’ve got to do the hard graft in the league we’re in at the moment.“We’ve got to put performances in like that week in, week out and be consistent.“We keep saying it but we have to keep our performances up there each game so we’ll recover now for a big game tomorrow.“The motivation is always there to get to the top league, whatever country you play in.“We’re in a good position at the moment, we’ve just got to win our games and, hopefully, we can secure a play-off spot and push on from there.”Currently sitting in third spot in the second-tier standings, three points behind Raith Rovers, Fontaine knows the importance of the Dee#s run-in.He believes they have enough quality in the squad to achieve their goals and is happy to have linked up at Dens Park # looking to secure a third Championship promotion of his career.The former Hibs and Ross County man continued: “It’s the business end of the season, we’re in a good position and,we can perform consistently like that and bring that work-rate and creativity, we’ll be well placed.“When I was out of contract I had a few options but I wanted to go somewhere that, one, it was a good club, two, there was a squad being built there and, three, the manager.“We’ve got a good squad here, young players with good energy and I think from Saturday you can see they can cause anyone problems.“St Johnstone are a very, very good team at keeping people out and, yeah, we didn’t score on Saturday but the chances were there and on another day we score goals and progress.”As for their cup exit at the hands of Callum Davidson#s Perth men, thanks to a goal from Guy Melamed, Fontaine felt a little hard done by.The Dark Blues competed well with the top-six, Betfred Cup-winning Saints, particularly in the second half.Danny Mullen saw a goal chalked off for offside, though there was some confusion with some believing it was ruled out for a foul on away goalkeeper Zander Clark.Clark then gave away a penalty as he clattered Mullen inside the area. However, the Saints stopper made amends, stooping low to this left to deny Charlie Adam from  yards.Fontaine believes on another day those moments would have gone Dundee#s way in a match they dominated.“I thought it was a good cup tie and we left everything out there,# he added.“On another day we progress. We created quite a few chances andthe penalty goes in or the goal is given that was chalked off we’re in the next round.“Apart from that, it was a positive performance from our point of view.“Penalty stops happen and the goalie made a good save.“It’s more the time it took before the goal was chalked off.“There wasn’t really a certain decision. It’s disappointing but we didn’t let it effect us.“We kept going and went for it and, like I said, on another day we at least go to extra time.”JIM SPENCE: Mark Ogren is planning a golf course # but a shared stadium for Dundee United and Dundee would be a real hole in one\" title\"#JIM SPENCE: Mark Ogren is planning a golf course # but a shared stadium for Dundee United and Dundee would be a real hole in one# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp opinion jim-spence  jim-spence-mark-ogren-golf-shared-stadium-dundee-united-dundee embed # secretnxoLndFQk\" data-secret\"nxoLndFQk\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.57224774-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.57224774-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.57224774-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.57224774-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"gym worker in dundee sees poetry work popularity soar during lockdown","story":"A city gym worker who has spent lockdown fine tuning her poetry writing has been earning rave reviews for her works over the past  months.

Laverty has promised global fans the mic won’t be completely dropped now the easing of lockdown has allowed him to pick the scissors back up.During the pandemic, Arbroath’s Danny has raised a remarkable £, to fund equipment for NHS Tayside.The popular performer staged weekly Facebook Live concerts which were enjoyed by thousands across the world, many of them ex-pat Red Lichties looking to keep in touch with home.With friends Alan and Val Mowatt staging Friday night Live Fae Oor Living Room shows and Danny taking to Facebook on Saturday evenings, fans at home and abroad had plenty to look forward to each week.But -year-old Danny feels the importance of customers being allowed back through salon doors cannot be understated.They might even be lucky enough to get an impromptu song from Danny at the piano in his Keptie Street premises.What he feels is key, however, is being able to talk so someone again.“I didn’t realise until all this happened just how important our job is,” he said.“People joked about being here for their hour’s therapy and in general they are always desperate to talk.“But after the year everyone has had it is more important to them than ever.“They have someone independent to chat to and it is so important to their mental wellbeing because it has been unbelievably tough for everyone,” he said.Danny has been thrilled by the reaction to his Facebook shows and the benefit it has brought.“This all started really early in the first lockdown when I was painting the salon in my old togs one night,” he said.“It was something to keep me busy because so I thought do a few songs and it all just went from there.“The response has been amazing.”Grateful fans have sent donations to fund vital pieces of equipment for Tayside hospitals with the £, total.“The amount of cards and messages we have had from people saying how much it has helped them get through this is just fantastic,” added Danny.“I think that’s a major positive of this whole situation.“People have been making connections with each other, evenit’s just online, and realising just how important it is to talk about things which may be getting to you.“If you’ve got a niggle in your knee, you are quick enough to go to the doctor and get it checked because you know it might get worse.“We need people to get their mental wellness checked out just as quickly and I think people are realising more how important it is.”He added: “It will be full on for us now we are back but I’m not doing the hours I did the last time lockdown was lted.“We were starting at five in the morning and going on into the night, but I just can’t do that again.“The clients are there, they are coming back to us and they have said they are willing to wait.“We’ll keep singing, but just on the first Saturday of every month and I hope folk will still enjoy that.”Danny’s lockdown performances also included one from the Angus town’s Webster Theatre.It was organised by Angus Alive to give Danny the full stage to perform on # albeit without an audience – a few months into lockdown.The Mowatts enjoyed a similarly enthusiastic worldwide response to their music – paused by a dramatic heart attack scare for Alan.He took unwell during a July performance, but the -year-old sang on after a quick break and a glass of water.A trip to hospital revealed he had suffered a heart attack and Alan underwent a triple bypass.He and Val were back at the microphone before the end of the year and have continued to keep their Facebook audience entertained since then.Newsletter Get top stories

nationwide boom in cycling, with new figures revealing a steady increase in cyclists throughout the past year.National organisation Cycling Scotland compiled the stats using  automatic counters placed on popular paths across the country.On March  this year, more than , cyclists were clocked riding past them – marking a % rise on when the same study was carried out last March.In one area, the number of cyclists increased by almost fivefold.The organisation has hailed the figures as one of the few “bright spots” during a “horrendous” year, but is calling for more investment in infrastructure.When comparing the first months of lockdown with , Cycling Scotland found a % increase in numbers during April.There were hikes of % in May, % in June, % in July and % in August, compared to their respective months the year before.The only period in the -month stretch with a decrease was January , when numbers fell by % year-on-year, likely due to bad weather.Of all the counters used in the study, the largest boom in biking was seen in Dunfermline – up %.In the north of the country, only four paths in Lerwick were monitored.However, During February, Aberdeen City Council conducted its own active travel study, compiling -hour daily averages of cyclists at ious locations.It found the number of bikers on Beach Esplanade, the Deeside Way at Peterculter, Parkway and Seaton Park were at their highest for three years.Overall, however, there were % fewer cyclists in the city compared to February .Cycling Scotland chief executive Keith Irving said: “It has been a horrendous year, but one of the few bright spots has been more people getting back on their bikes.“Cycling has a key role to play in people getting exercise and fresh air, managing the ongoing pressure on our transport system and, crucially, tackling the global climate emergency we face.“We’re delighted by the massive increase in cycling and it’s vital we see it continue and expand.”For as little as £. a month you

they plan to support Aberdeen following the news the city may lose its last department store.Last week the north-east was rocked by the news John Lewis plans to close its store in Aberdeen – the only remaining department store in the north of Scotland.The retailer’s plans to close its branch on George Street provoked a huge public backlash, with more than , people signing petitions and hundreds more writing letters asking the chain to reconsider.A taskforce, including local authority chiefs and business leaders, was set up in a bid to convince John Lewis to rethink its decision.The closure of the store could lead to the loss of around  jobs – the latest in a long line of blows for the local economy.City leaders fear a #domino effect# where the loss of the store has an impact on other businesses in Aberdeen and the north-east, prompting calls for government support.The council#s administration has written to the leader of each main political party urging them to support the campaign.We asked the leaders what they will do to support the citythey form the next Scottish Government following May#s election.Here is what they said.#Throughout the pandemic, our retail sector has taken a massive hit and this is reflected by the unfortunate and incredibly sad decision that John Lewis took to close its doors in Aberdeen # a decision I hope it is willing to reconsider.#As we recover from the pandemic and out of lockdown, businesses need to be at the heart of that and a re-elected SNP Government would stand ready to work with the Aberdeen taskforce and all parties in the city to ensure Aberdeen City Centre is vibrant and attractive.“The SNP in government have already backed business in the city with more than £m of support during the pandemic.#Re-electing an SNP Government will ensure Aberdeen City receives a raft of measures to regenerate the area, including access to the £m City Centre Recovery Fund and the £m town centre fund, as well as £m set aside in this year#s budget specically to help support and create jobs in Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire.#An SNP government stands ready to support Aberdeen, to revitalise the city centre, and to support investment where it is needed.##I’d like to thank everybody involved with the taskforce for working together to try and keep John Lewis in Aberdeen.#News of the planned closure was greeted with dismay across the North East, and I know this must be a really dficult time for the  members of staff.#I hope that a solution can be found that will allow John Lewis to maintain a presence in the city.#The Covid pandemic and its accompanying restrictions have accelerated problems that already existed for retail and our town centres.#Aberdeen has also been hit worse than most, with a collapse in oil prices and a business rates system that takes far more than it gives.#The truth is that the SNP government hasn’t given the region the attention it deserves.#That#s why I launched a campaign last week for a fair share for the north-east, including a £ billion regional enterprise agency, upgrades to key infrastructure, and rolling out broadband far faster than the SNP.#“Our high streets have been decimated through the pandemic and the loss of John Lewis is a terrible blow for Aberdeen city centre, its employees and customers.“Scottish Labour is a pro-business party and is committed to launching a Business Network to establish solid relations with employers across the country.“City centre businesses will be vital in rebuilding our economy. We will focus on jobs and retail to help kick start our post-pandemic recovery, and ensure our high streets thrive once more.”Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: #The closure of John Lewis leaves a major hole in the middle of Aberdeen. We are determined to build a strong and flourishing economy in the North East so that we can sustain international brands like John Lewis in the city.“In the recent Scottish budget the Scottish Liberal Democrats secured £m for transition training specically for the North East boost the economy and new industries.#Under Scottish Liberal Democrat proposals, we will reform business rates to take the burden off high street retailers and give those shops the ability to compete with online retailers.#We will also give local authorities more powers to get to reshape their city and town centres into vibrant and flourishing places that people want to visit, spend money and set up shop.#“The John Lewis closure is devastating news for the workers and it shows how we really need to rethink our high streets after the pandemic, to make them more resilient and focused on the communities that live in and rely on them.#If we want our town centres to thrive, we need attractive public urban spaces that people want to spend time in.#This means levelling the playing field for independent shops, cooperatives like John Lewis and for community spaces, and stop giving tax-dodging online retailers incentives and tax breaks.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59025669-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59025669-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59025669-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59025669-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"north east professor calls for radical rethink of aberdeen city centre","story":"A north-east professor has called for a “radical” revamp of Aberdeen’s city centre following the news the region’s last department store is to close.

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began.After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

then Lee Westwood is likely to be wearing the Green Jacket at Augusta on Sunday.The man from Worksop, a Ryder Cup hero for Europe on so many occasions, will be a fitting Masters champion for some north-east professionals after suffering decades of near misses.Kemnay pro Simon Hansen said: “I’m going with my heart and picking Lee Westwood.“He has been playing some great, consistent golf over the last couple of months and his previous record at The Masters is really good .“Lee deserves a Major and has a really good chance this week.”Peterculter’s Gary Lister has avoided giving Westwood his full backing in the hope he comes good.Gary said: “For someone who has backed Lee Westwood all his days – thankfully each-way – I’m going to give him a chance this week as I’m generally a jinx.“Lee is in the form of his le and I’d dearly like to see him get the monkey off his back on Sunday.“But I’ll give him a chance and plump for another Englishman, Tommy Fleetwood, who looks a good bet at the odds of -.“Louis Oosthuizen might be good each-way value too at -.”Deeside head pro Ross McConnachie said: “I’d go for Bernhard Langer, because he has about as much chance as anyone  I have picked to win in the past!“Seriously, though, my money will be on Jon Rahm.“The Spaniard has a great record round Augusta and looks more comfortable with his new equipment.“It’s his time to become a Major champion.”Portlethen’s David Pocock agrees.“Jon Rahm showed some excellent form at the WGC Matchplay a couple of weeks ago and I have a feeling he will win a Major soon,” said David.“Why not this week ”Aboyne director of golf Mike Kinloch believes Dustin Johnson can follow up his win just before Christmas.Mike said: “With this year’s Masters taking place less than five months after the  tournament, I’m backing Dustin to repeat his success.“In the top  on tour for driving distance, DJ has worked hard on his distance control and wedge game to become the best player in the world.“With an emphatic win and good memories of his last appearance at Augusta, he will be the man to beat.“For an outside bet, I’m hoping Scotland’s Bob MacIntyre can put on a good show on his Masters debut.“After a few good weeks in America, I have high hopes for a top- finish.”Murcar Links head pro Gary Forbes tipped Johnson to win back in December, but has switched his allegiance this time around.“It will all come

Masters this week.“Justin has improved his position over the last five years with a best finish of fourth last year.” said Lee, who thinks Thomas has moved past cloud of controversy which descended on him earlier this year.Thomas came under fire for using a homophobic slur after missing a putt at the Sentry Tournament of Champions in Hawaii in January and then lost his grandfather a few weeks later.Lee said: “He has shown his class and nerve by bouncing back with a great win at the Players Championship beating Lee Westwood by a shot.“The tee shots which Justin hit at the th and th holes at Sawgrass – slinging draws – will suit a number of right to left doglegs at Augusta perfectly.“Lee Westwood and Paul Casey perform well at Augusta. They are in their s, but are again proving they can still compete with the best.“Both can finish in the top .”Lee’s brother Dean, the Banchory director of golf operations, believes a young gun from Down Under can cause a surprise.Dean said: “Trying to pick a winner from such a talented field is nearly impossible.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence. That’s an unnecessary distraction.We need a needle-sharp focus on the recovery without the distraction of another isive referendum.Put recovery first.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the Argyll and Bute LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary election"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues. What hypocrites.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,This Mother’s Day, school feeding charity Mary’s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary’s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world’s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary’s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That’s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary’s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother’s Day.

Thanks to the amazing commitment of some truly dedicated people working in the NHS and in social care, lives have been saved and people have been cared for. Stroke teams up and down the country have in many areas managed to continue to offer specialist care and treatment to patients throughout the pandemic. We cannot thank them enough.But the fallout from Covid- is going to pose challenges for everyone in health and social care. Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May’s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented.Colin Oliver, public affairs officer, the Stroke Association in Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"argylls abigail releases debut single","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Keith also co-wrote and produced the single at his studio on the Isle of Lewis.Abigail said: #The single is about encouraging women to follow their passions and carve out a le that they can enjoy and be proud of.#The music video that we created doesn’t have me in it, I wanted it to showcase powerful women who are following their dreams in whatever field their passions and talents lie.#The ambition behind the single is for it to be inspiring and help others to find the courage and drive to fight for their goals, no matter what those are.#I have always recorded with my band Heron Valley, who are a traditional folk band, so recording something for myself has been really dferent. Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin. Her unique music style and honest song writing make Abigail an exciting prospect for the Scottish music scene and Lady a much-anticipated release.Lady will be available to download and stream from Friday March ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks renaissance ruins and ancient rock art","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In  my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died. Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today. If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le.

It has lain at the Rocky Burn area ever since.The vessel caused a row between the Town Council and the firm who owned it, George Hood and Company of Helensburgh.At a meeting last September, it was suggested that the firm be charged dues.Councillor Harry Moffat was quoted as saying: #If people are allowed to dump boats in the loch, I can go and dump a car and nobody can do anything about it.#The council discussed the question of taking legal action against the firm. A considerable number of people have since remarked on the unsightliness of the vessel, which has started to rust.Fishermen ing from the grounds were using the Empire Ace as a mooring stage while they cleaned and washed their catches.But a spokesman for the Helensburgh firm said that it had sold the vessel some months ago. The spokesman refused to reveal the identity of the buyers, but after inquiries, we ascertained that it was purchased by McFadyen’s, the local contracting firm.A spokesman for Archibald McFadyen and Sons said that the Empire Ace was purchased by the firm about two weeks ago.He added that breaking up work was to start on the vessel #within the next few days#.Tobacco firm expands furtherThe well-known Campbeltown firm of Richard Daniels Ltd, tobacco wholesalers and distributors, has opened a depot in Peebles, to meet an increased demand from customers on the east coast.The firm, whose custom stretches from Aberdeen to Middlesborough in England, has just been awarded a #very large# contract from a brewing firm to supply its retail outlet # public houses.Askedthe Peebles opening would create redundancies locally, Mr James Daniels told the Courier that staff in Campbeltown would be unaffected.#It is merely a new phase being added to the business,# he said.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCastlehill Church Sunday SchoolThe children of the Kinloch Church Sunday School had a highly enjoyable social evening on Friday last.

I care about mankind in general and the plight of its citizens, particularly where there is a prevalence of political ineptitude affecting their lives.To reiterate, the EU purchasing system regarding vaccines was and still is chaotic, with the bureaucratic executive in Brussels initially lashing out, and currently certain members within the group are endeavouring to purchase supplies of vaccines for their citizens.In addition, we now have a ban by some countries of vaccine exports from EU manufacturers to non-EU countries. An action which has angered the World Health Organization and upset Australia and other countries.Regarding the comment that the vaccine success is an illusion, perhaps the perusal of some scientic pronouncements in relation to the efficacy would be appropriate.To accuse me of crowing is not only resented but additionally hurtful. I have an extended family in France.My daughter is married to a now retired French army captain and she is an environmental scientist and director of a laboratory in the IRD , a French public research institution. While her mother-in-law has had her first vaccination and in the last week so has her husband, she does not know when she will get an appointment.Currently, in certain areas of France, the virus is very active and part of her remit involves travel to some of these hot-spots when working from home is not practicable. A situation which is very concerning to me.I also do not know when I will be permitted to see them, either in France or in Scotland.Crowing, indeed, I think not.Amidst the miscellany of economic disaster claims awaiting an independent Scotland thrown up by Michael McGeachy in last week#s Courier, I am gratied that Mr McGeachy does, at the very least, accept that Scotland has no debt at the point of independence. This is progress.Unfortunately, Mr McGeachy then goes on to hold up Scotland#s putative deficit as an ace card in the unionist case to #prove# that Scotland is an economic basket-case surviving on English largesse. In reality, it demonstrates the opposite.Scotland#s #deficit#, created within the UK, with our overall budget set by another government # that#s  per cent of Scotland#s revenues and  per cent of our spending # is a damning indictment of Westminster#s reckless economic vandalism. It is the cost of Westminster Tory rule and the union#s failure.Indeed,being part of the UK was such an advantage, Scotland would have a stronger economy than our northern independent competitors.That they are all considerably more successful, with fewer economic resources than Scotland, makes the case for Scotland to have control of all the sovereign economic levers required to succeed in the global economy.Mr McGeachy concludes with the familiar splenetic, #you had your referendum# in . In this time we have had three Prime Ministers, two Westminster elections and one Holyrood election, not forgetting England#s Brexit imposed upon Scotland.Democracy is not pick and mix, Mr McGeachy.

If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I#m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk March"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 19 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The first time that a second ballot was required, all with an amazing  per cent support of the community members who voted and the many organisations and iniduals who gave their time, effort and financial support to achieve this unprecedented result.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOWee Toon workers# nightmareThe Campbeltown area is one of the hardest places in Scotland to find a job.Analysts at Durham University using government figures have calculated that there are . people chasing every job vacancy in the Campbeltown Travel to Work Area.The figures for the three months up to January were . people chasing each vacancy.The February figures put Campbeltown and surrounding area at the top of the league table in Scotland for numbers of unemployed per vacancy.Islay and Mid Argyll were seventh in the table with . people chasing each job while Oban was st with ..Bottom of the table, the easiest place to find work, was the Aberdeen area.Since Durham University prepared its figures, Campbeltown has suffered two major jobs losses.Mull of Kintyre Seafood is expected to close next month with the loss of  jobs and last month Campbeltown Shipyard laid off  men, about one-third of its workforce.FIFTY YEARS AGOFishermen backed to the hiltCampbeltown Town Council is to urge the government to take #every possible step# to protect Scottish fishermen#s interestsBritain enters the Common Market.A resolution submitted by Mr AIB Stewart, secretary of the Clyde Fishermen#s Association, was unanimously accepted at a meeting of the council and representatives from the fishing industry.Fishermen stand to lose the protection of a -mile fishing limitthe country joins the Common Market.Mr Stewart said, with a trace of witty sarcasm: #Of course, inwe could fish in the Mediterranean.#He then referred to the large quantity of herring which was bought in Scotland by other countries, whose once huge fishings have finished.#They have over-fished their own grounds. Three-quarters of the herring landed in Britain are caught between the Clyde and the Minches,# he revealed.If the limit was abolished, Mr Stewart went on, foreigners would not send carrier boats, but ships to catch fish.He concluded by wondering what would happen to communities like Campbeltown, Carradale and Tarbert and places all around.Mr William McAffer, of Tarbert, said his main fear was unemployment.#If we lose the limit, we will lose our identity,# he said.And Councillor Henry Moffat warned: #We#re going to finish up with plenty of empty boats and more men on the dole. People#s livelihood is at stake now.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOThe Poor RollA considerable number of applications for poor relief were disposed of, and the roll of outdoor poor was revised, several alterations in the payments made to iniduals being sanctioned.Bailie Campbell, in connection with the usage where by children in receipt of Parish Council assistance are struck off the roll on attaining the age of  years, suggested that the rule should not be rigidly enforced, but that allowances should be continued as long as children remained in school.Such a concession might be a help to bright pupils, and in the case of others it would keep them off the streets and out of harm till such time as they secured employment.Mr M#Arthur thought it was a waste of time keeping children in school after .Pupils of exceptional educational promise might be helped on the recommendations of responsible authorities, but as for the others the best service that could be done them would be to assist in securing employment for them, and particularly with regard to girls, getting them into domestic service.Temperance reportRev Mr MacLeod, as convenor of the Temperance Committee, submitted his annual report on temperance.He said it had been hoped that the report this year would be of exceptional interest, but the No-Licence Poll taken last November showed that they had still a long way to go before they reached the goal of their desires.There was little cause for elation in the present situation, but still there was no reason to be discouraged.The failure of the efforts on behalf of No-Licence last November was due to the apathy of Christian men and women and to their indference to the terrible effects of the drink traffic.They congratulated their Arran brethren on the magnicent fight they had put up and the splendid result achieved.Shiskine had been the prime factor in the struggle, and there great things had been done but in the north end good work had also been achieved, against odds.Mr MacLeod emphasised the need for no slackening of effort in bringing home to the minds and consciences of the people their duty in relation to the drink traffic, and advised especially the education of the young with regard to this matter.There was plenty of room for increased effort in these directions in all congregations of the Presbytery.Mr MacLeod was thanked for his report."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday march 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs, issued in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tonnes of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m confirmed by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast track decision making.In the s and s boys were often recruited from the town and district by shipping companies.

With Tommy#s family#s kind permission, the Courier shares his story again.Campbeltown#s Tommy Kelly could have no idea he was playing before a future football icon when invited to England for professional trials in .Tommy, something of a football legend in his native Kintyre after a prominent role with Campbeltown Pupils, was known as #Iron Man# for his fearsome playing style and boundless energy.After shining in the local leagues, he was invited to Hartlepool United, a club starting season   in English football#s fourth tier, and managed by Brian Clough # all thanks to an unlikely talent spotter.Tommy said: #As far as I know it was a tanker driver working down here who told Hartlepool about me.#The next thing I had a letter through the door inviting me to a trial.#Clough ran the rule over Tommy, who played mostly as an outside right, who was then in his early s and starting out on an eventual -year career in Campbeltown with the gas board.The young Clough, in his first management job after a prolic career was cut short by injury, greeted Tommy by saying: #I hope the heather#s not growing out of your ears.#Tommy said: #That threw me a bit. I wondered who this arrogant young manager was.#I can still see him now. Although he was just starting out in management, he had total respect among the players. All you heard was #boss, boss, boss# when they addressed him.#Tommy played at outside right against a local side and scored two goals. Clough was so impressed he wanted the #Iron Man# back down for two more trial matches, and Tommy, having loved the atmosphere, was keen to .He said: #The crowd at the Victoria Ground was brilliant and it was a great feeling scoring two goals.#However, the second trip did not turn out quite as planned.Tommy laughed: #Hartlepool paid expenses for my trips but it was hardly enough to get me to Peninver.#I ed and brought the late Mike McGougan, a classy winger for the Pupils, down with me. I phoned Mr Clough beforehand and he was ok with it.#So when we arrived, I met Clough and introduced him to Mike.#Clough said: #Why don#t you bring the whole f****** pipe band down ##We were a bit shocked and Mike got annoyed and spoke back to him. He never played while we were down there.#I spent three weeks at Hartlepool between the two trips, but Clough would only sign me as an amateur. He and his assistant Peter Taylor, who was an absolute gentleman, were on a tight budget.#By that time, I had a family to think about, so it just didn#t work out. I told him it was professional or nothing.#I was just a hard player with a great engine, and the odd goal in me.

The festival is one of Scotland#s friendliest festivals with friends meeting up, milling around our many stalls and enjoying a drink in the sun while listening to live music, not to mention sampling some of the best seafood in the country.#This atmosphere is not something we could compromise for , but the  Tarbert Seafood Festival will certainly be an event worth waiting for.#He added: #We very much look forward to meeting friends, old and new, in September for this year#s music festival. It will be good for Tarbert to get back to doing what it does best # entertaining.#Next year#s Tarbert Seafood Festival is due to be held over the weekend of July  and  .ISLAY:A new rum distillery is rising from the ashes of a former lemonade factory and depot on Islay.The former Hastie#s Lemonade Factory and Dunn#s Depot at Port Ellen closed in June  but has been transformed after standing vacant for years.Islay Spirits, a subsidiary of the Vintage Malt Whisky Company, has entered into a joint venture with Islay start-up company the High Road Rum Company run by Ben Inglis.Under the plan, Mr Inglis would run the business having developed his own unique rum recipe and is a keen student of rum production.Andrew Crook, managing director of the Vintage Malt Whisky Company, said: #Islay is the spiritual home of our company and we owe our success in a large part to the land and its people.#We now have an opportunity to put some investment back into the island and we hope  the community will enjoy seeing a business emerge and hopefully develop over the years.#Planning permission for the refurbishment was granted in January  and has been undertaken by a new building company run by Scott Hastie # grandson and great nephew of the factory#s original owners.Work is nearly completed with the site transformed from #near dereliction# to a great modern workspace, said the Vintage Malt Whisky Company, which praised the construction team and tradesmen for their work.Mr Crook added: #We still have a long journey ahead but we are delighted to be working with Ben and Scott and very encouraged by all the informal support and help we and they have had along the way.#The project will initially be funded by Vintage Malt which will also provide back office and sales and marketing support."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane april 2 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Before the end of the service, the church roof collapsed in what would have been a tragedy, however, all the congregation, being outside, were unharmed.The site is also home to the Clan MacDonald of Largie family crypt. Inside the locked mausoleum, above which the words #Here rest the bones of the House of Largie# are inscribed, are the carved grave slabs of several members of the MacDonald family, including founder Ranald Bane MacDonald, a th century warrior.The stones, featuring Celtic patterns, animals, swords and ships among other things, are said to be some of the best preserved examples in Scotland.Nature has taken hold in many areas of the graveyard but the Killean and Kilchenzie Churches Preservation Association, established in , is working to preserve the buildings that remain from further ruin.According to the charity#s Facebook page, its main aims are: to preserve and make safe the historic churches and the carved stones of Killean and Kilchenzie, by approved conservation techniques, so that these items are available for view and for study by future generations to advance education and encourage interest in the architecture, social and religious history embedded in the sites of the churches, carved stones, and the historical heritage they represent and to preserve and restore the surrounding graveyards so that the headstones are secured and their data recorded so that the genealogical records are preserved."},{"url":null,"title":"easter egg competitions cracking entries","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In - the figure was closer to ,.It is said that damaged ied from #localised root pulling# to heavy grazing of root crops and pasture.Geese were also blamed for creating large puddles.The report suggests that one reason for geese becoming an increasing problem was the fact that they were being attracted by improved grazing work done by the farmers.The president of the Kintyre branch of the NFUS, Rory Collville, said the survey backed the case for a compensation scheme.The branch is due to discuss the survey next month.He told the Courier: #Two-and-a-half-thousand birds may not sound like much.#Butyou were a farmer with that number in your field you#d want compensation for the damage they cause. Where they are a problem, they are a serious problem.#Lighthouse keepers leaveThe last keepers will leave the Mull of Kintyre lighthouse this weekend when the lighthouse is officially automated.The lighthouse, which has shone out over the North Channel since , will be de-manned on Sunday.It has taken two years# work to automate the lighthouse.

We were blown away by the talent of the young people and it was hard to choose the winners.#Fellow judges were Finlay MacDonald, director of piping at the National Piping Centre, and composer, broadcaster and musician Gary Innes.The event was played out over three nights last week on the Pipe Bands for Pupils Facebook page, attracting thousands of viewers, who also got a chance to vote for their favourite band.The championships are run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust which has supported piping and drumming in  local education authority areas with thousands of pupils getting lessons each week.The trust helps expand piping and drumming in Scotland#s state schools with cash grants for tuition.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le.

But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight-loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we#re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares.We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.The Covid crisis has given all of us a sense of uncertainty and vulnerability, of what it#s like to depend more on others.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now.

electing their new representative next month.Four candidates - Euan Davidson , Craig Hoy , Paul McLennanand Martin Whitfield- are in the running for the role.Each week, the East Lothian Courier will give each of the candidates the chance to speak about what theyve been up to and why you should vote for them.Euan Davidson I SPENT last weekend in Dunbar and Haddington with local activists highlighting local issues of concern.The theme running through all of the problems we discussed is a lack of local empowerment.Too often, services are centralised and decisions are taken out of the hands of local people for example, the running down of services at Belhaven Hospital by the Scottish Government.If the SNP Health Secretary had agreed to a small upgrade grant back in -, signicantly more services could have been retained.Across the county, we see the same lack of joined-up thinking, with vast new housing estates lacking the essential additional infrastructure to support them: GP surgeries full, schools at capacity and non-existent public transport provision.A centralised police force has seen officers disappear from our streets.The closure of Haddingtonrsquos court forces victims and witnesses to travel into Edinburgh where there is a signicant backlog in cases.Liberal Democrats want to empower our communities to make decisions for themselves.The SNPrsquos centralising tendency damages our local services.Repeatedly, local decision-making is overturned by the Scottish Governmentrsquos reporters.Of course, media attention is focussed on the launch of the Alba Party and Kenny MacAskillrsquos defection.Mr MacAskill has said thatelected to Holyrood, he intends to stay an MP.Personally, I believe this is unacceptable.East Lothian deserves full-time representation at both Holyrood and Westminster.The other concern is that the SNP and Alba seem determined to turn this election into a referendum on independence.Itrsquos almost aswersquore not pinned down by a frightening pandemic asour economy is not on its knees aswe are not struggling against poverty and climate change emergencies asour education standards are not careering down international league tables.Letrsquos spend the next five weeks talking about what matters rather than a constitutional obsession.Craig Hoy NO SOONER was the election starting gun fired than blows were traded.Unlike normal campaigns, it wasnrsquot the cut and thrust of argument between parties hitting the headlines.Instead, Kenny MacAskill MP arrogantly turned his back on his SNP colleagues ndash and betrayed the trust of voters in East Lothian ndash by defecting to Alex Salmondrsquos Alba Party.I will fight this campaign positively, asking for the support of every pro-UK voter in this constituency.While campaigning canrsquot take place in the usual way, I have already spoken with hundreds of constituents by telephone and have delivered thousands of leaflets.Two clear themes have emerged.Firstly, people are sick of the sleaze, ision and incompetence of this SNP Government.And they no longer trust Labour on the Union.Residents donrsquot want to be dragged back to the ision of another independence referendum.Instead, they want the MSP who succeeds Iain Gray to be a strong voice for the interests of local people.Thatrsquos why I have announced five-point plans for towns and villages across East Lothian.We need to create more jobs, improve education, stop overdevelopment and tackle problems such as drugs and anti-social behaviour.The issue of tactical voting has also come up on the lsquovirtual doorsteprsquo.Labour is weak on the Union and can no longer win this seat.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has refused to rule out giving Holyrood power to hold another independence referendum.Labour wonrsquot agree to form a pro-UK coalition in opposition to the separatists.Voters fear that Labour simply canrsquot say no to Nicola Sturgeon.Anas Sarwar helped Nicola pass the Hate Crime Bill and sat on the fence over her misleading Parliament.I am clear that a vote for any of the smaller fringe parties will only split the pro-UK vote.In East Lothian, there is only one way of using your two votes to stop the SNP.By voting for me in the constituency vote ndash and Conservative on the party ballot paper ndash we can block an SNP majority and another referendum.By doing that, you will guarantee the next parliament will be focussed on rebuilding the economy and our communities.Paul McLennan AFTER meeting a number of environment groups in the past few weeks, Irsquove taken time this week to reflect on how we transform how our economy operates with improved stewardship of our environment.Societyrsquos underlying health and a sustainable environment need to be measured by more than just figures on a balance sheet.The Wellbeing Economy Allianceurges transforming how the economy operates, warning that unless we rethink who wins and who loses out ldquowe wonrsquot have a chance of delivering that goal: social justice on a healthy planet.We can explore immediately green jobs for economic development, protect wild spaces for animals to thrive and iniduals to enjoy, and sustain our landscape.The Trossachs and the Cairngorms are renowned as Scotlandrsquos only two national parks as your MSP, Irsquod work with agribusiness, rural communities, environmental and other groups to investigate the feasibility of the Lammermuirs becoming a third national park.This echoes the call by the National Trust for Scotland to explore further options for national parks in Scotland.A natural boundary between the Lothians and the Borders, the Lammermuirsrsquo stunning landscape and history would attract locals to access nature and enhance wellbeing, boosting the rural economy.Other measures specic to East Lothian are achievable, realistic and right for now, including engaging in Scotland as a recognised lsquoRe-wilding Nationrsquo.As MSP, Irsquoll also support a feasibility study for Haddington train station a planning bill overhaul to ensure new-builds include electric car points and  per cent of transport budgets designated for active transport.As a government, the SNP has introduced world-leading climate change policies.We have pledged net-zero emissions by  and are on course to meet that target.Last year, we generated . per cent of our electricity demand from renewables.This is displacing millions of tonnes of carbon a year, bringing jobs and enormous socio-economic impacts to our communities.Iceland and New Zealand, successful small democracies led by women, joined Scotland as Nicola Sturgeon pioneered the lsquoWellbeing Economy Governments Grouprsquo.Highlighting the inter-connection of personal and national wellbeing, Nicola argued ldquothe goal of economic policy should be collective wellbeing: how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy.I want East Lothian to lead on the transformative change our environment needs ndash we can be the change we all desire.Martin Whitfield I WAS joined by Scottish Labourrsquos new leader Anas Sarwar and local party members at the launch of my campaign.Its key message is that Labour will focus on what unites us and on recovery ndash not another isive referendum.Mr Sarwar told the virtual meeting that a lsquonational recovery planrsquo for Scotland would be the centrepiece of Scottish Labourrsquos election campaign, covering key priority areas for recovery from Covid, including jobs, the NHS, education, climate and communities.Speaking after the launch, Mr Sarwar said: ldquoScottish Labour, under my leadership, will make a national recovery our only priority. Itrsquos only by voting for us that you can guarantee that we have a parliament focused on recovery.I have also hit the ground running with key local campaign calls, including reiterating my support for the reinstatement of a rail service and station for Haddington, and calling for a staffed shared banking hub to be piloted in Prestonpans to bring banking services back to the town.This election is all about how we recover and rebuild after the pandemic and the fairer future that local people can havewe work together to focus on recovery.East Lothian needs a recovery plan that will deliver local jobs, remobilise our NHS, provide children with a comeback plan, deal with the climate emergency and support communities to rebuild.These are the issues I will focus on over the coming weeks to ensure that East Lothianrsquos people, communities and organisations have the support they need to come back stronger after Covid-.While I am keen to have as much contact with local residents as is allowed under the current public health restrictions, these constraints mean it mostly needs to be online at the moment.I am also continuing my work as a teacher for the early part of the campaign, so my availability is restricted.Anyone who would like to speak to me either by phone or video call should email contactus@eastlothianlabourparty to set up a meeting.More information on my campaign is at facebook martinwhitfieldeastlothian or www.eastlothianlabourparty"},{"url":null,"title":"four-candidates-confirmed-scottish-parliament-election-2021-midlothian-north-musselburgh","story":"Colin Beattie , Stevie Curran , Charles Dundasand Iain Whytewere confirmed as the four candidates for the seat at the Holyrood election when nominations closed yesterday afternoon.Mr Beattie has represented the area in Holyrood since .

North and Musselburgh seat in .He will be up against Stevie Curran , Charles Dundasand Iain Whytein the election next month.Each week, the East Lothian Courier will give each of the candidates the chance to speak about what theyve been up to and why you should vote for them.Colin Beattie THIS year we face an election like no other.Normally at this stage of an election I would be chapping doors and speaking with people on the street and at events.Covid- has made this near impossible so far.I am doing my best to get information out through social media and leafletting, and I hope that through these means I can share important information that can help you make an informed decision on May .I was tremendously encouraged when on Thursday, March , the SNP won the by-election in Midlothian East council ward.Clearly, voters continue to put their faith in the SNP to manage our country out of the double damage of Brexit and Covid-.Those twin hits are formidable.Exports of food and drink products to the EU are down  per cent following Brexit.Our fishermen have once again trusted the Tories and been dreadfully betrayed.The damage to our economy will take time to repair.The self-harm inflicted on the UK ndash and Scotland, where we voted solidly against leaving the EU ndash continues to be felt by everyone.If re-elected, the SNP Government will be ambitious:The SNP Scottish Government is determined ndash so am I.I intend to continue helping to bring new local jobs to the area and to help retain local jobs at risk.My  years as the constituency MSP have given me a tremendous knowledge and insight into businesses and communities across the constituency.Let me use it.Stevie Curran I AM DELIGHTED to have been chosen as Labourrsquos Scottish Parliamentary candidate for our constituency.Words canrsquot do justice to the sense of pride I feel knowing that I have the opportunity to represent the constituency where Irsquove lived my entire le.I live in Dalkeith, having grown up in Danderhall.Irsquom now  and married to Ann .Irsquom a Midlothian councillor for the ward of Dalkeith and Danderhall.I hold cabinet responsibilities and chair the Midlothian Police and Fire board.I have extensive experience working in the public sector, which includes over  years of employment with Lothian and Borders Police Police Scotland .My hobbies are golf and IT.Itrsquos strange that our Holyrood constituency crosses county borders, with Musselburgh, Wallyford and Whitecraig on the east side of the boundary.There are similarities between Midlothian and East Lothian, we have many shared values, but in other ways our counties are very dferent.East Lothian being a coastal authority attracts much more tourism, with a wonderful array of golf courses which I particularly enjoy.Irsquove been a member at Musselburgh Golf Clubfor over  years.Now for some of the politics of this election.I opposed independence in  and I oppose another referendum.We canrsquot risk having a parliament that focuses on old arguments or settling old scores. Scotland deserves a better government and a better opposition.Our focus must be on delivering a national recovery plan so we can build a fairer and stronger Scotland.I will be a strong voice for our communities.I will focus on a recovery plan, a health recovery, an education recovery, a jobs recovery.I will fight for opportunities for our young people and I will campaign for fairer funding for our councils.There are also local issues that require urgent intervention, probably none more so than the very poor patient experiences at Riverside Medical Practice.I cannot accept that it is not within the gt of your MSP to resolve these problems.This will be my very first task.Charles Dundas WHILST some people seem to have been distracted during the first week of this election by the fuss around a new party and defections from the SNP, Irsquom very pleased to report that Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats have kicked things off on a really positive and constructive note.Our campaign has been launched with a needle-sharp focus on putting recovery from the pandemic first.For communities like Musselburgh, that means prioritising the creation of jobs, cutting NHS waiting times, boosting mental health services and seriously tackling the climate emergency.In the first week of the campaign, our Lib Dem focus has been on setting out our plans to boost Scottish education for every stage and age: to get a good start in le to excel at school and to help people retrainthey need to.At the heart of our ideas for education are an Education Bounce Back plan to tackle the attainment gap, because we believe it is an essential investment which allows everyone in Scotland to achieve their potential.Back in , the SNP called our proposals for extra money to be allocated directly to schools and targeted at closing the poverty-related attainment gap ldquodangerous and ldquoridiculous, but we didnrsquot give up, and during the last Parliament the Scottish Government created a Pupil Equity Funding scheme to do just that on a year-by-year basis.Then in the last Scottish budget, the Lib Dems were able to secure an extra  per centto boost that scheme and do more to close the attainment gap.Now, Willie Rennie and the Lib Dems propose to make this targeted extra money for the schools who need it most a permanent feature of Scottish education, and start offering it on a long-term basis to schools so that they can make plans to invest it over multiple years with confidence.That should allow the  teachers currently employed on temporary contracts because of the uncertainty around the PEF scheme to be given more security and allow Scottish education to bounce back the way that it needs to.Iain Whyte WHILE campaigning this week, I have been investigating the car parking provision in Musselburgh.I do not agree with the suggestion from East Lothian Council of introducing parking charges at coastal car parks at Back Sands and Levenhall Links.The council is considering introducing charges here on an experimental basis in line with existing arrangements at other coastal car parks.The council has also mooted the possibility of a further review of parking charges in a much wider Musselburgh Town Centre Parking Review.The introduction of parking charges at coastal car parks further down the East Lothian coast has been deeply unpopular and I am disappointed that East Lothian Council are considering expanding the arrangements to Musselburgh.The waterfront area has seen an increase in visitors throughout the pandemic.This has been a really good thing, as people have needed that break in the fresh air to exercise and maintain their mental health.But it isnrsquot enough just to think about what happens during the remaining lockdown.We need to encourage visitors to keep visiting the area once lockdown is over.This will help to rebuild the Musselburgh economy by supporting local businesses.The same goes for the town centre car parks, which are vital to getting high street businesses back on their feet once they can reopen.Introducing car parking charges would send out entirely the wrong message and will only encourage visitors to park in locations where there is no charging.That could be very disruptive for local residents as their neighbourhood streets would become clogged with cars avoiding the charges, giving them their own parking headache.If elected, I will work with the local Conservative councillor in Musselburgh to oppose this proposal and do all I can to encourage visitors to Musselburgh to help businesses rebuild in line with the Scottish Conservative proposal for a Town Centres Revival Plan."},{"url":null,"title":"caring-dunbar-day-centre-staff-take-road","story":"Dunbar Day Centre has

We all know an insatiable Labrador .Labradors will devour everything they can get hold of. Some breeds are more picky and highly unlikely to eat anything other than a tasty morsel.There are some toy breed owners who would love their pet to eat a hearty meal every now and then.This is something to consider when buying a pup.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, behaviours, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.There are seven main classes of dog, each with their own characteristics. These are only guidelines and all dogs have their own characteristics.Border collies are generally very agile and not especially food-orientated ndash but recently, our receptionist Adele took an interesting call at our Dunedin Vets Tranent surgery, from Mrs Jane Green.She had been playing on the beach at North Berwick with her dog Zed, an exuberant -month-old Border collie. They had been having great fun on a dry, sunny morning when suddenly the ball she threw for Zed disappeared.Mrs Green was convinced Zed had swallowed it whole. There appeared to be no other explanation for the disappearing ball.Adele advised her to come to the surgery as soon as possible after ascertaining that Zed wasnrsquot choking.I have seen cases where hard balls have become lodged in dogsrsquo throats, cutting off the air supply and literally choking the dog. Always make sure the ball your dog is playing with is large enough not to lodge in their airway.Zed wasnrsquot choking and seemed remarkably bright.When he arrived at the surgery, Zed was examined by vet Rachel.She discussed the case with Mrs Green. Rachel could not feel the ball when she felt Zacrsquos abdomen, but Mrs Green was sure he had swallowed it and she showed Rachel a similar one, which was certainly too large to pass through his intestines.At this point, as vets we have to decide how to determineZed had indeed swallowed a ball, so we look to diagnostic imaging. The first thing we may consider is radiography.Only a few years ago,vets wanted to visualise the internal structures of your petrsquos body, a radiograph would be taken using an x-ray machine, which showed the image on a piece of photographic-type paper.The radiograph had to be processed manually in a dark room, using noxious chemicals, and it could take about  minutes to develop one plate.If several radiographs were required, the pet would be under anaesthetic for a prolonged period of time. Pets require sedation or general anaesthetic for radiographs to be taken.The patient has to be positioned correctly and be perfectly still whilst the radiograph is taken. This ensures the best image possible is produced at the first attempt and ensures minimal radiation exposure.Nowadays, we have digital x-rays. The patient still has to be perfectly still whilst the radiograph is taken but the processing is complete in under one minute.The images appear on a computer screen and can be viewed from dferent angles and intensities as required. Fewer radiographs need to be taken and patients are anaesthetised for much shorter times.After light sedation, Zed lay still to have his x-ray taken. This confirmed the ball was in his stomach, with the dense squeaker clearly visible.After discussion with Mrs Green, Zed went for surgery. Vet Rachel, with nurse Jenny, the anaesthetist, performed an exploratory operation to locate and remove the ball.With careful surgical skill, Rachel removed the ball from Zedrsquos stomach and checked to ensure there were no other foreign objects or damage to Zedrsquos intestinal tract.It would not be the first time that one object has been removed, only to find something  in the intestines as well!She closed the wound and Jenny monitored Zed as he recovered. He was given intravenous fluid, pain relief and antibiotics to ensure good recovery and stop infection after his operation.Once he was awake and stable, he was transferred to our out-of-hours carers at the Braids Veterinary Hospital, where he was monitored constantly until he was allowed home the following day.Zed has been examined by several vets at Dunedin Vets since hishome and, although at first quite tender and not his normal happy self, he is improving and should be back to his lively, bouncy self pretty soon.Please ensure you do not give your pets items to play with that they could swallow. They are not aware of the consequencesthey do and they may not all be as lucky as Zed."},{"url":null,"title":"dirleton-tantallon-castles-among-attractions-aiming-reopen-month","story":"The National Trust for Scotland and Historic Environment Scotland have shared plans for opening Newhailes House in Musselburgh, Preston Mill at East Linton, and Dirleton and Tantallon Castles from April  onwards, providing Scotland continues to progress out of lockdown.The grounds at Newhailes and Inveresk Lodge Garden have been accessible for exercise all through the winter.The National Trust for Scotlandhas confirmed that most of its built heritage, as well as estates and gardens across Edinburgh and the Lothians, will be open for visitors from the end of April.Historic Environment Scotlandhas said it plans to open  of its staffed sites on the same day, with more reopening on a phased basis over the coming months.All visits to Dirleton and Tantallon Castles, alongside HESrsquo other sites, must be booked in advance.Social distancing measures will be in place, as will a one-way system in some locations and contactless payments where possible.Parts of some sites, such as indoor or enclosed spaces, will be closed and visitor numbers will be limited for safety reasons.Other sites will be reopened on a phased basis over the coming months.For more information visit historicenvironment.scot our-reopening-plans-and-covid--responseNTS is urging anyone planning to visit to check the latest opening information at nts.org.uk before travelling, as some properties have dferent opening patterns this summer.

There are many stories about her travels with Diarmuid, places they hid, the adventures they had. All this time Fionn was searching for them. When he finally found them, the years seemed to have softened his anger and they made peace.ldquoSo it was a happy ending then  I canrsquot see the connection to the name of this place, though, said Finn.ldquoThe tale is not finished. Izzy stopped walking to explain what happened next.: Chapter  of Tims BookldquoYou see, the way Fionn felt inside was not the way it showed on the outside. Bitterness still festered under the surface and it showed itself when he went hunting with Diarmuid and the other warriors of the Fianna.ldquoDuring the hunt, Diarmuid was attacked by a wild boar. A prophesy had told that he would be killed by a boar and the beast savaged him. He managed to kill it, but Diarmuid lay mortally wounded.ldquoThere was one chance to save him. If Fionn gave Diarmuid water to drink from his hands, his magical powers would save his le.ldquoAh, because of his magic thumb  wondered Finn.ldquoAye, well remembered Finn.

He couldnrsquot forgive Diarmuid for his betrayal. So he deliberately let the water seep through his fingers.ldquoBut Fionnrsquos emotions were conflicting and when he saw Diarmuid dying on the ground his bitterness eased, and he ran back to the burn to collect water. But, as before, he let the water drain from his hands because, in the last moment, he still couldnrsquot forgive.: Chapter  of Tims BookIzzy began walking.ldquoSo he leaves Diarmuid to die  asked Finn, catching up with his aunt.She paused again.ldquoHis warriors, including Fionnrsquos own son Ossian, begged him to give Diarmuid water.

He walked carefully with the water in his hands. Memories of his old friendship flooded his mind. An understanding grew in him of the power of Grainnersquos love for Diarmuid and how dficult it had been for them. Fionn felt his bitterness and anger finally dissolve he could now forgive.ldquoHe knelt down by Diarmuid and carefully trickled the water onto his lips.

There was the faint sound of running water below on their right and Izzy led Finn down a small path that zigzagged steeply down a slope.They reached a burn which tumbled down the glen, with native trees lining its banks.Izzy paused by a hazel tree that leaned over the burn to catch the sunlight. Finn arrived with a thoughtful look on his face.ldquoSo that story is how Creag an Tuirc got its name  he asked.Izzy was looking for hazelnuts, so she spoke as she knelt down and foraged.ldquoNobody knows for sure how it got its name. The tale of Grainne and Diarmuid is actually an ancient legend from Ireland, but legends and stories are carried by people and planted in new places.She stood up happy, holding a hazelnut between her thumb and finger. She put it in her pocket and looked at her nephew.ldquoThere was a shared culture and language here with Ireland. Creag na Tuirc was named in Gaelic in the mists of time. Was the story of Diarmuidrsquos death told here round the fireside  For sure it was. Was the rock named to give the tale a local setting  I like to think itrsquos possible. There are lots of places in the Highlands named after these old Celtic legends. Therersquos a place called Tor an Tuirc which means hill of the boar, near Oban, and close by there is a standing stone called Diarmuidrsquos pillar. Local people said it was where he was buried. So the stories were planted here many years ago and now have roots here too. In fact, just up the road there is what tradition says is Fionnrsquos grave.ldquoReally! Aw can we go there aunty, please : Chapter  of Tims BookldquoOf course, we might even be able to see it later today, Izzy assured him.She continued her search for hazelnuts and Finn helped, but they found no more.ldquoIrsquod hoped to find nine, explained his aunt.ldquoWhy nine ldquoIrsquoll tell you later, in a story, Izzy smiled.Finn was quiet as they walked down the path by the tumbling water. Suddenly, he recognised where he was: the waterfall theyrsquod passed earlier.ldquoYou stay here and enjoy the falls, Irsquoll meet you at Rob Royrsquos grave, said Izzy as she wandered back to Balquhidder Kirk.: Chapter  of Tims BookFinn stayed a while longer, watching the water cascade over the rocks. The sound soothed him and the damp coolness of the air was welcome in what was becoming a very warm day.He eventually walked back to the kirk and emerged from the shade of the trees to see his aunt talking to a man. They broke off their conversation as soon as they saw Finn and the man walked briskly away out of the kirkyard.ldquoJust a tourist asking about Rob Roy, she explained when she saw Finnrsquos inquisitive expression.Two women then arrived.ldquoDo you know where Rob Royrsquos grave is  they asked Finn. He smiled and pointed at it.ldquoCould you take our photo please  they asked.They stood by the graveside with their thumbs up as Finn clicked a couple of times to make sure. Finn was keen to explain the mystery of the grave but they didnrsquot linger. The women thanked him and left, happy theyrsquod got their photo.As they drove away, Finn noticed the other car parked in the small parking space.He was sure it was the same car which had been parked in the layby by Samsonrsquos Stone the day before. But he thought no more of it, as his stomach began to tell him it was time for some proper food.He looked for his aunt. She was in the th-century kirk, looking at a stone with a carving of a person on it.ldquoIrsquom hungry, can we go for lunch  Finn asked.ldquoSure.They walked back to the car through the wood and past the waterfall once again.On the way, Izzy pointed out the grave of Robert Kirkrsquos we, who had died young, and the faerie hill on the northern edge of the kirkyard.It was midday and the sky was almost a Mediterranean blue.They left Balquhidder and drove towards Kingshouse at the east of the glen, which was originally built to accommodate British army officers using the military road.Balquhidder had seen its share of Redcoat atrocities in the aftermath of Culloden in , as many MacLarens had come out for Bonnie Prince Charlie.The military road had been built to make transport of the military easier, and to supply the many British army forts located in the Highlands, which were garrisoned to keep an eye on potential Jacobite trouble.As they drove out of the glen towards Loch Earn, Izzy told the tale of Capt Donald MacLaren.He had joined the Jacobites during the rising of . He was wounded and captured, then taken on a journey to England for execution. But he managed to escape while passing a place called the Devilrsquos Beef Tub in the south of Scotland, and one tradition says he ed to Balquhidder and lived many years in disguise as a woman, despite being heavily built.She told it in a funny way and Finn laughed at the image of this big bearded man dressed as a woman fooling the soldiers.ldquoHow can you remember all these stories  he asked.ldquoI remember the pictures they paint in my imagination, replied Izzy.ldquoMaybe I sometimes get some of the details wrong but for me they are portraits in my head and so when I tell the story I just describe what I see. Thatrsquos the way I remember anyway.Finn understood what she meant. Her stories had helped him paint his own portraits in his head.He was silent for a while as Izzy drove, then said: ldquoI want to phone my mum.ldquoOf course sweetie, letrsquos find a phone box and seeshersquos free.Izzy felt a wave of anxiety. She was worried that Finn might have recognised who she had been talking to at Balquhidder. She also had emotions that were not showing on the surface.She asked herselfshe was she doing the right thing. Then she looked at her nephew, who was looking out of the window while humming along to the tune she was playing.ldquoIrsquom doing it for him, she thought, ldquofocus on that."},{"url":null,"title":"national-prize-blooming-haddingtons-rab-moran","story":"ldquoLocal hero Rab Moran, , has been a member of Blooming Haddington since the group was set up in .Now, his green-fingered efforts throughout the year for the award-winning horticultural group have been recognised with a certicate of merit from the Royal Caledonian Horticultural Society, also known as The Caley.The national organisation held a virtual awards evening last month, with Mr Moran among those being recognised.The Station Court resident downplayed his role with the group and saidthat he was ldquototally shocked and surprised to receive the award.His duties with the group include watering the townrsquos  or so hanging baskets, which will be going up again in June.That means getting on the streets at am each day, with the baskets regularly winning compliments from residents and visitors, and judges from Beautul Scotland describing them as the best they had seen.He said: ldquoI was on the community council and the first year the hanging baskets were put out nobody was watering them.ldquoA lot of them died and I got involved and took it on and I have been doing it ever since.ldquoIt gets bigger and bigger and bigger, but it is great fun.

cooked food could give it a future.Caledonian Heritable Ltd was given the green light by East Lothian Council, with the Edinburgh-based developer outlining the need for things to change at the pub.A spokesperson for the group said: ldquoIt is not always the case that when a public house closes its doors because it becomes financially unviable, it merely takes another landlord to give it a quick makeover then reopen.ldquoSometimes the owner of closed public house premises is required by financial necessity to look at other uses that the buildings can be put to, or indeed whether the buildings can be taken down and something  such as housing built in their stead.ldquoIn this case, the owner of the building has taken the view that this local public house has a future, but not in its present form, and that it can once again become a popular amenity for the local village.The pub already has a kitchen to prepare and cook food.However, it was felt it was ldquonot sufficient to form the basis for re-opening the premises to the public.Now, changes will be made indoors at the pub, with alterations to the location of the toilets, as well as space for al fresco dining.Outside, an existing ancillary building and a small extension, used as a cleanersrsquo store, will be demolished.East Lothian Councilrsquos planning department approved the proposals, which did not attract any objections.Ralph Averbuch, chairman of Pencaitland Community Council, described a village pub as ldquoan institution and hoped it could now cater more for a family market."},{"url":null,"title":"letter-week-solve-parking-issues-north-berwick","story":"The implication of this for our coastal towns is that we can expect, at times, a very large influx of visitors.If our communities and the council do not plan and prepare for this, as sure as night follows day, ending lockdown will be followed by traffic chaos, parking anger and quite possibly a few irate letters to the Courier.Last summer, after the proposal to turn Elcho Green into a car park had been scrapped, a handful of North Berwick residents undertook a week-long survey of the townrsquos car parks, counting spare spaces in the morning, the middle of the day and late afternoon.The week chosen included a Friday on which the beaches were the busiest any of us had ever seen them.There were very rarely any spare spaces in the long-stay, free-to-use car parks in the town centre .Morning and afternoon there were always spaces free in the shorter-stay car parksand in the paid-forcar park.There were always Blue Badge spaces available, but on the busier lunchtimes all other spaces were full in these car parks.On the busy beach days, the parking at Recreation Park and at the station car park was also full by the middle of the day, although at all other times there were spaces at these.Even on the very busiest days, the car parks at the sports centre and the high school were virtually empty, and the car parks of Tesco and Aldi also had spare capacity.No one can expect to be able to park where they want, when they want, for as long as they want, all at no cost.Building more car parks is not viable.The only sites proposed are ones where any other form of development would not be tolerated.Any gain for drivers would be small compared to the loss of amenity, and any parking created would not be adequate.The solution is to use the parking resources that we have more efficiently.If you have an errand which requires a car, avoid lunchtime.Your best bet is to get in and out before am.If you can manage your trip to town without using a car, walk or cycle instead.On the really busy beach days, we need to do more than leave matters to first-come first-served.Even good signage, although helpful, will not solve the problem alone.Anyone who recalls the traffic gridlock on Marine Parade last year will know that what is required is some active traffic management: closing the road to the Haugh car park when it is full, and having helpful and friendly guides at Marine Parade and where directing visitors to the places they might find a place to park firstly to the Rec or the station and, once those car parks are full, to the school and the sports centre.Robbie Wightman,Clford Road,North

about , patients ndash which was making it ldquoreally hard for patients to get through on the phone and book an appointment.It comes as an online petition has been launched by patients calling for ldquourgent change.The number of call attempts to the practice, the largest in East Lothian, rose sharply in March after a period where the number of call attempts were slowly decreasing to pre-Covid- pandemic levels.The Riverside, which is based at Musselburgh Primary Care Centre, said that the pattern of call attempts had changed too, as more calls were made at am to try and book an appointment, with a larger number of redials being seen.Dr Richard Fairclough, GP partner, said: ldquoWersquore looking at all of the data we get via our phone system as quickly as possible, so we can understand the full extent of the situation that we and the local community are facing.ldquoWersquore also trying to better quanty all the dferent reasons people call, so we can better understand how to best direct patients to other more appropriate health services, and to our online services.ldquoBut one thing is apparent: demand is completely outstripping the health systemrsquos capacity to meet that need, and there are more people needing an appointment than each appointment we have available. This has been the case for some time.ldquoThis means that some people are being left without the expert support from their GP that we desperately want to offer, and we recognise the depth of feeling in the community about this.ldquoWersquore doing absolutely everything we can to try and improve the situation, including increasing the number of clinical and non-clinical staff we have, and working to improve our phone system and the way we manage calls we receive.ldquoWe need to be clear, though, that all of these changes will take time and will not improve the situation overnight.ldquoOnce all of the recruitment is completed, we will be at the limit of people we can employ at the practice, so the number of calls we can answer and the number of appointments we then have available will not substantially increase without wider health system change.ldquoThe practice met with Colin Beattie MSP last week, along with East Lothian Health and Social CarePartnership, community councils and our patient participation group, all of whom have expressed their willingness to work collaboratively with us to bring change.ldquoWersquove made clear to all the pressure wersquore experiencing and the impact this has for people in Musselburgh and for our staff. Wersquove also made clear the changes that need to happenpeople in Musselburgh are to have their health needs met ndash namely a rapid move to put in place the changes the Scottish Government has already agreed must happen right across Scotland to relieve what was recognised several years ago as an unsustainable workload in general practice.ldquoThese changes include the movement of urgent care, pharmacotherapy , vaccinations and community nursing away from general practice, to come instead under the control of local health and social care partnerships. This will allow GPs to focus on their role as expert medical generalists, working to improve the long-term health of both iniduals and the wider community they serve.ldquoAs Musselburgh continues to grow, we also urgently need to hear from those overseeing the development of the town to hear how they plan to service the primary care needs of the community.The online petition launched by patients says: ldquoPatientsrsquo frustrations are running high as appointments are increasingly dficult and mostly impossible to secure.ldquoWait times on calls to connect to the surgery are often in excess of an hour, only to be told there are no appointments available and the patient needs to call back the following day to repeat the frustrating process, with no guarantee of an appointment at the end.ldquoReports of calls being made every day for a week with no success in securing an appointment are now commonplace.ldquoUrgent change is needed, as the health of patients registered with the practice is being put at risk on a daily basis.ldquoThe staff within the practice are working flat out but it is obvious demand far exceeds supply.The petition will be lodged with the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Cabinet Health Minister and Lothian Health Board Patient Experience Committee.They are being asked to intervene and assist the practice ldquoto analyse their current problems, thereafter equip them with the resources needed to implement an accessible appointment system which will, in turn, provide comprehensive medical care for every registered patient at the practice.The petition is at change.org p patients-registered-with-riverside-practice-riverside-practice-appointment-systemThe practice said it was pleased that its patients were adding their voices to the calls for change.A spokesperson for the East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership, said: ldquoELHSCP is already delivering a wide range of self-referral services that offer patients sameday access to specialist clinical, mental health and MSK supportin Musselburgh and across the county.

Pro tip: stop unnecessarily opening the lid of your barbecue ndash oxygen feeds the flames, giving you less control.

Eggs symbolise new le, and often appeared in pagan festivals celebrating spring.And for Christians, the egg symbolises the moment in the Bible when Jesus is resurrected after his crucixion.As the tradition evolved over the centuries, chocolate versions of eggs became more popular as gts for children than real eggs - for obvious reasons.The first chocolate eggs appeared in France and Germany during the th century, but they were bitter and hard.Yet as chocolate-making techniques began to improve, Cadbury produced the first modern chocolate Easter egg that we enjoy today in .The chocolatier used a pure cocoa butter that could be easily moulded into the smooth shape.Hollow chocolate Easter eggs quickly became popular, and they still remain a favourite Easter tradition with many around the world.A lot of people also give up chocolate for lent, so indulging in some chocolate eggs became a common way to mark the end of the Christian fasting period.As well as consuming chocolate eggs, there are other egg-related Easter traditions that are synonymous with the religious holiday.Rolling hard-boiled eggs is a favoured activity, and for Christians this is a symbolic re-enactment of when the stone was rolled away from Christrsquos tomb in the Bible.Painting and decorating hard-boiled eggs is also a beloved tradition that children especially enjoy.These two activities often go hand-in-hand, with children painting their eggs before finding a hill to roll them down until they crack.An Easter egg hunt is another popular tradition many take part in over the Christian weekend.Chocolate treats are hidden around the garden or the house, ready to be found by family members - and the winner is the person who finds more than anyone .The Easter bunny is said to arrive over the weekend, hiding eggs for when children wake up on Easter Sunday.There are numerous tales surrounding the origins of the Easter bunny.One is that the rabbit comes from the ancient pagan festival of Eostre, which honoured the goddess of fertility and spring.Her animal symbol is believed to have been a rabbit, which traditionally represents fertility.Meanwhile, in America, some people believe that the Easter bunny was introduced in the s by German immigrants in Pennsylvania.Their egg-laying hare, known as ldquoOsterhase or ldquoOschter Haws, was said to lay colorful eggs as gts to children who behaved well.The Easter bunnys egg delivery then evolved over time to include treats such as toys and chocolate."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-covid-vaccine-certificate-app-explored-lockdown-freedom","story":"Jeane Freeman said that ethical and equality questions would need to be kept under review ndash but added that she favours a digital certicate over a paper version to reduce any unnecessary burden on the NHS.Her comments came ahead of a Downing Street news conference later on Monday at which the Prime Minister is expected to set out further details on the planned certication scheme in England.Proposals were announced at the weekend for a ldquoCovid status certication scheme ndash dubbed ldquovaccine passports ndash for mass gatherings south of the border, from sporting events to nightclubs.The UK Government has said the certicates could be a mobile phone app or a paper document and they are expected to show whether an inidual has received the vaccine, has recently tested negative for the virus, or has ldquonatural immunity having tested positive in the previous six months.Ms Freeman told BBC Radio Scotlandrsquos Good Morning Scotland programme there are ethical and equality questions over vaccine passports as not everyone can be inoculated.She also said there are questions over how the scheme would work.Ms Freeman said: ldquoWersquore currently looking at what would be the digital infrastructure you would need for any form of certication, as we work through those ethical and equality and practical questions about how it might be used and in what circumstances.ldquoI donrsquot want it to be paper ndash where itrsquos possible Irsquod want it to be digitally done. I donrsquot want to put an unnecessary burden on our health service ndash on our GP practices, for example ndash with everyone going to them to get the bit of paper that says lsquoYes, Irsquove been vaccinatedrsquo.Last week, Nicola Sturgeons said certicates for both international and domestic use is something that ldquoshould be considered.Speaking at a media briefing in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoIn general terms I agree that it should be looked at.ldquoI think we should consider how we use some sort of vaccine certication to open up more in the future.ldquoWersquove got to be careful and considered about how we do that.ldquoThere are still some questions that we still donrsquot fully know the answer to about the vaccine and its impact on transmission ndash although the early data on that is all very positive.However, she added there are ldquobig ethical questions about the certicates.She said: ldquoThere are some people who canrsquot get vaccinated for medical reasons, for example, so we need to think through all this.ldquoThe Scottish Government is thinking about it and we are participating in the international and UK-wide work on this as well.ldquoSo, itrsquos not something that I think is practical right now, but in the future it is possible and I think it is important that we give it proper and due consideration.ldquoWersquove already had some four nations discussions around this so wersquore all thinking through these things in the same way."},{"url":null,"title":"queues-outside-salons-hairdressers-barbers-east-lothian-open-first-time-year","story":"Hair salons across East Lothian have been closed since Christmas as Scotland entered its second lockdown on Boxing Day.With restrictions continuing, many have been forced to stay closed for the first three months of the year and residents unable to visit for their regular trim.But from today , hairdressers with a salon shopfront are able to reopen, an easing of the current rules that was confirmed by Scotlandrsquos First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last week.And it is clear to see that many people have been eagerly anticipating and waiting for their chance to finally get that long-awaited chop with queues spotted and appointments quickly filling up.One barbers on Quality Street in North Berwick saw several customers waiting in a queue outsidewith people also said to be queuing outside a barbers in Tranent.Many are only accepting pre-booked appointments with customers unable to walk in and the wearing of face-masks essential while in the salon."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-lockdown-update-key-bits-coronavirus-briefing","story":"The First Minister was providing a media briefing from St Andrewrsquos House in Edinburgh, during which time she confirmed the Scottish Governmentrsquos plans around theof schools.She also highlighted the progress Scotland has made against the virus, but warned that ldquoCovid is down, but not out, urging people not to drop their guard.It comes after an easing of lockdown restrictions on Monday.From today in Scotland:# More retail services, hairdressers and barbers can open# - year olds can resume outdoor contact sports# More college students canto campus#StayLocal unless your journey is essential.Full details # https:t.co apvBgDYEd pic icYXZQkOJaHere, we outline the key points from todayrsquos briefing.All pupils in Scotland ndash except those shielding ndash will be back in the classroom full time following the Easter holidays, the First Minister told the Scottish Government briefing.That means ato classroom for most secondary school pupils on April .Those in the shielding category are hoped to be allowed back into the classroom by April .Ms Sturgeon said: ldquo\"This is, I know, a huge relief to many children and young people ndash and of course to many parents and carers.\"I know, however, that it will also be a source of concern for some people.

As Thorn sat in the dressing room, the door opened and the Go-Betweens drummer Lindy Morrison walked in asking to borrow some lipstick at the top of her voice. Older, noisier, more self-assured, Thorn was enthralled. ldquoYou looked like confidence ran in your veins, she writes of that first encounter.ldquoShe just seemed other, you know, Thorn says of Morrison now in March , nearly  years later. ldquoShe was older than me,  years older. I think that is important. I was only . I was still at that stage of being right at the beginning of everything, not really knowing who I was, who I wanted to be. Embarking on this career of being in the music business, but not at all sure whether I wanted to or how I was going to do it.ldquoAnd there she is. She seems on the face of it to be my opposite, in that she seems supremely self-confident, supremely self-defined, to know exactly who she is, to not take any shit from anyone. When yoursquore young and looking around for role models and examples of how to be, you seize upon people like that.It was to be the start of a friendship that would long outlast the bands the two women were members of back then. Some four decades later it has led Thorn to write a book about her friend, the reason she is talking to me on Zoom from her home in London this afternoon.Thorn would go on to see huge success as part of Everything But the Girl. Morrison would stay with The Go-Betweens until  when the band broke up after their last-chance album  Lovers Lane still didnrsquot make them stars. Although their paths erged in the intervening years, Thorn and Morrison, through ups and downs and though a world apart, remained in touch.Lindy-Morrison and Tracey Thorn on Hampstead-Heath,. Photograph Ben WattMy Rock rsquonrsquo Roll Friend, then, is a story about friendship. But itrsquos more than that. Itrsquos also a vehicle for Thorn to write Morrison back into the story of The Go-Betweens, a band whose narrative has been continuously refined and reduced to that of the two songwriters, Robert Forster and the late Grant McLennan. In doing so, Thorn also tackles the wider subject of female erasure in music how men literally write women out of the story.The result is funny, candid and, as the pages pass, increasingly indignant. By the end you can feel the anger rising off the pages.It is also, for those of us who grew up worshipping at the altar of Forster and McLennan, something of a challenge. Have we as fans been just as guilty of that act of erasure It may also be the best book Thorn has written. It certainly feels the most open, the most candid in a way, assome of Morrisonrsquos energy and outspokenness has rubbed off on her friend on the page.ldquoI think thatrsquos true, Thorn acknowledges. ldquoI almost wanted to allow that to happen a bit, let the spirit of Lindy animate the book.And so here is Thorn talking about desire and distress, about recent relationship struggles with Watt, about swimming naked in a spa in Covent Garden. In writing as in le, Thorn has been emboldened through her friendship with Morrison.Morrisonrsquos own story goes like this. In Brisbane in the late s she was in her mid-twenties and in a female punk band called Zero when she met Robert Forster. He is some six years younger than her. His band The Go-Betweens are the antithesis of punk. But Morrison saw something in them, something in Forster certainly. Soon they became a couple and when Morrison joined The Go-Betweens as their drummer the band became worthy of notice.Tracey Thorn. Photograph: Edward BishopldquoShe made them a band, Thorn suggests. ldquoThey were fumbling along, two boys being a duo with these other members who came and went. They didnrsquot have a band identity. And then suddenly theyrsquove got Lindy Morrison who was already semi-famous in the relatively small music scene of Brisbane. That was an audacious act to get her to join them. It was a great thing to do. That was a strength that they should always have played up really.As the years went by the opposite happened. The band became defined by Forster and McLennanrsquos wordplay. They were a band who were loved for their lyrics. But would either have managed to get anywhere without Morrisonrsquos drive, Thorn asks Morrison adapted her playing to their songs. ldquoShe didnrsquot straighten them out, Thorn points out. ldquoThey did have that sort of angularity about them. They didnrsquot know how many bars they were writing. They just wrote how many bars it needed to get to the end of that line of lyric.Read More: Remembering the Go-Betweens with Robert ForsterRead More: Christmas with Tracey ThornldquoA more prosaic drummer might have said, lsquoOK, you need to edit this a bit. We need to square it off.rsquo She said, lsquoWell, letrsquos go with it. Let the songs have this curiousandyoursquove written it like that, Irsquoll play it like that.rsquo That gives the band a lot of character.There were constant tensions in the band, it should be said. Forster and Morrison eventually fell out yet continued to play together. McLennan, meanwhile, never seemed to like Morrison. When Amanda Brown joined the band she was McLennanrsquos girlfriend, but she was also an ally for Morrison.What is very clear from the book is that when Morrison joined the band she was the one with the le experience. Itrsquos also quickly clear that even sensitive young men with an interest in art and literature can be painfully conventional in their attitude towards women.ldquoThatrsquos often one of the most frustrating things, I think, for women in the music scene or probably other worlds of art, Thorn suggests. ldquoYoursquore drawn to those scenes for the same reasons as men are, because yoursquore looking for freedom and liberation from the straight world and yoursquore looking for expression and to shake off the conventions.ldquoAnd then, within that world of music, when you encounter the same narrow thinking, the same conventions, the same prejudices, the same stereotypes, its intensely frustrating. And when you encounter that in the men you are working with, who you have been drawn to because you admire their creativity and artistry, itrsquos a really frustrating thing.That played out in Morrisonrsquos encounters with male music journalists. She was too loud for them, too outspoken. She didnrsquot fit with their idea of the band. Frankly, some of them were scared of her.After years of never quite making it, Forster and McLennan decided to go solo in . Forster arranged to tell Morrison at exactly the same time as McLennan told Brown, a move that was both theatrical and spectacularly foolish as it turned out. ldquoThe brutal display of where the power lies, is how Thorn describes it in My Rock rsquonrsquo Roll Friend. Both women understandably saw it as an act of betrayal. How could the two men have thought they would see it as anything  ldquoIt is extraordinary and naiumlve, Thorn agrees. ldquoThey try to excuse themselves. lsquoWe were just bumbling boys.rsquo They were men in their thirties. It is very easy for men to play this card: lsquoOh well, we didnrsquot know what we were doing.rsquo At some point you have to take responsibility.In the years after the band split up and particularly after the tragically early death of McLennan at just  of a heart attack, the story of The Go-Betweens has been increasingly retold as the story of the two men. Thatrsquos certainly how Forster framed it in the title of his memoir Grant  I.And so, one of the reasons Thorn wanted to write My Rock rsquonrsquo Roll Friend, she says, was the fear that Morrison was in danger of being left out of the story.This is the crux of things. This idea of erasure. It repeats and repeats in the music industry. Itrsquos why someone like Bjork has to time and again assert her own agency when she makes music, why she has to remind people that she is responsible for it, not her male collaborators.ldquoItrsquos endless, Thorn agrees. ldquoAnd it becomes exhausting, and so I think sometimes women fall by the wayside because they get defeated by it and also start to believe their own press. You start to believe, lsquoMaybe I wasnrsquot that important.rsquoMy Rock rsquonrsquo Roll Friend is an act of reclamation, then.ldquoI think that itrsquos happening more and more now. More and more women are starting to write their books, from Viv Albertine to Chrissie Hynde. It does feels to me some of these stories that had slipped out of our attention hellip When you look back at punk it was always the Sex Pistols and The Clash. Yeah, but hang on. I was there. X-Ray Spex and The Slits were as important. But those stories are now being told.If nothing , My Rock rsquonrsquo Roll Friend serves as a reminder that without Morrison the story of the Go-Betweens would be a lot less interesting. Because for all her complexity and vulnerabilities what emerges from the pages of Thornrsquos book is just how much fun Morrison was and is.ldquoAs well as there being anger in there, I did want there to be joy, Thorn admits. ldquoAs I say at one point, lsquothe sheer f****** buzz of being in her company.rsquo I want that to come through the book as well. That yoursquore just thinking, lsquoMy God, shersquos a hoot.rsquoldquoShe is and shersquos unpredictable and shersquos contradictory and you donrsquot know what shersquoll say next. All that about her is kind of brilliant. Shersquos not a neatly packaged entity.What does that make her  Human, I guess. And fun to be with.

I was then learning about investing and saving, building side hustles and all things to do with money that I had never been exposed to when I was growing up.I wanted to share that journey becauseI needed information then there might well have been someone  out there who would like to know this information as well. I picked up a camera and have been creating content to help people ever since.I thoroughly enjoy it, so much so that I have left my corporate job to do this.Q: What was the inspiration behind starting the channel A: It really was out of necessity a little bit - wanting to share a journey with other people, and in some way, I have been in IT sales all my le as well. Irsquove had to talk to customers and get over a message and I really like helping people and teaching people.It just felt really fun, I saw a lot of Youtube channels of other people talking away to cameras and I thought, I could do that, that seems really good fun and I could help people about money. Particularly our own money,I hadnrsquot learned about how to pay off debt and investing and been stuck for UK voices to find - I donrsquot think I would have started a channel, so that was the inspiration behind it.:Mamafurfur: Meet the Glasgow Youtuber with a finance channel that has reaped rewardsQ: You started making videos in  - how have you found the process A: The process has been quite straightforward. I think, as with everything, when you start itrsquos a case of lsquojust do your first video, just tal to the camera and do the best you canrsquoBut the process always feels the same. I love being able to communicate a message. I am always hoping I do it as concisely and also as entertaining as possible because I do believe the knowledge can be le-changing and really affect a lot of people once they learn things and they think lsquowhy wasnrsquot I taught this before rsquoThe process I have found just the same as always. I found it simple, straightforward but I also love that part of my creative journey is I want to be better and better. I want to get over the message better, I want to be somebody who is conveying as quickly as possible but also get that lsquoclickrsquo moment with people. So yoursquoll from the very start of my videos to three years ago, theyrsquore dferent in terms of quality and how I deliver and the topics I deliver. I love the fact its an ongoing evolution for my viewer and also for myself.Q: What are the aims of your channel A: My aims are a journey for people. I want people to go from financial stress and mess, feeling stuck, to giving people a route out of that, to actually have a lestyle that they designed using money as a tool rather than something that dictates what you do with your time.Also, I want people to have freedom, time freedom in their le, so using money thatthey want to work part-time they can,they want to be creative and run their own business they canthey want to work for someone  they can. I want people to have time freedom and the one way to get it is using money to make that happen.Q: You are very open on your channel about your aims and ambitions - how have you found the transition to ldquofull time on the Mama FurFur channel in comparison to your old ldquo-A: I have found it fairly smooth, and I think thatrsquos been guided by the fact that we have been in a pandemic for the past year. I have been at home, my job had the flexibility to work from home anyway, so I was used to being at home and balancing le with the boys, so the transition has been quite smooth.The one thing I do notice is I am having to learn to manage my time dferently because I am used to having an employer, and also projects, and also a family, itrsquos realising that I donrsquot answer to an employer anymore so I have to decide what we do with our day and keep focussed on goals and things that I feel I want to create out there. style\" background:#FFF border: border-radius:px box-shadow:  px  rgba, px px  rgba margin:  auto max-width:px padding: width:.% width:-webkit-calc width: auto\" display:block height:px margin: auto -px position:relative top:-px width:px\"LoadingQ: You have found success on Youtube - what would be your advice to those starting out A: YouTube is just a social media  like anything . YouTube however I feel is one of the tougher ones to break into. I think you have to assume that you might have to put out a year or two of content every single week to then get traction. So I would say make sure you are clear about why you are using this .Is it to help other people  If so then just keep with that intention. I think sometimes people start because they want to make money and that will just lead you down a black hole, there will never be enough money because you will just keep chasing and chasing. It should be because you believe you can actually help people as part of what you see as your vision and goal for le. It is a fantastic tool though - I am really thankful I use Youtube because I like video.I would say start today, just put out your first video but assume that it is going to take a little while to get traction, but do not be disheartened. Donrsquot worry about views, clicks, and likes, just make videos you are proud of and then whatever rewards come your way, thats whatrsquos meant to be.Honoured to be up for Best Personal Finance Influencer . Nominations form is open! https:t.co OstbgzkiwsQ: As well as the Youtube channel you offer courses and books - do you have any further plans to expand A: Absolutely, we have products as well. There are going to be more books on the way, so I am making the time now to write and get those books started. I would like to reach more people and thatrsquos what I feel is the next part of that. Irsquove got products, Irsquove got things online but I know physical books touch people and help people in a dferent way. If there are any publishers or agents reading this, Irsquove got the books lined up, just get in contact. Irsquod love to see my book in WH Smith, thatrsquos one of my visions and my goals - to be able to go to the airport and see my book there. That would be absolutely incredible going into Glasgow Airport and being able to get a copy of my books.Q: What were the major challenges starting out A: Major challenges are mainly just your self-belief a lot of the time. Irsquove never worried about whether I could deliver or have got enough messages to tell people. I think at times its just getting over yourself and realising it is a long journey and that you keep just doing what you feel is right.Q: You talk often about ldquoside hustles on your channel - but how do you start out making your videos  What is the approach to taking on topics Making videos is just as simple as you can pick up your phone and record and upload to Youtube andyou feel like you have a message, maybe its your story that yoursquove got to share about a particular experience in le or you want to help somebody .I just broke down topics I was learning about that I was struggling to find information about for the UK, so I thoughtI canrsquot find them, this is what I have been able to find, hopefully somebody  can find it. So thatrsquos all I do. Irsquove got a big brain-dump of topics, hundreds of topics that I want to cover and I just select and thatrsquos what I have been doing for three years. I just select the ones that I feel great about, that I feel inspired and I make them, I just put them out there and thatrsquos all I can do.Q: How has the Covid- pandemic changed your channel  Has it had an impact It hasnrsquot my channel in terms of any impact but obviously, I did find that a lot of people were looking for topics on money during the pandemic at the start, and hopefully, they found my channel useful and that was a great help. I did feel inspired to focus on more basics of money for the past while I was very aware people might be feeling they had income struggles, so I wanted to show people how to make extra income, how to save, spend well and invest even.I think it was more being aware of what was happening and what were the pain points people might be feeling, and then being driven to make content that could help.Q: What would be your advice to those starting out on Youtube and a channel in particular A: Just pick up the camera and start. The more you do something the better yoursquoll get. Donrsquot be worriedthere are only four views on your first video, there were four people that found you. Also make videos that yoursquore proud of that will help people. Also just have fun with it , make it as a way you can express yourself and what yoursquore interested in.Q: You recently reported people imitating your channel on Instagram - how concerning is this especially around the financial advice and explainers you carry out on your channel A: There are always people who,they can, theyrsquoll find a way to make money from other people. Theyrsquoll borrow your image or brand, set up accounts and what theyrsquore doing is use your image to try and convince people that theyrsquore trustworthy. I will always say to someone I am not going to recommend a forex trading  or anything that seems dodgy, I am certainly not going to ask you for thousands of pounds to trade with me.Unfortunately, all you can do is report to Instagram or Facebook, a lot of the time they donrsquot get taken down but thatrsquos all you can do. If it seems dodgy, a lsquoget rich quickrsquo scheme, it probably is. Irsquom sorry that theyrsquore using my face but thatrsquos probably how these people believe theyrsquoll get you to trust them, which is a wee bit sad.Q: What is your typical day-to-day as part of your business A: A typical day at the moment is getting up, having breakfast and I will have quiet time, and make my husband a cup of tea. I will do some reading from inspirational books and then focus on getting the right intention, the right focus for the day. The boys will get up, I will make them breakfast, wersquoll head off to school and nursery and then Matt, my husband at that time will have been at the gym and then I will go into the gym. And then I will make content or do something for the business. A typical day is we hit the gym as a priority after getting the kids to school, then we focus, maybe do a podcast or a video, do some planning, and then the boys are back from school and we spend time with them.I try to stop my work when the boys get back from school because I canrsquot really film when theyrsquore around but also itrsquos family time. Thatrsquos the whole point of running your own business - you decide the hours.Q: You have your channel based from Glasgow - what has the response been from Scots but also globally A: Scottish people will always leave a comment and say ldquoOh Irsquom from Glasgow or Edinburgh which is fantastic. I love that and I love also that some people have said because I am Glasgweigan theyrsquove been able to relate to me, I seem like a local person. Some people might find my accent dficult to understand but thankfully Youtube offers subtitlesthats the case, but overall I donrsquot think being Scottish holds me back. If anything it makes me stand out more because therersquos quite a lot of UK creators from England. I love the fact that its another element thats quite unique and will maybe stick out in peoplersquos heads.Q: What are the future aims of the channel and the business A: Future aims for us are to ensure that Mamafurfur keeps helping as many people as possible. Thatrsquos one of my goals. I just want to keep doing what I believe feels right for me. I really feel inspired to be a teacher and help people and I want to be true to that. I want to get more books out because I really believe I can help more people out.In the same way that we were able to get out of debt and leave the corporate world and have passive incomes and investments, that really quick journey in over pretty much six years from start to finish, and allowing us to grow a multi-six figure side hustle and business in the process. I know that and some of the strategies that people can apply and change their lives. I want that for as many people as possible.I do believe that when people have good money and theyrsquore able to do things with time freedom has a ripple effect on communities. Theyrsquore able to give more time to things they believe in.The short term is focussing on content to help people and focusing on books, and I am open to wherever the business takes me."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12358122.jpg?type=article-full","title":"brian-taylor-independence-snp-dream-hesitates-speak-name","story":"I took the opportunity to ask Labourrsquos then General Secretary, Jack McConnell, to confirm that the electoral system planned for the devolved Scottish Parliament had been devised specically to prevent the SNP from taking power with a minority of the popular vote.With admirable brevity, Mr McConnell replied: ldquoCorrect.Mostly deploying ier statements, Jack McConnell went on to serve as First Minister for a prolonged period, surmounting the proportional voting system by sustaining a coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats. He is generally credited with steadying the listing ship of devolved governance. by Brian taylor: Strugeons inquiry performance was controlled and capableNow Nicola Sturgeon is seeking re-election under that same Additional Member System. Devised, remember, to thwart her party. An exercise which has not been entirely successful in that the SNP has held sway at Holyrood since Mr McConnell demitted office in .But she faces an additional challenge. In addition to her customary opponents, she has to contend with a former chum. Her erstwhile mentor Alex Salmond is seeking to confound that Holyrood voting system by seeking regional list seats to supplement the constituencies he expects his former party, the SNP, to retain or gain.Mr Salmond describes that as a super-majority for independence. For that sum to work, however, there would have to be an almost universal transfer of list votes from the highly competitive SNP to Alba, presumably eclipsing the pro-independence Greens while, at the same time, the pro-Union parties fail to take advantage of this apparent contention on the Nationalist side.To say the least, that is asking a lot. Still, it is feasible and Mr Salmond remains a persuasive campaigner, despite the poll suggestions that, after years of controversy, accusation, acquittal and inquiry, he is rather less popular than was formerly the case.In passing, one might also note that his concept of vying up the independence vote was not discussed with or ratied by Nicola Sturgeon in any way. Further, it runs precisely counter to the message Mr Salmond himself delivered when he won majority power in . Then, the endlessly repeated mantra was ldquoboth votes SNP.Again, though, it remains a possibility in pursuit of what Mr Salmond has called the ldquonoble cause of independence. Contrary to claims that he is intent on vengeance, he insists he is only too eager to help that broader aim, as he has always done.Alex SalmondWhich presents Nicola Sturgeon with a dilemma. Could she conceivably work with a man who told a Holyrood inquiry she had breached the Ministerial code  A man who, she informed the same inquiry, had recounted behaviour towards a woman which she regarded as ldquodeeply inappropriate Before we arrive at such hypothetical post-election scenarios, however, there is the small matter of winning popular support from the voters.This lands Nicola Sturgeon with a more elemental conundrum. To be clear, she yearns for independence. She craves it, like a gourmet treat, all the more appealing for being kept at a distance, and denied by rivals.How, though, to achieve it  Strategically, she has three good reasons for focusing more in this election upon other policies, other issues, while retaining independence as the over-arching aim, through a referendum. In the BBC Scotland debate this week, she said such a poll should be held in the first half of the new Holyrood Parliament, once coronavirus had subsided.Those reasons for caution  Firstly, just like Jack McConnell promoting devolution in , she knows that independence lacks universal popularity. Many remain to be convinced.Even some who ultimately favour or would acquiesce in an independent Scotland might prefer to concentrate for now on other matters, notably this hideous plague and the attendant economic challenge.So she couches independence not as a concept in itself but as a potential answer to those financial woes a solution to be adopted when the time is right. Not immediately. For now, the SNP mot is that Scotlandrsquos problems need Scottish solutions, not a recipe advanced by Boris Johnson.Simultaneously, she is aware that this approach, which she judges to be necessary to sustain widespread popular support for her government, with its range of policies and objectives, is scarcely calculated to enthuse the more zealous of her adherents in the wider nationalist cause.That partly explains the lingering disquiet in the SNP over strategy. It, partly, explains the creation of Alba, although that is very largely down to Mr Salmond.Which brings us to Ms Sturgeonrsquos second reason for caution. An over-emphasis on independence might serve to energise Mr Salmondrsquos offer, to her dismay. In her mind, she sees an all too familiar figure, with an all too familiar grin, offering to help.Thirdly, every time she talks up independence or is asked so to do, we can expect an intervention from Douglas Ross of the Tories or, indeed, from Labour or the Liberal Democrats.Mr Ross is simply itching to make this election a quasi-referendum, to make it a straight fight between independence and the Union, hoping that he will, thereby, cajole indy-sceptics from other parties to vote Tory.A further thought disturbs the Sturgeon sleep pattern. She accuses Mr Salmond of gambling, of seeking to trick the electorate into a referendum. What , she asks, that leaves a residue of discontent and disquiet, even among potential independence supporters, so that any subsequent referendum is lost Mr Salmond denies this would happen and argues that Ms Sturgeon would, eventually, see the advantage of collaboration.Read more by Brian Taylor:Sturgeon versus Salmond. Here are the game plans for the socially distanced electionA closing anecdote. I recall chatting to a senior political strategist who had been struggling to explain to obdurate colleagues the tactical subtleties of electoral campaigning under the Single Transferable Vote in multi-member council wards.Finally, in exasperation, he yelled at them: ldquoLook, this isnae politics.

Indeed, in rejecting Salmondrsquos idea of a two-party supermajority as ldquogaming the system she may have skewered indyref.After May ,her pro-independence majority is composed, as looks likely, of SNP constituency and Green list MSPs, it will be hard to claim this as a new mandate for a referendum.Boris Johnson will just quote her own words back at her.

Alex Salmond was able to beat drsquoHondt in  only because of a unique set of circumstances.However, I do not subscribe to the view that the First Minister has given up on Scottish independence. It is in her DNA as much as it is in Alex Salmondrsquos. However, her body language in last weekrsquos BBC debate, in which she was hectored and harried over the timing of indyref, indicated her discomfort with the whole question.She clearly has other things on her mind ndash the pandemic for one ndash and has now shted the rhetoric on independence totake that into account. Independence is no longer to be seen as a necessary condition for a successful recovery, but something only to be considered ldquoafter the crisis is over, as she put it. That crisis could last for some years yet.The Scottish economy was lagging behind the rest of the UK before Covid. Structural problems are going to be revealed as UK Government support is withdrawn.As they say in America, when the tide goes out you find out whorsquos not wearing a bathing suit.In those circumstances, with unemployment rising, would the First Minister really want to ignite a isive referendum campaign evenshe could  As I say, itrsquos too soon to write off Alba, but one message could be that, while Scots may be increasingly attracted to the concept of independence, they may not be in the market for it right now. Lord make me free, but not yet.Onlyyou are a radical, an insurgent, a risk-taker ndash yes, a gambler ndash does independence really makes sense, at least right now.A politician like Alex Salmond doesnrsquot care about polls or the precautionary principle he makes his own history. Salmond is right that only a mass, popular movement could make the independence cause become unanswerable. It would require big street demonstrations, court actions, civil disobedience. History would need to be placed on fast forward, as it was in Ireland at the start of the last century. Thatrsquos a risky road.Nicola Sturgeon is not arisk-taker, not a revolutionary, and recoils from fighting talk and ision. Itrsquos all too testosterone-fuelled for her. Most middle-class Scots share her risk aversion.One of the abiding themes of Scottish politics over the past  years has been votersrsquo enthusiasm for gradations of home rule that always stop short of actual independence.It might be that Ms Sturgeonrsquos very caution is part of her popularity. She is intensely Scottish, hostile to English Tories, but she can be relied upon not to do anything daft.The independence case is anyway in deep trouble. In , Salmond managed to persuade  per cent of Scots to vote Yes but only after it was made clear that it would not mean a border with England, or losing the pound, or even losing the Queen. Both Scotland and England were assumed to be remaining in the EU. That has all changed.Nicola Sturgeon has avoided discussion of the mechanics of independence post-Brexit, preferring to stick to generalities about how Scots need to take their own decisions and not be under dictation from Brexit Tories.But she knows, and everyone in her Government knows, that the situation is very dferent to . Last weekrsquos report from the Institute for Government underlined in red dficulties that simply canrsquot be ignored.It is true that the act of joining the European Union might only take two to four years ndash the blink of an eye in Brussels terms. But disaggregating the UK would take much longer. Scotland would have to be fully independent of the UK and that would take at least five years going on the Brexit experience.The Institute reckons that wersquod be looking at a decade of complex negotiations before Scotland became a member of the EU.The idea that Brussels might allow some kind of halfway house, letting Scotland join while it was still part of the UK, is a non-starter. It was something the EU refused to consider even before the Northern Ireland Protocol.Recent problems with that mean Brussels will run a mile from Ireland-style anomalies.So there would inevitably be a hard trade border. Scotland may not have to join the euro, at least not immediately, but it will have to be fully independent to fulfil the terms of EU accession.It could not be an independent countryit kept the pound and had monetary policy decided by the Bank of England.Nicola Sturgeon is one of the most gted politicians Scotland has ever produced. She is a trained lawyer and has watched the manold dficulties that followed the Brexit vote.She knows that for independence to succeed it would require a huge level of commitment from the Scottish people ndash a commitment that doesnrsquot as yet exist.Evenshe could secure the essential Section  Order from Westminster, therersquos no guarantee that Yes would win.At best, it might be a ided result, perhaps the inverse of , with a narrow victory for Yes. But that would land her with the nightmare of negotiating independence for a ided nation. The Unionist minority would demand a repeat referendum after the separation agreement with the UK is negotiated. Since that was what Nicola Sturgeon called for on Brexit, it would be hard for her to refuse.All these issues crowd into the mind of a politician like the First Minister.She is too aware of the downside, too conscious of the damage of ision and conflict. That is her great political weakness, but it is also her electoral strength.Her aversion to populism and civil disobedience makes it dficult for her to make history. On the other hand, it may be that Scots are happy for her not to ndash at least for now."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-marilyn-monroes-legend-lives","story":"The legend lives on The candle has not burned out on Marilyn Monroersquos legend which endures to such an extent that a bidding war is currently underway for a rare image of the star.Whatrsquos the image Sothebyrsquos auction house in New York is selling what is described as ldquoone of the most revealing and sincere portraits ever taken of Monroe, captured by the late American portrait photographer, Richard Avedon.But there are thousands of pictures of Marilyn This particular image, taken in New York in , is signed by the photographer and is said to have captured her ldquoinner le at a time when she was the worldrsquos biggest star.

While the ways people will vote have not changed, how the campaigns are conducted and covered have been adapted to suit the times.The changed tactics could be seen last week when BBC Scotland held the first of two live televised leadersrsquo debates.The set looked familiar enough, with the five leaders of the larger parties, plus moderator Sarah Smith, standing at podiums.But the podiums were further apart than usual to comply with social distancing rules, and the participants were arranged in a circle, facing each other, instead of a semicircle, looking out to a studio audience.In place of a studio audience was a virtual one dialling in from home. At times, the event looked like one very large Zoom call.: Latest poll good news for Alba PartyHaving a virtual audience instead of the ldquoreal thing was a drawback. Where a live studio audience can applaud, laugh, or scoff when they wish, and be heard doing so, that was not possible here. It is dficult enough to make out what is being said when politicians talk over each other, never mind having the audience do it as well.Scotland is not alone in having a pandemic election. There are local council elections in England, mayoral and London Assembly elections, police and crime commissioner elections in England and Wales, and elections to the Welsh Parliament.Nor is the UK the first country to go to the polls during the pandemic. Last November the Electoral Commission, the independent body which oversees elections in the UK, looked at best practice where to see what lessons could be learned.The initial response to the pandemic had been to postpone elections, the Commission noted. Then the tide began to turn as more was discovered about how the virus spread.Quoting a study by The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, the Commission said at least  countries and territories held elections between February and November , including South Korea and New Zealand. Voting was postponed in , but  elections subsequently took place.The biggest vote took place in the US. While there had been fears that Covid would keep people away from voting stations, a record . million turned up to cast their ballots. The pandemic sent the number of postal votes soaring to almost m, another record.: Expenses watchdog refers concerns to policeMedia coverage was affected by the pandemic. Mr Trump was out and about on the campaign trial, carrying on mass rallies, despite the advice from medics that they risked becoming super-spreader events.In contrast, the Biden campaign held drive-in, socially distanced get-togethers. Crucially, the candidate stayed home for the most part. Had it been any other year that would not have been possible. As it was, opponents accused the Biden camp of using the pandemic to hide their gaffe-prone candidate from public and press scrutiny.In Scotland, voters can hardly complain that about a lack of coverage. In the past few months there has been wall-to-wall reporting on Scottish politics across every medium. If anything, voters are sick of the sight of the same old faces and voices.That is not the same, however, as being informed about policies. But here, little has changed. The information is still out there, whether in leaflets posted through the door, on websites, in newspapers, in party political broadcasts, and where.One development that is new is the ldquovoter  set up by BBC Scotland. In February the corporation issued an open invitation to people who wanted to share their ldquostories, questions and concerns with the broadcaster, the idea being that this would inform output.To ensure the  would be balanced and representative of the electorate, applicants had to saythey were involved in political activism, how they voted in the Scottish independence referendum, the EU referendum, the last Holyrood election, and in the one coming up.ldquoThe  is designed to reflect the broad range of political opinions on many of the issues affecting Scotland, says the corporation.ldquoThat could be based on voting history, views on big issues like independence, as well as representing the ersity of the country based on age, gender, and social demographics as well as where people live.: Proclaimers urge fans to support AlbaThe biggest dference can be seen not in the relationship between parties and voters, but between parties and the press. Campaign launches and party conferences are virtual affairs which go more or less smoothly depending on the technical competence of the organisers. Thus far, Alex Salmond and his Alba Party are providing masterclasses in how not to run such events.If none of the traditional coverage appeals, voters can always turn to Scots Squadrsquos Chief Inspector Miekelson , who has been given an hour-long show on BBC Scotland on April  to interview politicians and ldquotake the temperature of the nation. Mind how you go."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-icon-scottish-nationalism-told-election-can-right","story":"Irsquoll tell you in a bit exactly what he meant by that, but first I thought it might be interesting to look at how much has changed since Mr Hamiltonrsquos hey-day and how much hasnrsquot, because it could predict where we go after the election and whether Mr Hamilton is right. Itrsquos easy, given the SNPrsquos current high point, to forget just how marginal nationalism was  years ago when that little group of students took the stone. But the history of the cause also reveals some familiar patterns: we have been here before.The word Mr Hamilton himself used when I asked him to describe nationalism in the s and s was ldquofringe. In the  election, the SNP attracted . per cent of the vote, andthere were polls on independence, they showed support at % or thereabouts. Indeed, Scottish nationalists were viewed by many as extremists and some of the smaller groups operating on the edges of the movement attracted the interest of Special Branch. By the time we got to the late s, support for home rule looked like it was flatlining.Of course, we know what happened next: Winnie Ewingrsquos victory in the Hamilton by-election in lsquo moved independence away from the fringes and the SNP came to dominate the movement. The party got better organised, it contested more seats, and in the mid-s it claimed that there had been a ten-fold increase in its membership over four years .Anyway, the pattern for nationalism since then has been a series of plateaus as part of a longer climb: at the  election, the SNP won % of the vote then wersquove had the rise and rise since  to the point where the polls now show that ndash even after everything thatrsquos happened to Nicola Sturgeon in the last few months ndash the party will attract pretty much half the vote in the constituencies.Which leaves us with the question of whether the SNPrsquos climb will carry on up, or whether the party ndash not now, not tomorrow but eventually ndash will face a block to their ambitions, which is where the liberator of the Stone of Destiny comes in again. When I asked Mr Hamilton for his views on the election, he said it was obvious it would be success for independence, but it wouldnrsquot make any dference. ldquoWersquore supposed to live in a democracy but we donrsquot, he said, ldquoNo matter how many votes there are, the people who run the United Kingdom will not see us go.Let theatres open, but only when they can be normalSo can he be right  A poll at the weekend predicted success for Alba, giving them six seats, which, together with the SNP, would mean pro-independence parties winning  out of a possible . In other words, Alex Salmond would get the ldquosuper-majority hersquos been talking about and the question then would be whether the UK Government ndash even a government thatrsquos said ldquono as many times as Boris Johnsonrsquos has ndash could carry on refusing.Mr Hamilton clearly thinks it could because, in his view, the people who run the UK ldquowill not see us go. But could they do that without solid grounds, andso, what could the grounds be  Perhaps someone will make the point thatthe pro-independence parties do win  seats, they will have  per cent of the seats for a cause that attracts only fortysomething per cent support from voters, and that would be a very good point to make. You might even say Scotland did not get the parliament it voted for and the UK Government might say that the ldquosuper-majority is no such thing.But a second look at the ebbs and flows of the nationalist cause since Mr Hamilton and his comrades removed the stone reveals another repeating pattern. Bit by bit over the last few months, wersquove seen the relationship between Sturgeon and Salmond move from veiled criticism to open criticism to a scratchy trench-war and part of it centres on a tactical ision: Ms Sturgeon wants to take it easy and build broad support, whereas Mr Salmond wants to push harder, using ldquopeaceful street demonstrations or starting negotiations for independence regardless. Mr Salmond, the great risk-taker, is the bull in the china shop, whereas Ms Sturgeon, by far the better tactician, knows people are going to worry about all the china thatrsquos getting smashed.The point is that this ision between what you might call the moderates and the passionates has always been an issue for the SNP. Famously, in , a small group splintered away from the party because of their concern that the SNP was doing nothing but talk. The party leadership on the other hand urged moderation and warned that the behaviour of a minority in the movement was putting voters off. Pretty much, this is the conversation thatrsquos still going on  years later with Alba.What on earth does the last few days mean for the unionist cause And ndash then and now ndash there have always been people in the nationalist movement who have warned that independence will be a long, long time coming and that there will be many  victories. Bruce Watson, leader of the SNP in the s, told his small annual conference in  that the road to a Scottish Parliament would be a series of ldquopromises, assurances, safeguards, and sometimes cynical rebuffs and thatrsquos pretty much what Mr Hamilton is saying all these years later: he predicts a victory but also a cynical rebuff.Perhaps, then, it is this that should be the lesson of the history of the SNP and the wider movement. There have always been victories and set-backs. There have always been isions. There have always been rebuffs or rejections. Obviously, in , the SNP is considerably closer to its aim than it was when the Stone of Destiny was taken from Westminster Abbey in , but Mr Hamilton still believes the cause will be rebuffed again.

A friend offered us the use of his mower before it went into hibernation, but by the time a dry day arrived, Christmas was almost upon us. Another suggested we get goats.I love the roughness of our grass, which in places is a carpet of buttercups. In others it is pure moss, so airy and light itrsquos like walking on a sponge. You need to watch, though. There are hidden dips, which could twist an ankle, and massive underlying stones on which the grass barely gets a grip.When we first viewed the cottage, in winter, the prospect beyond the gate onto the wooded slopes of the Eildons clinched the deal. Not being gardeners, we did not closely examine it. This large, unflashy rectangle of rugged grass, with silver birch, wild cherry, apple, crab apple and whitebeam trees, felt like an extension of the countryside, and just what we were looking for.Come spring, the forces that had lain dormant throughout snow and ice, keeping the greenery in check, awoke from slumber, and we found ourselves in a jungle of weeds and knee-high meadow. Birdle and wildle were no doubt rejoicing, but while I am all for rediscovering nature, a balance needs to be struck. A film I recently watched with Alan Rickman and Kate Winslet, about th century gardeners the court at Versailles, is called A Little Bit of Chaos. Ours, by contrast, was chaos unchecked.Those who know the dference between a tubor and a bulb might not have been dismayed, but for absolute beginners, we had no idea where to start. Other, obviously, than digging out nettles, rotten tree stumps and so much household debris we wonderedowners in previous centuries simply chucked pots and pipes and glasses out of the window when they were finished, like Greeks after drinking a toast.Last weekend, we found a defunct old clay drainpipe, too embedded to sht without a mechanical digger. It lies there still, planted over with fritillaries, for future generations to ponder.The front of the house was once cobbled, for access to the cart house behind, and long-time residents in Hoolet remember when there was a barn at the back. Next door was a dairy, with a hen-run.I suspect that, until recent decades, the plot behind our cottage was barely reclaimed from the field, which still makes incursions under the gate. Nothing suggests it was ever seriously cultivated, although there are pockets of rich earth, possibly where chickens ndash and perhaps a pig or cow ndash previously roamed.The back of the house is built into rock, which rises in the shape of a sugar-loaf, or ndash surely more likely ndash an iron-age barrow. Archaeologists are welcome to offer an opinion. Shortly after arriving, we had a rockery built into the stone-face, to turn a problem into an asset. Now, however, the steps we have had cut into the slope mark our attempt to impose some order.This outdoor stairway curves enticingly up the grass, but when you reach the top, the extent of what remains to be done is all too clear. How to fashion this wide and rough expanse into a habitable, enticing garden, without losing its rustic charm and turning it into an outpost of suburbia, is the challenge.If you were to believe gardening books or television, itrsquos no big deal. Measure your space, make a scale drawing, and then decide how to proceed. I did the measuring, on a sodden February weekend, when the metal tape measure flapped in the grass asit were alive. Then I made the drawing on graph paper, which brought back bad memories of arithmetic classes. After that, nothing was clearer. If anything, we felt more at sea.Perhaps you need to have worked a garden for most of your le to know where to go from here. It would certainly be hard to be more of an amateur. I realised the depth of my ignorance the other day when about to plant a packet of bulbs. ldquoPointed end upwards the instructions said, but when I shook them out they were like tricorn hats, with points on every side. There was no telling which way was up. In the end, I buried them and hoped nature would eventually tease them to the surface.In the early days, I couldnrsquot even recognise honeysuckle unless it was flowering. We have several plants given to us by neighbours last autumn, whose names I donrsquot know, which have still to come into bloom. It is like throwing a party but not realising who has been invited until you open the door.Yesterday, I discovered one sprouting a pincushion of gentian-blue flowers. The pleasure was out of all proportion to its size, but explains why gardening grows addictive. The thrill of something coming to le before your eyes is extraordinary.As we eye up the scale drawing and look ahead, we know all too well that there is more to learn than we can ever hope to accomplish. Even neighbours whose places could feature in Gardenersrsquo World say itrsquos a matter of trial and error. It is also, plainly, an ever-changing venture, as ideas evolve, fashions change, or ndash in the case of nearby friends ndash a former rose garden is turned into a vegetable plot, to make the most of lockdown.I begin to wonder how I spent my weekends in bygone days, before weeding and pruning, planting and mulching filled the hours. Soon, as the weather warms, and it is possible once more to host friends in the garden, wersquoll be issuing summonses.

Not sufficiently indy-free for opponents of constitutional change, but not full-blooded, vivid, detailed or real enough for everyone .So, letrsquos be honest.

But that will not happen. Not on BBC Scotland anyway. Its first leadersrsquo debate was an unfocused, superficial, sloganencouraging and unrevealing encounter.Meanwhile, the world weariness of some BBC Scotland journalists is increasingly hard to conceal.Last week, one reporter volunteered that she hated election campaigns and was just looking forward to the final results, while another made daring mention of ldquothe I word in an election report asindependence was some unspeakable, embarrassing mad aunt locked in the political attic. So much, so normal.But might Alex Salmond enter the ring and stir things up  The Alba leader is contesting his exclusion from BBC debates but the corporation has successfully resisted many legal challenges to debate line-ups and I doubt it will cave in now.Besides, Mr Salmondrsquos inclusion might not deliver a greater independence focus, given the inevitable distraction and muddying of waters created by two bitter rivals standing on one TV .Furthermore, comments by Anas Sarwar suggest Nicola Sturgeon might not be aloneshe simply refused to appear with the former SNP leader.But letrsquos not be naive. Itrsquos not just the broadcasters ndash it suits every political party to avoid the actual subject of independence as well.Scottish Labour has started its Holyrood campaign on the front foot. It wonrsquot want to risk that impetus by ing deep into issues like low pay, precarious work and brutal benefit regimes which can only be tackled by wrestling power from Westminster. Douglas Ross faces an even bigger challenge.Managing to look awkward atop a large Army vehicle last week, every appearance reminds voters that while the MP for Moray is physically larger than Ruth Davidson, the new Scottish Conservative leader is nowhere near as comfortable in his own skin or politically bullet-proof.So, Douglas Ross will be happy to keep making swipes at ldquoseparation without being drawn into real debate about the benefits of the union.Willie Rennie would have to lay aside the publicity stunts with giant deckchairs and badgers to become the unionrsquos most passionate advocate and while the Greens must persuade Yessers they really back independence after acquiring more profile for their stance on gender rights, they also have to put clear green water between themselves and other indy parties on the list.So, with relatively few bites of the media cherry, the party will probably major on the green recovery. Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon has a record to defend and a wariness of half-launching any independence campaign without final, settled positions on currency, deficits and borders.Still, she may have to tryAlex Salmond lets rip at his policy launch tomorrow. Of course, the Alba tail cannot wag the SNP dog.But since Ms Sturgeon has had five post-Brexit years to devise new independence strategies, it may seem strange to votersshe doesnrsquot leap at the chance to unveil them.

Hell, theyrsquore even facing questions about planning applications and secret meetings with billionaire developers.The egregiousness of the Toriesrsquo graft and their success in selling it to English voters by describing it as ldquotaking back control has been a gt to the SNP.It has provided them with the classic cover story for maintaining endless power without scaring the horses and doing anything radical. Even last weekrsquos fancy pledge about providing social and affordable housing didnrsquot make it to the weekend before disintegrating.The Tories, in becoming a cartoon version of themselves, permitted the SNP to point south and say: ldquoWe must free ourselves from this cesspit.

In general, Irsquod like things to work on the assumption that the powers-that-be should have to produce good reasons why we shouldnrsquot be free to do something, rather than that we should have to provide evidence that they have permitted us to do whatever it is. ANDREW McKIE:The government is dangerously authoritarian, but the public may be even worse.Irsquom well aware that there is a contrary, net-curtain-twitching attitude, equally prevalent in the British character. These are the people who say things like:yoursquove got nothing to hide, yoursquove got nothing to fear, and who would like to report their neighbours to the police for painting their front door the wrong colour.This lot have been much in evidence during the past year: when restrictions were reintroduced at the end of last year, an amazing  per cent of people in one poll were of the view that they didnrsquot go far enough.But whether yoursquore of a relatively liberal disposition, or an interfering busybody, it would have been dficult to imagine,  months ago, that a passport would be required to buy a pint, get your hair cut, go to the football, or nip down to the shops. Yet that is where we are, with politicians and commentators ndash some of them with previously impeccable libertarian credentials ndash seriously discussing whether a new category of discrimination should be created and recognised by the law. One which might, on some suggestions, require you to disclose and prove your medical history to employers, theatre ushers, restaurateurs and travel companies.There are plenty of reasons why this proposal should be seen as illiberal, unfairly isive and ineffectual ndash not least because it should be transparently obvious to a man with half an eye that it is all those things. But the fact that it would be self-evident in normal circumstances doesnrsquot mean that, in the current climate, itrsquos as open-and-shut a case as ndash one would hope ndash almost everyone would find it. ANDREW McKIE:House of Lords: Calling for reform is as traditional a part of British le as Trooping the ColourItrsquos clear that, like it or not, some scheme where people will have to disclose their vaccination status in order to travel abroad is almost certain. And, until vaccination in dferent countries reaches similar levels, the case for it is not hard to see. A slightly more problematic but still entirely logical argument could be made for some employers ndash the NHS or care homes would be the most obvious ndash to insist that any workers dealing with the most vulnerable should be subject to testing or proof of immunisation. Some workersmay want assurances that their working conditions ndash dealing with crowds, for example ndash are safe, and see passports as a means to that end.There are, in my view, rather more reasons to oppose it: it discriminates against those who cannot have the vaccine for medical reasons, the young, who mostly havenrsquot even had the chance to have it, it gives too much power to the government, it would be expensive and probably ineffective. It would certainly be easy to subvert: as I happens, Irsquom already taking the two tests a week the Prime Minister was pushing for yesterday , but theyrsquore self-reported. Even leaving aside the whole question of  positives and negatives, and assuming the self-administered test is flawless, the confirmatory text from the NHS saying that Irsquom negative is merely telling me what Irsquove just told them.Whichever side of the fence you come down on, though ndash like so many other issues over the past year ndash a question about restrictions that would usually be unthinkable anywhere other than a police state has become a legitimate topic for debate. And, though Irsquod oppose vaccine passports, I can see why.Itrsquos a dferent question from whether you think the circumstances actually justy the measures. It is at least conceivable that they could. It is also a dferent question from whether you trust the government , or think that the Tories, or the SNP, have dangerously authoritarian instincts. I think one can easily believe some in both parties do without veering into hyperbolic accusationsthat fully-fledged fascism is on the agenda.But all the same, the thing that we ndash and those in parliament ndash need to keep firmly in mind is that the question of a curtailment of liberties of this sort would normally be unthinkable. If it is thinkable now, it is only because the state has armed itself with powers that it ought never to have, except in times of national emergency.There has to be the suspicion ndash evenyou think Boris Johnsonrsquos instincts, or Nicola Sturgeonrsquos, are fundamentally benign, or at least not akin to Mussolinirsquos ndash that some politicians and public officials are getting rather too comfortable with restricting our freedoms or, worse, that the fact they simply find it more convenient to do so is coming to seem justication enough.Even the most gung-ho proponent of lockdowns, vaccine passes, continuous testing and draconian travel bans should be on guard against allowing such an attitude to develop. And though many will think the vaccine deniers, the extreme libertarians or the straightforwardly selfish partygoers are irresponsible and dangerous, the fact is that their position, or at least their right to hold it, is the normal one, and one that we should all be aiming toto as soon as possible.

To support his argument he cites such facts as Slovakia is in the centre of Europe, has a car industry, lower wages, provides cheap migrant labour and. And you know what hellip. drum roll hellip.he is absolutely right. ldquoScotland is not Slovakia.But then again, Slovakia is not Scotland, or have I missed Slovak whisky, its green energy potential, its world-class universities out of all proportion to its population, its world-renowned food and drink, one of the most recognisable tourism brands anywhere in the world  Oh, and by the way, being in central Europe is not necessarily an advantage ndash much better to be closer to western Europe.However, having attempted to diminish the signicance of the recent LSE report, Mr Russellrsquos argument is notable for the omission of one important fact, and indeed the central tenet of the report, that the ending of a single state to form two independent states need not be the trauma that Mr Russell and his unionist colleagues so cheerfully forecast in the event of Scottish independence.On July,  the Slovak Parliament declared the independence of the Slovak nation and six days later the political leaders of the two parts of Czechoslovakia agreed to dissolve the union. Czechoslovakia was formally dissolved on December  that year. Job done.Moreover, the immediate aftermath was without conflict as well. For instance, neither side claimed to be the successor state, in contrast to the UK in , which made clear that this was its intentionthere was a Yes vote. Rather than create barriers both sides agreed a customs union and freedom of movement . By , the Slovak economy was within  per cent of the Czech GDP per capita, having been % less than it immediately prior to dissolution.In short Mr Russellrsquos argument is really only informative for what it does not say, since what it does say is superfluous to the LSE report and unrelated to the future of an independent Scotland, for, as he says himself ,ldquoScotland is not Slovakia.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.* JINGS, crivens, help ma boab!

But why is it that after  years in power this is only finally dawning upon her During the period of SNP governments we have seen a succession of mediocre justice secretaries a well-administered police service being chopped up in the interests of costs and efficiency and a prosecution service starved of funds and reform. These are the bedrock of the inadequacies in our justice system today and with taxpayers money being spent largely on Covid recovery and independence, there will be precious little left to bring about the much-needed reform.Its amazing that when an election approaches, politicians have their \"Eureka\" moments and then quietly forget about things once the election has passed.Bob MacDougall, Kippen.WE MUST CHANGE VOTING SYSTEMBRIAN Taylors account of the role played by the Additional Member voting system in Holyrood politics is interesting ndash not least for the entertaining historical anecdotes . Although Jack McConnell may have agreed in  that the electoral system used for Holyrood elections \"had been devised specically to prevent the SNP from taking power with a minority of the popular vote, AMS was sold as a system that would prevent any party achieving such dominance. Indeed, the concern of many at the time was that the Labour Party might dominate. As Mr Taylor shows, AMS does not achieve what it was supposed to achieve and every successive election brings more failings.Fast forward to the  Holyrood election, which he doesnt mention. Three parties put up manestos which opted for a change in the election system to the Single Transferable Vote. In fact, these three constituted a majority for that view, one might say a ldquosupermajority for STV, to coin a phrase. STV could have been implemented, as the Scotland Act  had conferred power on the Scottish Parliament to decide its own system. Instead we now have a confused situation with pop-up parties, unknown agendas and complete uncertainty about who could be elected.Thomas GF Gray, Lenzie.LOST IN THE COMMUNICATIONTODAY I received an election \"communication\" from the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party. It was a colourful A card mainly in shades of mauve, yellow and red. Only a single X in blue. It mentioned Indyref independence  times and the SNP seven times. It attacked the SNP and Scottish Labour vis-a-vis their stances on Indyref independence but mentioned no other policies at all, neither its own nor its opponents. Its very dficult to engage with peoplethey wont \"communicate\" their position on any bread and butter policies. I suppose that must be the rationale behind the election \"communication\".Rachel Martin, Musselburgh.* POLITICIANS sound bites are remarkable for their concision. Alex Salmonds \"part exaggeration, part fabrication\" in relation to accusations resonates with Henry McLeishs \"a muddle, not a fiddle\" regarding expenses claims.At the risk of upsetting many readers, I also think of Boris Johnsons \"Lets get Brexit done\".David Miller, Milngavie.Read more: We would suffer a sorry fate as a small nation in the EU"},{"url":null,"title":"uzma-mir-sewell-report-laughable-ordinary-people-not-politicians-already-defeating-racism","story":"Added to that was the dficulty that the judge ndash in this case the UK Prime Minister ndash had kicked off the competition by saying he wanted to \"change the narrative so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination.\" I mean,you wanted to win the coveted gold cup itrsquos probably best to give him what he wanted. Right The narrative Boris Johnson wanted to change is that the system ndash whether itrsquos in education, employment, health ndash is rigged against people from ethnic minorities in Britain.:Uzma Mir: Arrival of my bright blue vaccination envelope brought joy...and despairClearly, the first step is to ignore most of those who have experienced and contributed to the narrative over the last  years ndash first generation Asian and Caribbean immigrants, the victims of the Windrush scandal, those impacted by the legacies of slavery and empire, those affected by stop and search and racial profiling. Or Black mothers who are nine times more likely to die during childbirth than their White counterparts, the victims of the Grenfell tragedy, victims of racist attacks and abuse, the disproportionate numbers of ethnic minorities who have died as a result of the Covid- pandemic, and ethnic minority teachers and doctors who have repeatedly failed to get promotion.Their stories are the ones the media apparently want us to know about ndash the failures that show Britain in a negative light. Instead, we must use data to point to the success stories only.In the report Scotland, and uses data predominantly from England and Wales we are hit with a barrage of data some of which seems to indicate better outcomes for some ethnic groups than others.Most ethnic minorities do relatively well in getting into higher education including those from poorer backgrounds but when it comes to getting graduate jobs Indian, Chinese and White British earn above poundk whilst Black Caribbean and Pakistani Bangladeshi graduates earn less.The report looks for explanations with the naivety of an -year old ndash young people from poorer backgroundsneed to get better careers advice some Black and Pakistani Bangladeshi British young people went to low-tarf universities Indian and Chinese British come from a more stable family structure.But in fact, after applying for a job all ethnic minorities have to work harder to get a call-back. The report notes that ethnic minority job applicantshave to write on average . letters for every  letter a white applicant writes to get a call-back.Why  Hmm, the reports not sure. Next example, please. Try the field of medicine: In  almost half of all doctors in the NHS were from an ethnic minority, yet % of consultants are white. Searching for explanations for this disparity the report is silent, finally scunnered by having run out of reasons for this inequity. Data, as we all know, can be manipulated and moulded to prove or disprove the hypothesis, but to ignore it, is a new level of gas-lighting.And whilst we are rewriting the present day narrative to prove that institutionalised racism no longer exists, the report seems to want to reimagine the past too.The recommendation that we teach schoolchildren that enslaved Africans changed themselves culturally to be more like the British, to offer a positive view of slavery and its affect on the African diaspora, actually sickens me.In the foreword, the chair Dr Tony Sewell wrote: \"There is a new story about the Caribbean experience which speaks to the slave period not only being about profit and suffering but how culturally African people transformed themselves into a re-modelled African Britain.\"Like some sort of reality makeover show we are meant to forget that the slave trade made commodities of human beings, chewed them up and spat them out. This is one narrative that no amount of spin can ever change, and as people of the world we cannot allow this sort of revisionism, out of respect for the thousands who perished at the hands of the Atlantic Slave trade.These are the facts that lsquospeak torsquo not only ethnic minorities but increasingly to the majority in this country. Since last summer and the death of George Floyd in the US and the subsequent Black Lives Matter demonstrations, ordinary people have moved forward to start to change the system. The commission is too late to stop that.:Meghan and Harry: Im a mixed race mum ndash I understand how a pregnant Meghan must have feltBlack, Asian and Minority Ethnic employees talk about being lsquoheardrsquo in their organisations and places of work for the first time, there has been more discussion, more representation in some areas of employment, in adverts, on TV, in film, and even in Scottish football clubs.It is these people who will change the narrative ndash organically and from a place of fairness rather than governments of any persuasion who want to alter our realities. Because the truth is that most of us want to see a post-racial society where every member is pulled up to be equal and treated with equal respect, their stories and histories are given equal value, and they are equally rewarded for their work which instils confidence and loyalty in us all.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

By  it may be extinct.Yet Rev Fair is determined the church can be reborn so long as it becomes a servant of its communities, a useful muster point for those who want to fulfill local needs.It has been striking throughout the pandemic to see how local churches - of all denominations - have become central to peoples desire to act, their need to feel some way in control during a relentlessly unpredictable time.Rev Fair said Glasgow Church of Scotland churches have handed out more than , food parcels over the past year.The Gurdwara near my flat has been feeding hot meals to those in need of sustenance and company throughout the crisis, a massive feat of organisation carried out by and for those of many faiths and none.Mosques nearby have done similar, so too has a local Jewish group.A Catholic organisation in Glasgow told me it was the only homelessness service providing face to face support throughout lockdown.Thats not to say secular groups have achieved more or less, but that people who would describe themselves as of no faith have joined with religious groups in order to feel part of something useful in a way that was more unusual pre-pandemic.Of course, all this is the ordinary business of faith organisations. Religious groups run foodbanks every week of the year. They were out overnight on the streets with homeless people long before the pandemic.Its not uncommon to hear non-believers be utterly scathing of those with religious faith. But I often wonder whether they think the gaps would be pluggedthey successfully scorned everyone out of their beliefs. The motivation of faith is demonstrably useful. Yes, people do good for others without needing a belief in a God to motivate them but would they do so in such numbers Last year the country saw an increased desire for community and for charitable action, spurred on by crisis. Yet already it feels as though this motivation is waning, as the crisis passes.Facebook groups set up to support local communities experience dwindling engagement, the bursts of volunteers are lagging.At the same time, there is an increase in reports of chronic loneliness, poor mental health and a sense that we have no collective way to process the grief of the past year.There was a programme on Radio  the other week where the loved ones of a French gendarme who died protecting others in a terrorist attack spoke of the aftermath of his death.Each, including his widow, framed how their faith helped them find meaning and continue to experience joy, despite this terrible loss.I felt quite envious, listening to them, of the purity of their convictions in comparison to my fly-by-night ideals.Raised in the church, despite having no real belief in God, I still take comfort from the rituals and routines. It is soothing to be in the company of others without judgement.Secular society is missing a space where all ages and backgrounds, a true cross section, come together. There is no obvious place to join and talk about shared experience, moral questions or community with a wide mix of people.Rev Fair mentions finding a new use for church buildings. He suggests having them open at am on Saturday mornings, for those spilling out of nightclubs to spill into.In response to talk of the death of the high street, suggestions are made that town centres reinvent themselves as spaces for social enterprises and community hubs, in place of shops.If thats the direction of travel, church buildings fit perfectly as part of it.If a vision of radical change is on the cards for the Church of Scotland then now, in a time of healing from a debilitating crisis, is the time to achieve it.That blend of faithful and secular coming together for common community good should be invigorated with churches a place for communion, in both a spiritual and an atheist sense."},{"url":null,"title":"call-cycle-lanes-pandemic-sees-huge-surge-bike-use","story":"Campaigners are now calling for increased investment in infrastructure such as designated cycle lanes to sustain the increase and encourage more people swap their cars for commuting by bike.: Cycling in Glasgow city centre soars by %According to data gathered by Cycling Scotlands nationwide network of  automatic cycle counters, there were  per cent more cycling journeys recorded overall between March   and March  , compared to the same period in -.In Girvan, Callander and Dunoon, the number of bike rides rose by more than % over the year.The sharpest spikes Scotland-wide were seen in the months immediately after lockdown, with % and % more cycle journeys recorded respectively in April and May , before gradually reducing to a year-on-year increase of % by December.In January this year, amid adverse weather conditions, the number of cycle journeys being taken was actually down by % compared to January , before the pandemic.However, the figures rebounded with the cycle counters recording % more bike journeys in February this year and a % upturn during the three weeks from March  to  last month.: Edinburgh and Glasgow react to new cycle lanesCycling Scotland said the figures were a \"bright spot in a horrendous year\".The charitys chief executive Keith Irving said: \"Cycling has a key role to play in people getting exercise and fresh air, managing the ongoing pressure on our transport system and, crucially, tackling the global climate emergency we face.\"Were delighted at the massive increase in cycling and its vital we see it continue and expand.\"Keith Irving, chief executive Cycling ScotlandHe added: \"To get even more people cycling, we need to invest more in infrastructure so people feel safe to cycle.\"We need more dedicated cycle lanes, separated from vehicles and pedestrians.

We will have to respond to that.ldquoIn terms of domestic vaccine passports, I think there are still many questions that remain unanswered.ldquoThere will be those in society, particularly the younger, who have not had the opportunity to get a vaccine yet and are well down the list of the priorities for the vaccines, and there will be a small minority of people who for legitimate reasons donrsquot take up the vaccine.ldquoAnd I worry that we get into a two-tier system that does not allow fairness for everyone to come through this.ldquoAs we see the restrictions start to ease off...I hope we donrsquot need to go down the route of formal passports for people to get back to le as they knew it before this pandemic hit.Askedthere would be a Commons vote on the issue, the Moray MPsaid: ldquoThe whips havenrsquot told us yettherersquos going to be a vote.\"It would obviously be determined on what wersquore being asked to vote for -itrsquos a vote for a trial, is it a vote for international passports, or is one for domestic passports.\"With all these things, Irsquoll look at the evidence.ldquoIrsquom willing to look at all the points put forward.

Some have suggested it will add in a lot of extra work, whether there will be issues with genuine Covid passports and forgeries.ldquoSo some within the industry believe that as the most vulnerable in society get protected, and restrictions start to ease, is there a need to have domestic Covid passports.ldquoI think there are a number of questions that remain unanswered.ldquoThe trials may prove a lot of the concerns are unfounded.ldquoIrsquom not trying to sugarcoat this. I have reservations about the process, about how they would work and about a two-tier system that they may introduce.ldquoHopefully,we continue with the vaccine roll-out, continue to see restrictions lted, they wonrsquot be needed because wersquoll be back to a form of normality sooner rather than later."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"April ,  at : pmThere have been no new COVID- cases in Orkney since Friday, April , according to new figures released by the Scottish Government.

If you do see someone in dficulty in the water or at the coast call  and ask for the Coastguard.”Speaking on behalf of Kirkwall leboat, Graham Campbell said: “We understand that many people will have been missing trips to the coast and will be eager for a change of scene or activity.#However, we are really asking the public for their help.  Our team of dedicated volunteers have remained on call throughout the pandemic but, in order to attend a shout, we must break physical distancing instructions, putting ourselves and our families at risk.#We also cannot be everywhere at once,we see a sudden increase in people visiting the coast and local beaches our volunteer run service could struggle to meet demand.

Wersquore going to see what we can do to make things as flexible and as affordable as possible. vw,vw,px, px\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson A Downing Street paper published on Monday stated that it is not known whether foreign leisure travel will be permitted from May , which is the earliest date it could resume for people in England under the Prime Ministerrsquos road map for easing restrictions.Mr Johnson said: ldquoI do want to see international travel start up again. We have to be realistic. A lot of the destinations that we want to go to at the moment are suffering a new wave of the illness, of Covid, as we know.ldquoWe canrsquot do it immediately, but that doesnrsquot mean that wersquove given up on May .ldquoWe will be saying as much as we can, as soon as we can, about international travel.ldquoI know how impatient people are to book their holidaysthey possibly can but I think we just have to be prudent at this stage.Under the traffic light system, countries will be rated ldquogreen, ldquoamber and ldquored based on a range of factors, including the proportion of their population which has been vaccinated, rates of infection, emerging new iants and their access to reliable scientic data and genomic sequencing.Mr Lundgren told BBC Breakfast mandatory tests for people ing from ldquogreen countries ldquoshould not be needed.He said: ldquoI donrsquot think that is fair, I donrsquot think itrsquos right, and I donrsquot think it is necessarily established from a medical and scientic point of view that is the right thing to do.ldquoIf they choose, however, to go down that route to have the tests in place, it should be the same type of testing, the lateral flow testing, which is much cheaper, more accessible, that is being used to open up the domestic sector as an example. vw,vw,px, px\"Polymerase chain reactiontests are swab tests that are processed in a laboratory, and cost around pound each in the UK for private customers.This is ldquoway over and above what the cost is of an average easyJet fare, Mr Lundgren explained.Requiring passengers to pay for PCR tests ldquowouldnrsquot open up international travel for everyone, he said.Rapid tests, or lateral flow device tests, are swab tests that give results in  minutes or less, without the need for processing in a laboratory.Everyone in England will have free access to those tests twice a week from Friday.Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss told reporters that people should be able tofrom ldquogreen countries without the need for tests ldquowhen it is safe to do so.He added: ldquoWe canrsquot have a prohibitively expensive testing system that puts businesses, people and families off travelling.ldquoPassengers travelling to and from lsquogreenrsquo countries should be able to do so freely, without testing or quarantine at all, and vaccinated passengers travelling to and from lsquoamberrsquo countries should not face testing or quarantine.Mr Weiss said destinations that should be on the ldquogreen list from May  include the US, Israel and the Caribbean.The US is ldquovaccinating over three million people per day, Israel is ldquothe worldrsquos leading vaccinated country, and the Caribbean ldquohas done an awesome job throughout this pandemic of keeping things under control, he explained at a joint press conference with Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye and British Airways boss Sean Doyle.Mr Holland-Kaye said the United Arab Emirates could be included as ldquothey also have very high levels of vaccination.He went on: ldquoThere are plenty of long-haul countries which have low Covid levels, and many of them have high vaccination levels also.Mr Doyle cited recent research by consultancy York Aviation which suggested that a ldquolost summer of international travel would cost the UK economy pound. billion in a decrease in trade and pound billion in a cut in tourism.Travel to and from the US is ldquovitally important for all of us here in the UK, he said, adding: ldquoNo air link to the US until September will cost the UK an additional pound. billion. Thatrsquos pound million per day.ldquoA tremendous lost opportunitywe donrsquot act now and quickly.copy -. This site is part of Newsquests audited local newspaper network. A Gannett Company.

Accordingly, I have decided to entrust him with the task of doing so.mdash Reuven RivlinApril , This is not an easy decision on a moral and ethical basis, in my mind.

Mr Netanyahursquos fate, giving Israelrsquos longest-serving premier a fresh chance to try to salvage his career.Mr Netanyahu now has up to six weeks to try to cobble together a coalition.If he fails, Mr Rivlin could give another party leader the opportunity to try to form a government mdash or the country could be plunged into yet another election.Mr Netanyahu has the most support,  seats, in Israelrsquos Knesset.But that is still short of a  seats needed for a majority.He is likely to use his powers of persuasion to try to lure a number of opponents, including close former aides who have

I would like to congratulate Kyleakin Playpark project on their award, theirs is an important project and will support people now and in the future when they can physically come back together to make great things happen in their community.”The final piece in the funding jigsaw came from a Highland Council ward discretionary grant of £,.Local councillor John Finlayson said: “Myself and fellow members were really impressed by the fundraising drive to date and the fact that through ious channels, almost £, of the funding was secured before the ward discretionary was turned to.“The fundraising to date made the decision to support the final piece in the jigsaw very easy and members were keen to point out that this project highlights how community drive and partnership working, that includes a clear strategic vision, can achieve positive outcomes.”James MacQueen Building Contractor’s Limited gave £, and a developers’ contribution from Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association of £, was made linked to the construction of the new houses.A further £, came through the Kyleakin Gala MOWI Scotland donated £, Kyleakin and Kylerhea Community Council gave £, online crowdfunding brought in £, while £ was raised through the Balmacara SPAR.It is hoped that the park will be completed by late summertime."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/LAMB-SALES-19-2.jpg","title":"the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIt is far from a new problem and one that very much sits hand in hand with a long-standing wider issue in relation to crofting development and productivity – lack of use and neglect.You don’t need to go far to come across overgrown and rank crofts, where fences have rotted away and the ground has been covered in a blanket of coarse, dead vegetation. It is a depressingly all-too familiar sight.“Stagnation” was the term Mr MacKinnon used, and he was spot on.As lives become ever more disconnected from the land, it’s quite understandable why people no longer have the inclination, or time, particularly when there is no great financial . But how it must frustrate those desperate to work the land to see all these crofts going to waste.Survey after survey has demonstrated a huge interest from people wanting to get a foot on the ladder, but they can’t because the traditional avenue of family inheritance is not open to them.The croft tenancies that do come on the market go for astronomical sums, way beyond the reach of young families and completely out of kilter with agricultural potential.And this is the problem, the reason that so many people hold onto non-working crofts is because they can see the pound signs they can see what it might fetch in terms of its housing potential, with estate agents only too happy to downplay the fact that every croft tenancy sale and every de-crofting application has to be approved by the Crofting Commission. It’s not proved too much of an impediment in the past.In fairness to the commission, they have made improvements. As much as the law enables, they do now try and prevent housing speculation – although one recent case in Lochalsh suggests there may be still some way to go. And they have at least made the right noises about dealing with neglect, which has prompted an increase in formal sub-leases and tenancy transfers.But as Mr MacKinnon noted, it is dficult for them to really stamp their authority without the proper resources.So an impasse remains, young families are unable to get access to land while countless crofts go to waste.But there is a solution, evenit will make for an uncomfortable journey: remove the ability to trade tenancies on the open market and at the same time get rid of the right to buy a croft. At a stroke, those motivated purely for monetarywill disappear their incentive gone. Then arm the commission with the necessary resources to properly tackle neglect —rather than the current practice of gentle encouragement without force — and those who have crofts but can’t do the work will have to quickly find a solution. Step forward new entrants.Granted, the opposition to such an approach will likely be signicant. Denying people the opportunity to do with an asset what they please will be seen as anti-libertarian, a curb on personal freedom, and you can easily predict the outrage.But the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you please. You are part of a unique system of land tenure which was established nearly  years ago to keep people and communities alive. That is still very much of relevance today. Denying those fortunate enough to have crofts from lining their own pockets and ensuring everyone lives up to their duties doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation in that context.It is expected that, Covid recovery depending, the new term of the Scottish Parliament willto the matter of crofting reformand there is an opportunity here for a proper radical approach which addresses the needs of crofting today but, crucially, with the principles of old at its heart.It will require politicians and leaders of strength and conviction who are able to make a compelling case in the face of undoubted opposition, who can the see the vision that a new, radical approach will bring and who can reject pressure from all sorts of vested interests. The trouble is: there is precious little evidence of that calibre of inidual in Scotland’s political landscape of today.IT SEEMS like only yesterday I was talking about preparing for the winter and here we are with spring on the horizon. Soon the digital clock in the van will be at the right time again. I have more reason than usual to hope for a good lambing. The scanning results were on the disappointing side,  empty out of  and  sets of twins giving an overall percentage of around . Not a disaster by any means, particularly in this part of the world, but my own lowest tally ever, as usually I’m looking at somewhere around the  to  per cent mark.I suspect an underlying issue with fluke at tupping time. Fasciola hepaticais a tiny mud snail which is ingested through grazing and attacks the liver. It thrives in wet conditions and is re in Scotland.There are routine treatments, but it’s now recognised that the parasite is developing a resistance to some of the products on the market. As a result of that, the advice is to constantly use dferent ones and I probably wasn’t as meticulous in this as I should have been, although I know that others too have had increased problems with fluke in the early part of the winter – and it was horrendously wet in November through to December.So the dry, hard frost of a couple of weeks ago was a godsend and it was on such a bracing but beautul morning that we gathered for the scanning, the ground underfoot like uneven concrete. You could have gotten away with your trainers.Once the work was completeI linked up my iPhone with the scanner and a detailed breakdown of the results popped up on the screen. A couple of pings later and it was out in the ether, all the way out to the North Sea where it was downloaded by someone not able to be in attendance to view his own results almost instantaneously.It was a lovely symbiosis of tradition and technology, though goodness knows what the bodachs of yesteryear would have made of it all."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/John_Purser-202030713-edited.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais pure escapism among the fenian","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThat may explain why story-telling and mythology were so highly prized.

You could say she was pursuing the romantic Celtic dream, but with Father Allan and the people of Eriskay she found it, and it was no more a dream than was she herself.We should be immensely grateful to her. Her style of writing may seem slightly arch to some today, but none other than Padraic Colum was happy to write the foreword to her book, full of praise for her writing skills.She was a kind of predecessor of Margaret Fay Shaw, that most redoubtable of ladies, made of Pittsburgh steel, chain-smoking and with a bourbon to hand and her beloved piano just across the room.

Daniel Kane found herself in Malawi - the fth poorest nation in the world. Malawi, with a population of almost million and only a handful of ventilators and very little PPE, was totally unprepared for the pandemic. Charlotte assisted in the initial response to the first surge of the coronavirus as it spread throughout Malawi. Currently, however, a second and more deadly wave is gripping the country with devastating consequences. Charlotte said: “There are ten times more cases than during the first wave and a projected exponential increase in the infection rate. “Access to hospitals and modern health care is extremely limited. Many covid- patients are being treated in temporary wards in carparks with oxygen cylinders and . “There is no ability to give patients ventilatory support and take them into intensive care. Frontline healthcare workers risk their lives every day without adequate PPE and basic essentials such as hand gel.”Another huge contrast with the UK is that it may be some time before poorer countries like Malawi can get the vaccine. Here in the UK, the vaccine rollout has been a massive success with every person eligible for a free vaccination on the NHS. In poorer countries it will take much longer even for the vaccine to reach frontline health workers and the most vulnerable. The “Economist” reckons that it will be  at least before there is widespread vaccine roll out. “This means that Malawians have at least two years to get through before there is effective vaccine cover. As the vaccine rolls out in advanced economies and many of us are starting to see a glimmer of hope that normality willsoon, the story in Malawi couldn’t be more dferent,” says Charlotte.For health systems which are already woefully under-resourced, dealing with a second wave and a new strain of COVID- is a monumental challenge. Hospitals and clinics are operating without the basics to protect their staff and patients. Basic levels of PPE and hand gels are in very short supply. Without this support fragile health systems will be decimated of their most precious resource at this time – healthcare workers as many are at home sick with COVID- or sadly dying. This comes at a time when hospitals are buckling under pressure and desperately need health workers to be able to work.Charlotte now works as a doctor in Liverpool where the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine has launched Bump It Forward campaign to help bring PPE and vaccines to Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe in an attempt to redress this massive health inequality. The fund raising campaign actually came about as the result of a dream.A Christian friend of Prof Melita Gordon, who works in Malawi fulltime as part of the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, dreamt about how she was to receive her vaccine free of charge and an idea emerged to ‘pay forwar’d the cost of that doseage to help people in countries who did not yet have vaccines. It was a very direct, personal idea that people in the UK who have had a vaccine get it for free while the people in Malawi don’t. People love the idea of the BumpitForward campaign as it provides the opportunity to give back the cost of the vaccine in the order of pound. which they get it for free to help protect healthcare workers in Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe until the vaccine reaches them and save lives.Dr. Kane says she would love to see a local response to the campaign after her experience at the Mulanje District Hospital.Charlotte says: “The hospital is doing a great job, providing quality, safe and dignied care in extremely dficult circumstances.“Just like in the UK, they have had staff shortages related to staff testing positive for COVID which has made things all the more dficult. The senior nurses have designed a protocol to make best use of reusable gowns and are very grateful to receive the PPE donation. “I worked at Mulanje for the first six months of  and they have been brilliantly supportive partners in MLW-led research into reducing deaths from sepsis and HIV associated TB, so it is a pleasure to be able to support our partners when they are in need of PPE at this time. #Bumpitforward is a wonderful campaign which I couldn’t recommend highly enough.Give the equivalent of your Covid- vaccine to protect frontline staff in African countries who will have to wait for theirs. You can help keep them safe by donating the equivalent cost of your vaccine, to protect them until they can get theirs. There has already been a huge response to the Bump It Forward campaign and it continues to grow! It has now raised over pound,.

Professor Gabriel Scally said movement in and out of affected areas should be banned, while specialist teams should carry out mass testing, contact tracing and vaccination to stop a further Covid- surge. Prof Scally, a member of the Independent Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , has also raised concerns over plans to introduce mass home testing. Everyone in England will be given access to two rapid coronavirus tests a week from Friday in a plan the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said will help suppress any outbreaks as lockdown eases. The lateral flow kits, which can provide results in around half an hour, will be available for free at testing sites, pharmacies and through the post. The Department of Health in Northern Ireland has not said whether it plans to follow suit, although lateral flow tests are being used for the workplace testing programme here. Prof Scally said: These tests have limited value as they are only really % effective at picking up positive cases, so I wouldn#t want people making really important decisions from the results. Picking up % of positive cases is better than % and they#re useful for workplace testing, such as in meat processing plants, but I certainly wouldn#t think it was safe to visit a vulnerable relative or friendI had a negative result. It just wouldn#t be safe, I would be worried about these tests giving  reassurance to people who potentially have the virus and it changes their behaviour. Prof Scally said he is optimistic that Northern Ireland can escape a further deadly Covid- surge but he stressed that health authorities must ensure a robust test, trace and isolate system is in place and called for the introduction of automatic testing for all close contacts. He also recommended a specialist response to future clusters. It comes as official figures suggest theof pupils to school has not resulted in a spike of cases. Health bosses had warned they expected a rise in the number of Covid- infections after the phasedof pupils to class, which began on March . According to Department of Health statistics, there were  positive cases in people up to  years old between March  and . There were  cases diagnosed in the seven-day period between March  and April . All schoolchildren are due toto class next Monday. Prof Scally said it is likely there will be an increase in cases as a result of pupils going back to school but he believes it will not be a signicant rise. The vaccination programme has made a huge dference, he said. There has been a lot of talk about another wave but I can#t really see it happening, although it is a possibilityrelaxations happen too quickly. There are going to be clusters here and there and it is essential the authorities respond quickly. What they should be doing is stopping movement in and out of areas where there are clusters, teams should be sent in to test everything that moves and do really good contact tracing. They should also vaccinate everyone who hasn#t yet been vaccinated. That would be the logical thing to do. According to figures released yesterday, two further Covid- related deaths have been recorded in Northern Ireland and  people had tested positive over the previous  hours. More detailed information will be available tomorrow.Belfast Most ReadMLA Gerry Kelly#s Easter Rising tweet sparks unionist furyNorthern Ireland riots: UDA warned business owners to close early or risk being attacked NI driver in #drunken# US horror smashDeath of Declan Ryan in Fermanagh jetski incident #devastating#, says Arlene FosterA quarter of Irish politicians want to keep tricolour in potential united IrelandTop VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second nightPlayPetrol bombs thrown in Cloughfern as rioting continues for a third night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPetrol bombs thrown during disturbances in Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey Latest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Three further deaths and  new cases reportedNorthern Ireland hospitality chief urges Executive to engage on reopening of industryNI couples glad they got married despite Covid restrictionsGAA pundit Joe Brolly part of talks to set up vaccine manufacturing in Republic in IrelandRoadmap: Boris Johnson to reopen key sectors but Stormont is #stuck in lockdown mud#Latest from Belfast Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Three further deaths and  new cases reportedNorthern Ireland riots: Nine more police officers injured during loyalist violence as Naomi Long says politicians #fanned flames#Belfast crane driver hijacked car before breaking in to two houses, court told‘Inflammatory’ report could put lives of ethnic minorities ‘at further risk’Vaccine rollout still on target despite slowdown, No  insists,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

One animal welfare charity said this may be due to the pandemic, as fewer dog wardens have been on the streets.Karen Matthews of Almost Home NI said owners needed to ensure their pets are microchipped and their details are up-to-date to prevent strays being put down.This will mean that,a stray dog is picked up, it will be reunited with its owner or at least have a fair chance of getting back home, she said.That#s incredibly important at the minute with the amount of dog thefts that have been going on, it#s vital those details are up-to-date. The other thing with stray dogs that is really important for people to know is to check every single pound in Northern Irelandyour dog goes missing.  Belfast Beat Newsletter Receive the big stories from across Belfast directly to your inbox  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      We had a dog last week, for instance, that someone picked up in Newcastle as a stray. They were coming back from a walk in the Mournes, and they brought it back to Lisburn. So that dog would have ended up in the dog pound in Lisburn and, being realistic,you#re from Newcastle, you#re not going to think to ring the dog pound in Lisburn looking for your dog. That kind of thing happens all the time.Ms Matthews said the pandemic has presented challenges for rescue centres.There has been an increase in cases involving stray dogs for us, because during the pandemic many dog wardens stopped picking up stray dogs, particularly during the first lockdown, she said.A lot of councils didn#t send their wardens out to pick up stray dogs off the street, so it was left to the rescue centres. Even at weekends and out-of-hours, we#ve always had stray dogs in because many vets are closed at the weekends and such. Some dog wardens have out-of-hours services, but not a lot of them.The Dogs Trust charity said it is saddened that councils are still in the unfortunate position of having to put stray dogs to sleepthey haven#t been reunited with their owners and no other suitable home has been found.While the number of stray dogs has continued to decrease in the last few years, we want this to remain at zero and would remind dog owners of the continued importance of ensuring they have an up-to-date microchip and licence for their dog, as this can help reunite dogs with their owners should they go missing, it said.Dogs Trust never puts a healthy dog down and we work with local authorities across the UK to find homes for as many stray dogs as possible. We don#t believe that owners set out to abandon their dogs or give them up for adoption however one of the most common reasons for dogs coming into our care is due to unwanted behaviours at home. Our Change the Tale campaign seeks to provide owners with information and resources that can help themthey are struggling with their dog and give them the tools they need to overcome these issues.Belfast Most ReadMLA Gerry Kelly#s Easter Rising tweet sparks unionist furyNorthern Ireland riots: UDA warned business owners to close early or risk being attacked NI driver in #drunken# US horror smashDeath of Declan Ryan in Fermanagh jetski incident #devastating#, says Arlene FosterA quarter of Irish politicians want to keep tricolour in potential united IrelandTop VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second nightPlayPetrol bombs thrown in Cloughfern as rioting continues for a third night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPetrol bombs thrown during disturbances in Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey Latest Belfast BeatVigil: Community pays tribute to little Kaitlin McCoubrey-FullertonBelfast city centre retail staff told toto work #in preparation for April  opening#Belfast councillors vote to hike their allowances in spite of oppositionChief Constable Simon Byrne welcomes external probe into PSNI#s handling of Storey funeralLatest from Belfast Weather has yet to spring into action with more cooler temperatures on the wayCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Three further deaths and  new cases reportedNorthern Ireland riots: Nine more police officers injured during loyalist violence as Naomi Long says politicians #fanned flames#Belfast crane driver hijacked car before breaking in to two houses, court told‘Inflammatory’ report could put lives of ethnic minorities ‘at further risk’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We did as many touristy things as we could.Ms Haigh#s most recent visit could not have been more dferent - as the new Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.Then, social distancing rather than socialising was the order of the day, as the Labour MP met, among others, Troubles victims and survivors at the Wave Trauma Centre in Belfast.There, the people who welcomed her included the centre#s coordinator Alan McBride, whose we Sharon died in the  Shankill bombing, and Jenner McNern, a survivor of the  Abercorn Bar atrocity.Louise spent time listening and learning but, frustratingly for her, she hasn#t been in close contact with anyone locally-based since that day last July.Consequently, she is looking forward to the end of lockdown - and finally meeting the likes of First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill in person, rather than on Zoom.I have regular virtual meetings with both Arlene and Michelle, both of whom I respect enormously, but I couldn#t tell you how tall either of them are, she joked.Attempting to do her job remotely has, however, been no laughing matter for singleton Louise, whose maternal grandmother hails from Cork.Of her Westminster colleagues from here, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood is a good friend and she gets on very well with the DUP#s parliamentary leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, but obviously there hasn#t been so much personal interaction with Stormont politicians.It#s actually been incredibly frustrating holding this brief during lockdown, said the Yorkshire woman, who lives alone in her native Sheffield - except for her dog Milo - but shares a property in London with an MP colleague and a couple of other friends in what she calls a strange split le.In the first lockdown I had my best friend and her seven-year-old living with me but since they moved out, I#ve been on my own, she said.This last lockdown has been the most dficult because the weather#s been horrendous and it#s felt almost interminable.Describing herself as a very sociable person, she said she has really missed my family and friends.Some assumptions frustrated me when we went into lockdown, she added.People were assuming Members of Parliament were inflicting rules on everyone  because we were with our families and protected that way, but lockdown has been really dficult for those of us who live alone.She hasn#t ventured near a travel agent just yet but is hoping to visit a good friend in Cornwall soon and more importantly, get over to Northern Ireland in the next couple of weeks.Louise, who became the youngest Labour MP when she was elected as member for Sheffield Heeley in , is also the first female Northern Ireland Shadow Secretary since the late Marjorie #Mo# Mowlam - one of my political heroes - in the s.Mo was unlike any SoS or shadow SoS who had come before, said Louise of her predecessor, a key architect of the Good Friday Belfast Agreement who, tragically, died in , aged just .She had loads of personality and although she took the brief very seriously, she didn#t take people very seriously.It#s people that really drive me, in the way that motivated and inspired Mo as well.There are too many politicians who aren#t motivated by people, and don#t feel comfortable being around people.They feel more comfortable in locked offices thinking about policy rather than being driven by the challenges people face in their everyday lives.Louise, who studied politics at the University of Nottingham, initially toyed with a career in criminal law - she did a Masters degree in Law after her politics degree - like her father Richard . Mum Juanita , is a probate solicitor, and her brother Philis a sports journalist.Politics, however, ran through the family.My uncle was a striking coal miner in the s, while my auntie moved to South Africa and worked for the international Red Cross, fighting against apartheid in the s and s, she said.My grandma also fled from the Spanish civil war in the early th century.I had a very left-wing economics teacher at school who made me see where my views fitted into a party political framework, and that#s why I joined Labour when I was .Louise#s first job after graduation was working for MP Graham Allen and that totally opened my eyes to a whole world that I#d never known before.Being an MP herself - she is still one of the youngest people on the famous green benches of the Commons - still daunts Louise.I look around when I#m in there and think #what am I doing here , she admitted.I still have massive imposter syndrome you can#t help think of all the incredible people who#ve gone before you. But it#s been an extraordinary learning curve over the last six years.Despite the self-effacement, Ms Haigh is regarded as one of the most talented and astute Labour MPs, which is one of the reasons why she is in Sir Keir Starmer#s shadow cabinet.It is her job to keep her Conservative opposite number, Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, on his toes, and has done so on many occasions from the dispatch box.But she backs Mr Lewis#s attempts to override the devolved government here and push through abortion legislation, which was passed in  when the Stormont Executive was suspended but has yet to be officially implemented.It#s a great shame that it#s come to this, she said.Ultimately the UK government has human rights obligations, and the situation in Northern Ireland was found to be in breach of those obligations.Women are still facing the completely unacceptable situation of having to travel to access safe legal abortion so, as regrettable as it is, I support the government in what they#re doing.It is a dferent story, however, when it comes to that other major bone of contention, the Northern Ireland Protocol.Last month the UK moved to unilaterally extend the grace periods for Irish Sea border checks - which the European Union regards as a breach of international law.With Northern Ireland remaining a part of the EU#s single market post-Brexit, and goods and products arriving here from GB having to undergo EU import procedures, the initial grace period was meant to end on March . Mr Lewis and his cabinet colleagues decided otherwise.Theyhave repeatedly put their narrow political interests above the interests of Northern Ireland and we#re seeing the consequences of that play out now, she said.Northern Ireland is not a priority for them like it was for the last Labour government, and the Tories# recklessness and political games, particularly with the Good Friday Agreement, are resulting in the threat of instability now.She added: Labour knew how potentially upsetting Brexit could be to the delicate balance of identities in Northern Ireland.I totally accept what a challenge this is to unionism and loyalism and to their identity and there wasn#t nearly enough consideration given to what their reaction would be. Even in January, Brandon Lewis was still denying there was any Irish Sea border - and that dishonesty has worsened the anger and made things a lot more dficult to repair.Ms Haigh#s former party leader Jeremy Corbyn made no secret of his support for a united Ireland, so where does she stand I don#t think it#s a forgone conclusion, she said.The constitutional question will, however, come up over coming years but there are still a signicant number of people who have to be persuaded of the merits of a united Ireland.For me, the most important thing is making Northern Ireland work for the people there. As Mo Mowlam said, it#s the real lives of people that needs changing and there are huge public policy issues that need addressing right now, from the health service and mental health service to legacy issues.If the current opinion polls are anything to go by, Louise won#t get an opportunity to emulate Mo Mowlam and become a Labour #SoS# here.Despite the many mistakes made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his colleagues since the Covid- pandemic struck, the Tories - who have a huge parliamentary majority - remain comfortably ahead of the main opposition party.And Mr Starmer, who has just passed one year as Labour leader, is facing criticism from many of his own backbenchers who accuse him of sitting on the fence too often and abstaining, rather than voting against, the Government on key issues such as the Covid restrictions tier system.I#m desperate to hold onto it until the next election at the very least, said Louise, who conceded that the #vaccine bounce# has helped the Conservatives enormously over the past few months.The government has made enormous mistakes and had massive failures - the highest death rate in Europe and the worst economic impact of any developed economy in the world, she said.They have failed on every metric, but they are enjoying the success of the vaccine.The battle for the next election, however, is going to be about recovery and rebuilding our country. The Tories are the government that weakened our economy and our public services so drastically ahead of the coronavirus and that#s why we had such a disastrous response to it.Ironically, Ms Haigh has personally been helping the NHS vaccination programme her rivals are claiming credit for.A GP askedI would come down and help at one of the local vaccination centres, she explained.They were giving out the Pfizer vaccine to a lot of older people so I was helping them with mobility issues.A lot of them were getting their second vaccine and crying out #freedom#. It was so positive.Despite the criticism of Ms Haigh#s boss, he has acted decisively to rid Labour of the accusations of anti-Semitism which blighted the Corbyn era.Louise admitted the party still had work to do in rebuilding trust with the Jewish community but have already made enormous strides with that.Ithas been a real stain on our party and one I#m deeply ashamed of, she said.On a lighter note, is it true that the Mark Darcy character played by Colin Firth in the Brigid Jones#s Diary series is based on the Labour leader Confirming that author Helen Fielding later denied that, Louise added: I had a massive crush on Colin Firth... I#m afraid I don#t have a crush on Keir Starmer.Belfast Most ReadMLA Gerry Kelly#s Easter Rising tweet sparks unionist furySouth East Antrim UDA warned business owners to close early or risk being attacked NI driver in #drunken# US horror smashDeath of Declan Ryan in Fermanagh jetski incident #devastating#, says Arlene FosterA quarter of Irish politicians want to keep tricolour in potential united IrelandTop VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second nightPlayPetrol bombs thrown in Cloughfern as rioting continues for a third night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPetrol bombs thrown during disturbances in Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey Latest Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Three further deaths and  new cases reportedPSNI confirm nine more officers injured during violent disorder as Naomi Long says politicians #fanned flames#Man hijacked car before breaking in to two houses, court toldProposal for Stormont Assembly to be recalled over loyalist violenceTributes paid to #extremely caring# man Alan Hope who died in beauty spot fallLatest from Belfast Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Three further deaths and  new cases reportedPSNI confirm nine more officers injured during violent disorder as Naomi Long says politicians #fanned flames#Man hijacked car before breaking in to two houses, court toldSpain’s PM vows to ‘vaccinate without respite’ as he steps up pace of jabsValencia hit back after Juan Cala denies racially abusing Mouctar Diakhaby,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While the liberation of Ireland has not yet been achieved, British manipulation coupled with the treachery of former republicans has upheld the partition of Ireland. For the solution, the army must look in radical terms to attacking the cause of Ireland#s problems.Almost  years since the partition of Ireland, it#s clear it has failed and those who attempt to uphold it will fail.Meanwhile, members of Saoradh, the New IRA#s alleged political wing, held a wreath-laying ceremony in Derry City Cemetery yesterday with around  people present.A planned march for the event to mark the th anniversary of the Easter Rising was cancelled.The ceremony passed off without police intervention. DUP MLA Gary Middleton said he would be raising the issue with the PSNI.Saoradh national executive member Stephen Murney said: Saoradh are reminded that men and women were incarcerated in British and  county jails for standing by the Republic proclaimed in .Mr Murney claimed Saoradh grew more confident daily in our political analysis and position. He said: The British and  county establishments must fear our message and our analysis as we continue to bear the wrath of MI-led harassment across the country. Our social media pages face regular censorship, yet we are getting our message out there and it is resonating with people. Mr Murney added: We hope to pass the unrepentant revolutionary republican flame onto the next generation.We remember that in , it was so-called dissidents and radicals within the broader nationalist movement who led the charge and pushed the revolutionary agenda forward to rise and strike a blow for liberty.We are proud to inherit the title dissident in the Irish context.The Good Friday Agreement was not the end of Irish history. There has been and always will be dissenting voices until the socialist republic that so many gave so much for is achieved.Belfast Most ReadMLA Gerry Kelly#s Easter Rising tweet sparks unionist furyNorthern Ireland riots: UDA warned business owners to close early or risk being attacked NI driver in #drunken# US horror smashDeath of Declan Ryan in Fermanagh jetski incident #devastating#, says Arlene FosterA quarter of Irish politicians want to keep tricolour in potential united IrelandTop VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second nightPlayPetrol bombs thrown in Cloughfern as rioting continues for a third night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPetrol bombs thrown during disturbances in Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey Latest Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Three further deaths and  new cases reportedNorthern Ireland riots: Nine more police officers injured during loyalist violence as Naomi Long says politicians #fanned flames#Man hijacked car before breaking in to two houses, court toldProposal for Stormont Assembly to be recalled over loyalist violenceTributes paid to #extremely caring# man Alan Hope who died in beauty spot fallLatest from Belfast Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Three further deaths and  new cases reportedNorthern Ireland riots: Nine more police officers injured during loyalist violence as Naomi Long says politicians #fanned flames#Man hijacked car before breaking in to two houses, court toldWhat are the plans for Covid vaccine passports Fear factor might lead to Spurs leaking late goals says sport performance coach,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Then, much of the UK, including Northern Ireland, enjoyed spring weather that was on par to the summer as y spells of bright, clear sunshine went on for weeks.Looking to next week, the Met Office said the forecast for the British Isles is “looking very cold and wintry, especially for northern areas”.“Uncertainty remains in how far south this very cold air will extended. Within this a mixture of sunny spells and showers remains likely. Some of these outbreaks may be wintry, especially in the north,” said the spokesperson.“Furthermore, strong winds are expected for northern parts at first, though easing later. After this, conditions are likely to turn drier and more settled for most, with the greatest likelihood of unsettled spells in the northwest.”Belfast Most ReadMLA Gerry Kelly#s Easter Rising tweet sparks unionist furyNorthern Ireland riots: UDA warned business owners to close early or risk being attacked NI driver in #drunken# US horror smashDeath of Declan Ryan in Fermanagh jetski incident #devastating#, says Arlene FosterA quarter of Irish politicians want to keep tricolour in potential united IrelandTop VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second nightPlayPetrol bombs thrown in Cloughfern as rioting continues for a third night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPetrol bombs thrown during disturbances in Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey Latest Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Three further deaths and  new cases reportedNorthern Ireland riots: Nine more police officers injured during loyalist violence as Naomi Long says politicians #fanned flames#Belfast crane driver hijacked car before breaking in to two houses, court toldProposal for Stormont Assembly to be recalled over loyalist violenceLatest from Belfast Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Three further deaths and  new cases reportedNorthern Ireland riots: Nine more police officers injured during loyalist violence as Naomi Long says politicians #fanned flames#Belfast crane driver hijacked car before breaking in to two houses, court told‘Inflammatory’ report could put lives of ethnic minorities ‘at further risk’Vaccine rollout still on target despite slowdown, No  insists,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Accordingly, I have decided to entrust him with the task of doing so.— Reuven RivlinApril , This is not an easy decision on a moral and ethical basis, in my mind. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the State of Israel is not to be taken for granted. And I fear for my country.— Reuven RivlinApril , But I am doing what is required of me as President of the State of Israel, according to the law and to the ruling of the court, and realizing the will of the sovereign â the Israeli people.— Reuven RivlinApril , “I have decided to entrust him with the task,” Mr Rivlin said from Jerusalem.“This is not an easy decision on a moral and ethical basis,” he added.“The state of Israel is not to be taken for granted.“And I fear for my country.”With that, Mr Rivlin nudged forward the twin dramas over the country’s future and Mr Netanyahu’s fate, giving Israel’s longest-serving premier a fresh chance to try to salvage his career.Mr Netanyahu now has up to six weeks to try to cobble together a coalition.If he fails, Mr Rivlin could give another party leader the opportunity to try to form a government — or the country could be plunged into yet another election.Mr Netanyahu has the most support,  seats, in Israel’s Knesset.But that is still short of a  seats needed for a majority.He is likely to use his powers of persuasion to try to lure a number of opponents, including close former aides who have vowed never to serve under him again, with generous offers of powerful government ministries or legislative committees.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news cd .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_facaa-bc-d-ba-ce_embedded

Institute, a Jerusalem think tank.Mr Netanyahu will also likely need the support of the Yamina, a right-wing party led by a former ally turned rival.Yamina’s leader, Naftali Bennett, has had a strained relationship with Mr Netanyahu in recent years.He also been cool to an alliance with Arab parties.Mr Bennett called for formation of a “stable, right-wing” government on Tuesday and promised to negotiate in “good faith”.But he did not commit to backing Mr Netanyahu.Opposition leader Yair Lapid, head of the centrist Yesh Atid party, acknowledged that the law left Mr Rivlin “no choice,” but in the same tweet denounced the development as “a shameful disgrace that tarnishes Israel”.Mr Lapid has offered an alternative: a power-sharing arrangement with Bennett that would see the two men rotate into the prime minister’s job.They are expected to hold intense negotiations in the coming weeks.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news afd .ece AUTOCROP w

might form the next coalition government In a sign of the challenge ahead of Mr Netanyahu, about  protesters hoisted LGBT pride flags and a mock submarine — a reference to a graft scandal involving the purchase of German subs — in a noisy demonstration that could be heard as officials began the swearing-in festivities of the new parliament in an outdoor plaza.Leaders of the ultranationalist Religious Zionism party, which backs Mr Netanyahu, are openly homophobic.Mr Netanyahu’s coalition talks will be conducted in the shadow of his corruption trial.While a ruling is months or even years away, the proceedings are expected to take place up to three days a week, an embarrassing and time-consuming distraction that will shadow Mr Netanyahu’s appeals to his rivals.In court, he faces fraud, breach of trust and bribery charges in three separate cases.Proceedings resumed on Tuesday, though the premier did not appear in court.A key witness on Monday cast Mr Netanyahu as an image-obsessed leader who forced a prominent news site to help his family and smear his opponents.Mr Netanyahu denies all charges and in an nationally televised address accused prosecutors of persecuting him in an effort to drive him out of office.“This is what a coup attempt looks like,” he said.This week’s court proceedings focused on the most serious case against Mr Netanyahu — in which he is accused of promoting regulations that delivered hundreds of millions of dollars in profits to the Bezeq telecom company in exchange for positive coverage on the firm’s popular news site, Walla.Ilan Yeshua, Walla’s former chief editor, described a system in which Bezeq’s owners, Shaul and Iris Elovitch, repeatedly pressured him to publish favourable things about Mr Netanyahu and smear the prime minister’s rivals.The explanation he was given by the couple “That’s what the prime minister wanted,” he said.PAMost ReadMLA Gerry Kelly#s Easter Rising tweet sparks unionist furyNorthern Ireland

There is not a girl woman anywhere who doesnt like a piece of jewellery or an aromatic fragrance. You could include a few men in that, too! Among them are two young Derry girls who love all things glittery and sparkly – and a nice fragrance – so much so, they have used their time during Covid- lockdown to start up their own fragrance business. Sisters Mia, , and Bella Doherty, , from Cornshell Fields in the Ballyarnett of the city, named their enterprise Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella- a combination of their names – and after almost a year of research, trials and checking out regulations, they have their enterprise up and running. googletag.cmd.push At the minute, they are making wax melts of ious fragrances and shapes along with room sprays to match the wax melts smells. They are also currently looking into other products as well. Mia, who attends St Marys College, said they began researching soon after the Covid- restrictions were introduced in March last year. She added: “We undertook online courses in candle-making tohelp our wee idea become a reality. “We tried out dferenttypes of soya wax andfragrances with our family being thetesters, much to their delight for a goodfew months. “We wanted to be % happywith our product before we decidedthey were ready for purchase.So the launch of Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella began last month. googletag.cmd.push “We are both currentlyusing our mum’s kitchen but she doesn’tmind as we clean up after ourselves and her house always smells solovely for her. “Also, by law, we have to follow certain regulations, so have to ensure CIP labels are made for every fragranceoil and then bepresently packaged. This can all take a lot of timebut we really love being creative and by adding glitter and colour and trying out dferent designs makes our wax melts stand out compared to others.Having nice packaging and how they are presented is very important to us “We make wax melts by melting soya wax and adding fragrancesoils and pour into moulds, although this sounds very straight forwardthere is temperature taking anda few step-by-step instructions that need to be adhered toin order to maintain a good quality product that will last.”     Despite the success and the enjoyment of making fragrances, Mia said she was looking forward to going back to school. “St Mary’sis a fantastic school and I love getting up to go to school every morning.” She admitted she was a bit concerned about how much catching up she will have to do but said she was sure the teachers would put everyone at ease when they were all back in the classroom. “We definitely missed schoola lot,especiallynot seeing our friends was dficult but starting this business has helpedkeep us occupied and easeanyboredom. “Learning our craft and keeping upwithschoolwork has made the wholeCovidsituation fly in for us. Weare so busy at the minutewith orders for delivery that our mum had to help out as well. She is able to help at the minute as her business is currently closed due toCovid- restric- tions.She was a great help at the start as she was able to guide us in the right direction - we have even roped dad into helping by doing the deliveries.” She added: “I hope we go back to normality as I like the hands on physical activities at school like technology and science experiments.” Bella, who ed to P at Steelstown Primary School on Monday last, said despite the enjoying of producing Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella products, school work was her priority. “I was a bit nervous about ingto school but it was great. I have a new teacher and she is really lovely. It was great seeing all my friends as well. This is my last year in primary school so I am really happy to be getting backto see everyone before I have to make the transition to secondary school.” Bella said they had been inundated with very positive reviews for their range of products. “Everyone seems to love the product going by the lovely messages we receive.Customers wish us every success andfor more orders so this makes us very happy. “When we are back at school full-time and not able to commitour time as much to the business as school is the priority, my aunties are willing to help out to keep us well stocked up with our products. “The people in our cityand beyondhave been really supportive inshopping local, it feels good to know we’re doing something right.” The girls mother, Maria, is understandably so proud of her two girls, being the owner of Miabella beauty salon next to the car wash on Racecourse Road in Shantallow which has been closed for nine months of the past year. She said: “If there’s one thing I can take from lockdownis that I work too much and the girls missed me, so spending quality time and helping them out with their wax melts was amazing. I’ve learned so much from them and how much of a work ethicis instilled into them, “I am so proud of them both andhow they have juggled both school work and their newly established business. “They both are managing perfectly so farand I can go back to work and know they are perfectly capable of staying on top of orders. “As their mum, though, I will keep on top of the social mediato ensure their safety - their page is linked to my phone so I can keep them safe.” Maria conceded she has found lockdown extremely dficultat times. She added: “I really miss my clients, as a lot of them have become friends over the years. It’s always good to catch up with each other.I’m so looking forward to seeing each and every single one of them when I canalthough trying to fit everyone in will prove to be a dficult task. “Somehow, I’ll man- ageshould I work night and day to get you all beautied again.I don’t like to disappoint anyone when they look for appointments, my clients are lovely and are very understanding.” So Chanel, Jimmy Choo and Gucci, take note of the name - Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sometimes I will call the captains, separately, at half-time before the teams are going in for the break. It could be something as simple as warning them to stop chopping. Theyll appreciate it more that you went to them in their role as captain.” Looking at refereeing as a whole, Micky puts himself in the position of the player. What would they want from the man in the middle  “I wanted someone to be consistent, whether it is right or wrong for both teams. I want them to keep up with play and explainas opposed to just blowing the whistle and pointing. If you ask them the score, they are not ignoring you.” There also, he feels, needs to be an openness to error and the possibility of a referee making a mistake. Others may see as a sign of weakness. “I would completely disagree,” Quigg states. “If you can be honest and open with a player, thats all they want back. “I am not sayingIm right and youre wrong. I am saying that from my point of view, it looks like, for example, a pick off the ground. From my angle, it looked like a pick off the ground. I am going to stick with it.” ***  Two years ago a torn cruciate ended the footballing career of Desertmartins Paddy Devlin at the age of . As someone with a deep interest and an avid watcher of games, getting back involved was a must. Tied in was a fascination for the rules. In an age when black card ref became the common shot at grounds across the country, Devlin would often evaluate it. “Sometimes it wouldnt be close to the right call,” he adds. “I was always very interested in  the game as a whole. I would have followed football...Id have nearly gone to every championship and league match, as many as I could.” Played right, the advanced mark, which he finds interesting has helped the game. Two minutes into a conversation is enough to convince you of Devlins constant thirst for knowledge. And improvement. In a similar fashion to the player wanting to constantly evolve. From refereeing his first game in an U Féile na nÓg game, he was on the line for Greenloughs win over Steelstown in last years intermediate final. “I was working along with Poloand Declan OConnor that day,” Devlin adds. “”Those boys have a lot of experience and seeing them dealing with pressure. Every day is a learning day.” Every day is a school day and every game is a fresh script. Use of a rule may pop up for the first time in a few games and its time for another refresher. Its all about preparation. “You have two teams who have trained all year for a championship match, you dont want to let yourself or anybody down. You try to do it to the best of your ability,” stresses Devlin, who referees two minor championship games last season and Greenlough Us final win over St Patricks. LEARNING Criticism can crush or polish you. Paddy filters through it, but chooses the latter. “Some of it is constructive, some of it is unfair,” he says. “You evaluate it and have a good team of umpires around you that you trust, who are not going to lie to you and tell you that you did well, when you really didnt. “You want to get as much information to try and improve every game. Sometimes you are going to be wrong, you just have to take it on the chin and move on.” Watching senior championship games was part of the learning curve and reaching out for help. No question was too trivial. It was all learning. “Listen to the older hands and every one of them has always guided me, taking time to show me things to keep myself right,” was Devlins advice to anyone who finds themselves in his shoes two years ago, ready to step on the refereeing ladder. In terms of getting into the zone for a game, he echoes Micky Quigg. The background noise is irrelevant. And there is enjoyment. “Its about keeping your head and staying calm,you are doing it properly and watching the game, anything  is just like a humming noise.” PREPARATION Devlins knee reconstruction ruled out the twisting, turning and contact required for five-a-side football to keep himself ticking over. He now turns to walking and running. His  and km runs keep his engine primed enough to put him in the best place on the pitch to make a call. His job as a lorry driver for GO fuel sees him away early in the morning and home late in the evening, with just enough turnaround for a quick bite before darting out to a game. Having everything organised the day before avoids any late panic. “The worst thing is rushing into a game unprepared. I like to be there in time and warmed up and show the players, I am taking this seriously,” he points out. “There is nothing as bad looking as a referee landing late and unprepared, it gets the peoples backs up right away.” On the pitch, its about remaining calm and settling into a game early, while getting on the players side. “The game is about the two teams, not the man in the middle,” Devlin states. “I tell them I am here to let them play, and I dont want to blow this whistle.” He will look for a bit of reasoning and concedes that mistakes will be made, but his bug bear is high and rash tackling. It is uncalled for in his opinion. “At underage, a lot of it comes down to coaching and people need to remember you have to tackle the ball,” explains Paddy, who also refers to the Give Respect, Get Respect logo on referees clothing. Paddy Devlin looking across his home pitch in Desertmartin. “If you give respect, youll get respect back,” he stresses. There has to be a balance between too much authority and having control over a game. The referee shouldnt be in the spotlight. “At the end of the game,nobody knew who refereed that match, it is a job well done in my eyes,” Devlin continues. Thats real success. He was keen to stress the point of only being able to make a decision on what he can see. In a championship, there will be umpires and linesmen. But on the average Sunday when he follows the play, he is on his own and someone gets struck off the ball. His hands are tied. “I dont think people fully understand that,” he says. “You have to make the best decision on what you see. Thats the point...its on what you see.” For someone with an interest in the game, Paddy sees getting involved as a referee as a step forward. “It is a good way of getting fit and getting to meet dferent people,” he sums up. “It reflects your personality and how you can keep calm. There are a lot of stressful situations and it is all about coming out on top of them.”\",\"keywords\":\"Derry GAA,Referee,Micky Quigg,Paddy Devlin,IN\",\"articleSection\":\"GAA\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"With news of ato club activities, thoughts turn to the season ahead.

Reporter: Michael McMullan::  Apr   addthis, With news of ato club activities, thoughts turn to the season ahead. In a special feature this week Michael McMullan looks at those who take up the whistle. Football referee Paddy Devlin and hurling whistler Micky Quigg talk about their experiences.So you think you can do better  Put your whistle where your mouth is. Those words struck a chord with Micky Quigg. As Derry GAAs Facebook post came calling for new referees, Quigg thought he could do better. The Swatragh man followed it up with a short email to Sean Curran, who was looking after referees at the time, and hes been there since. After taking up the whistle in , a spell in the Big Apple as New York GAAs Hurling Development Officer saw him referee his first senior county final three years later. Tucked away in the Bronx, under the shadow of Manhattan College and the passing trains, Ulster took on Tipperary in the decider, with Dublins Danny Sutclfe and Clare goal machine Shane ODonnell in action. googletag.cmd.push Micky Quigg taking change of the New York county final in . “I also did the semi-final and TJ Reid was playing for one of the teams, so that was pretty cool,” Quigg states. Hurling and refereeing have been kind to him. In summary, Quigg sees the glass as more than half full in relation to what is often perceived as the toughest gig in sport. When a call needs to be made, the eyes will be locked on the referee. Two sets of players, supporters and management teams. “Its not even the decision,” Quigg explains. “Its the split second you have to make it and the pressure that comes with it.” googletag.cmd.push There are more good days than bad. Enjoyment comes from the rapport fostered from the relationships with players and managers alike. Provided a referee has the right personality there is craic to be had. Its not all a bed of roses. There is the verbal and sometimes physical abuse attached to the role. Many forget there is a person behind every referee. A family, a job and the challenges le throws at them. “Thats a fair point,” Quigg accepts. “It is to do with the GAA community as a whole, we are a very passionate group.” In his coaching and playing days, he would offer his handshake and a word of thanks in the direction of the referee regardless of his agreement with all the decisions.     “If I am in the middle of pitch and am focussed on the game, I dont hear it,” Quigg states of any abuse hurled in a referees direction. “They are just chancing their arm. The majority of the conversations to me have always been respectful.” Referees, in Quiggs opinion, are only as strong as the advice they get. And with every game, comes new learning. He cites Eamonn Hasson, Tarlach Conway, Owen Elliott, Eddie and Alan Nash on those he can bend the ear of. “If there is a game where Im not sure how that went, Id pick up the phone and give them a call,” Quigg points out. “A lot of boys have been good to me down through the years. With refereeing in general and Derry GAA theyll have your back and look out for you. Advice, a hand doing a line or umpire or whatever it may be.” UMPIRES Quigg took a real liking to refereeing and with the fitness gained comes travelling around the county extends as a social aspect many others gain from sport. He is thankful for his pool of umpires. His brother John Joe, Neil McAllister, Brian Oacuteg Corbett, Francis McEldowney, Rory McGurk and the Mullan brothers – Cathal and Dominic. “You need people you can trust and point out what everyone has to look out for,” Micky explains and is thankful whichever four he calls on will be on his channel. A trusted set of eyes when an off the ball incident needs a decision. “Those boys are always there for me...and we have some craic on Sunday mornings,” adds Quigg of the early Sunday morning trips to a windy Garvaghey to some corner of Antrim. “Get a group of your mates to do umpire for you,” comes his advice for anyone thinking of taking up the whistle. “When you get the first couple of games under you, youll start to enjoy it. They do say refereeing is a hard job, but generally the majority of people have an appreciation for you at the end of a game oryou see them through the county during the week.” Having another referee casting their opinion on his performance was a help to Quigg early on. Like a player wanting to reach the top level, there is no substitute for watching. And learning. “Look what the referees at the top level are doing. How they deal with decisions, communicate with players and go back to their umpires.” One of the roles of any captain is to take the toss. It gives the referee a chance to get his message into the respective pre-game huddles. The simple message that is easily carried. A popular one is a warning against dissent. “Id always have it in my head before a game what I am going to tell the captains,” Quigg states. “I tell them that it needs to go back to the team andit isnt, its on them. “Youll miss a pick-up, youll miss a score and I will make an odd mistake, but I will be consistent and I will keep up with the play,” Quigg explains of his message. “If I call a freecaptains will often ask me what they need to do dferently. Sometimes I will call the captains, separately, at half-time before the teams are going in for the break. It could be something as simple as warning them to stop chopping. Theyll appreciate it more that you went to them in their role as captain.” Looking at refereeing as a whole, Micky puts himself in the position of the player. What would they want from the man in the middle  “I wanted someone to be consistent, whether it is right or wrong for both teams. I want them to keep up with play and explainas opposed to just blowing the whistle and pointing. If you ask them the score, they are not ignoring you.” There also, he feels, needs to be an openness to error and the possibility of a referee making a mistake. Others may see as a sign of weakness. “I would completely disagree,” Quigg states. “If you can be honest and open with a player, thats all they want back. “I am not sayingIm right and youre wrong. I am saying that from my point of view, it looks like, for example, a pick off the ground. From my angle, it looked like a pick off the ground. I am going to stick with it.” *** Two years ago a torn cruciate ended the footballing career of Desertmartins Paddy Devlin at the age of . As someone with a deep interest and an avid watcher of games, getting back involved was a must. Tied in was a fascination for the rules. In an age when black card ref became the common shot at grounds across the country, Devlin would often evaluate it. “Sometimes it wouldnt be close to the right call,” he adds. “I was always very interested in the game as a whole. I would have followed football...Id have nearly gone to every championship and league match, as many as I could.” Played right, the advanced mark, which he finds interesting has helped the game. Two minutes into a conversation is enough to convince you of Devlins constant thirst for knowledge. And improvement. In a similar fashion to the player wanting to constantly evolve. From refereeing his first game in an U Feacuteile na nOacuteg game, he was on the line for Greenloughs win over Steelstown in last years intermediate final. “I was working along with Poloand Declan OConnor that day,” Devlin adds. “”Those boys have a lot of experience and seeing them dealing with pressure. Every day is a learning day.” Every day is a school day and every game is a fresh script. Use of a rule may pop up for the first time in a few games and its time for another refresher. Its all about preparation. “You have two teams who have trained all year for a championship match, you dont want to let yourself or anybody down. You try to do it to the best of your ability,” stresses Devlin, who referees two minor championship games last season and Greenlough Us final win over St Patricks. LEARNING Criticism can crush or polish you. Paddy filters through it, but chooses the latter. “Some of it is constructive, some of it is unfair,” he says. “You evaluate it and have a good team of umpires around you that you trust, who are not going to lie to you and tell you that you did well, when you really didnt. “You want to get as much information to try and improve every game. Sometimes you are going to be wrong, you just have to take it on the chin and move on.” Watching senior championship games was part of the learning curve and reaching out for help. No question was too trivial. It was all learning. “Listen to the older hands and every one of them has always guided me, taking time to show me things to keep myself right,” was Devlins advice to anyone who finds themselves in his shoes two years ago, ready to step on the refereeing ladder. In terms of getting into the zone for a game, he echoes Micky Quigg. The background noise is irrelevant. And there is enjoyment. “Its about keeping your head and staying calm,you are doing it properly and watching the game, anything  is just like a humming noise.” PREPARATION Devlins knee reconstruction ruled out the twisting, turning and contact required for five-a-side football to keep himself ticking over. He now turns to walking and running. His  and km runs keep his engine primed enough to put him in the best place on the pitch to make a call. His job as a lorry driver for GO fuel sees him away early in the morning and home late in the evening, with just enough turnaround for a quick bite before darting out to a game.

Then it was straight into another MacRory and Hogan campaign before we hooked up with the minor hurlers.” Joe McGurk had Screen man Pat Joe McKenna with him and later added his brother Collie to the setup. It was a rush to get a team pulled together after the  Hogan Cup final needed a replay for Maghera to see of St Jarlaths. It took a goal from for a rusty Derry to see off Down, - to -, in the semi-final at the Athletic Grounds. “That  team was a heavily fancied team...more so than the following year, when there wasnt the same expectation” McEldowney states. “Big Ollie , Brian McCormick and Hugh Mullan were among the older players, but at least half of the team were underage the next year.” In the final, Rory Stevenson blotted out Antrim dangerman PJ OMullan in a - to - victory. Two Paddy McEldowney goals helped Derry out of the blocks. After hooking his marker, he pulled to the net midway through the first half. Collins also hit a brace of goals in a comfortable win. McGonagle plucked a ball in the first five minutes only for an Antrim hurl to follow through and break his thumb. When the adrenaline subsided after the game, the pain knocked him for six. McGonagle had to get it strapped up for the following Sunday, a two-point win in the Ulster minor football final at Clones. On the hurling front, it was off to Croke Park to take on a Cork team that contained  All-Ireland senior winning captain Mark Landers and Kevin Murray, who came on in the final. The  Derry minor team pictured before their All-Ireland semi-final defeat to Cork in Croke Park. Only two points separated the teams at half-time, with a goal from Michael Collins boosting Derry’s confidence. Goalkeeper Fergal McNally made a number of fine saves, with points from Collins , McCormick and Malachy McKenna keeping Derry ticking over at the other end. The Oakleafers, who lost McGonagle to injury after the interval, were left to also rue a number of missed chances which might have left things more interesting in what was a - to - defeat, with Cork losing out to the Cats in the final, after a replay. *** The  chapter was one of commitment and talent, bound together by team spirit built by Stevensons trips down the country. With the bad blood between Lavey and Screen buried, the training sessions – mainly at Glen and Slaughtneil – began to sharpen the skills. Paddy McEldowney, now the captain, remembers how Stevenson didnt even focus on Down or Antrim. It was all about getting ready for Croke Park. It was about developing a quick, direct game. The focus was a system of play to stop the better teams settling while Derry set about getting the ball to the inside forwards as quickly as possible. “Damper was probably taking a chance wed get to Croke Park and he was building for that,” McEldowney felt. “The training he set up was really intense,” McGonagle adds. When Stevensons son Rory told him of the players own decision to abstain from drink, it told him of the player-led desire to succeed. “Some of them were lads of  years of age and theyd be taking drink,” Peter remarks. “I was more concerned in coaching and getting them ready for matches. These lads took it upon themselves, very dedicated and committed...that sticks out for me.” Geoffrey speaks of the talent in the team, while McEldowney emphasised how enjoyable the season was. “We wonthe year before and did well in the All-Ireland semi-final, but the secondteam was dferent, it was something . It was a crazy enough gang and there were some headers on it,” McEldowney states. He struggled to put his finger on the exact ingredient, but it was a special group. Later, it would grow into an Ulster U title in  and later the All-Ireland B winning team. After picking up the  U champions on their way, it fed into Derrys back to back senior titles. “The likes of Gregory Biggs...hes probably the best lad you could get around a . For having the craic, but knowing when it is serious and when it is hurling time.” The traditional Ulster season for Derry minors, was a semi-final with Down followed by a crack at Antrim andyou were undercooked, the season was over almost before it began. Stevenson was dferent. He trekked Derrys crazy gang by bus to challenge games down the country over a four or five week period. “Damper knew what he was at, he knew what makes a team for the tough day out,” McEldowney said. “He knew we had a team when the rest of us didnt.” “They were all good games,” Geoffrey recalls of their preparation. “Results didnt matter, it was all about matching your performance and bettering yourself.” After one of the games, Stevenson summoned his captain to the front of the bus and instructed him to sit next to Geoffrey on the way home, with one task. “By the time the bus was back in Maghera, I needed to convince Geoffrey to stick with us . Damper was worriedthe squeeze was put on by the football camp, Geoffrey might pull out of the hurling. I done what I was told, I said he had to stick with us,” Paddy reveals. “I always gave everything to both codes,” added Geoffrey, who remembers Paddys chat and wasnt surprised. Stevenson was always thinking about the small things. Anything for the good of the team. The challenge games paid off and Down were put to the sword in the semi-final. Mickey Collins scored a hat-trick, Paddy McEldowney found the net, with McGonagle and Rory Stevenson chipping in with points. Antrim were waiting in the Ulster final and looked like they were going to end any thoughts of an Oakleaf Croke Park . PJ OMullan squeezed out - from corner forward and Jim Connolly was causing bother at wing-forward. The fancied Saffrons were in control, leading by five points at the break. “I remember the Dampercoming in at half-time and he wasnt a happy camper,” Geoffrey recalls. “He went off his head.” Man of the match McGonagle shaved the outside of the post with a goal chance and when Connolly added a second Antrim goal for a - to - lead, it was looking bleak. Derrys management made a series of switches. Mickey Blight McCloskey was sent to wing-back on Connolly, with Stevenson going to the centre. Benny Ward and Philip Hughes came into the team. “I remember saying to Seamus Dohertywe need to do something here to change the game,” Stevenson points out. Paddy McEldowney speaks of the mistake Antrim made of continuing to direct their puck-outs to the same wing, looking for Connolly, only to find an inspired McCloskey. “Mickey had some hand on him,” Geoffrey said. “He mustve caught about eight puck outs in a row and the Antrim keeper kept pucking it to him,” added McEldowney. With Derry having Antrim penned in and Biggs hitting a first Derry goal, the game began to change. Paddy McEldowney and Mickey Collins, who were getting no change from their markers, were switched. “It was like a last ditch move,” McEldowney remembers. “The first ball Mickey got, he stuck it in the net. The next ball I got, I put it over the bar and all of a sudden we were flying.” Their - in the final quarter blitzed Antrim as Derry retained their Ulster title. For McEldowney, it was indicative of the spirit in the team. “Thats why thatteam didnt give in during the Ulster final, and that we had a chance, so pushed on and kept believing,” he states. Brian McLernon presents Paddy McEldowney with the cup after Derrys  win over Antrim in Casement Park. With Kilkenny waiting in the All-Ireland series, Derry were brought back down to earth with a bang when Galway hammered them out the gate in a challenge game. “I think part of that was due to a very lax attitude,” recalls goalkeeper Joe Trolan. “That was supposed to be a weekend, but Damper didnt allow us to do anything after we got the beating. We were supposed to stay in Galway that night,” McGonagle remembers. “The whole thing was back on the bus and up the road...when we trained on the Monday night, he gave us some dogging.” With the defeat out of the system, the pep was back in the step. With the summer weather and Glens dry sod, preparations were in full swing for their crack at the All-Ireland champions. With future senior players Denis Byrne, Phily Larkin and PJ Delaney in their side, Kilkenny were three points up before Mickey McCloskeys ball from defence led to McGonagles opening score. Rory Stevenson assumed free-taking duties and a monster from well inside his own half was one of four points that day. “Barabbashardly gave PJ Delaney a puck of a ball,” Peter Stevenson remembers. Delaneys free-taking gave Kilkenny a foothold in the game, but he had a penalty saved by Rory Stevenson and cleared by McGonagle. Before half-time, Kilkenny failed to deal with Philip Hughes diagonal ball into the danger area and when Benny Ward was denied, Paddy McEldowney pulled the ball to the net. Going in at the break, Derry were well in the game. McGonagle remembers the half-time break and the blood pouring out of a cut on Sean McGlones eyebrow. As he lay on his back getting stitched up, Damper delivered his half-time words of advice. “There was no anaesthetic or anything like that,” McEldowney laughs. “Hewas only  and was some operator back then. “You had Sean Farmerat full back. He was only five foot six, but he was buck mad,” Paddy continues. “Damper wouldve worked on him, Squidgyand McGlone...he had them ready for any eventuality.” It was all part of what created the special team spirit. Now, with an All-Ireland final spot well within their grasp, this was the big picture. “Nobody expected us to beat Antrim, never mind giving Kilkenny a game,” McGonagle states. “That was the thing the Damperwas good at, he was good at motivating teams...he knew how to push the buttons.” “Damperwas at centre-half back that day, he was unreal, especially in the second half when we put the pressure on them.” Kilkenny were rattled in the second half and Phily Larkin was sent off for a strike on McGonagle. “I kept getting the ball and running at him,” remembers Geoffrey who set up Mickey Collins for Derrys second goal. “The next ball I got, I went past him and he pulled me down. When I got up he pulled the helmet off me and slapped me right in front of the referee.” Despite their stellar performance, it wasnt enough and Kilkenny held on for a three-point win on their way to retaining their title. “We were devastated, we knew we shouldve won that match. The game was there to be won,” laments McGonagle. “We had them rattled, but we just fell short.” Former Cats defender Ted Carroll, the county secretary at the time, stopped Peter Stevenson under the Hogan Stand after the final a month later. Carroll Derry for their part in Kilkenny minors success. They had poked the bear in the semi-final. Kilkenny were cocky with their heads up their arses against Derry, he told Stevenson. “I remember our conversation well,” Peter continues. “He told me how lucky Kilkenny were to come out of that with a win, that we had brought them down to earth and only for it, Tipperary wouldve beat them in the All-Ireland final.” The following year, Stevenson was back in charge, but lost to Down by four points. Geoffrey laments the loss of Gregory Biggs to injury, while also conceding that a third Ulster was beyond them. Looking back, it was a season of memories. Great days of laughter and hurling, with Cork and Kilkenny breathing a heavy sigh of relief.\",\"keywords\":\"Hurling,GAA,Peter Stevenson,Derry,kilkenny\",\"articleSection\":\"GAA\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Derry minor hurlers ran Cork close in the  All-Ireland minor semi-final.

With the Ulster title tucked away again, the following year, it was back to Croke Park where they pushed Kilkenny close. Michael McMullan spoke to some of those involved...Peter Stevenson knew his baptism as Derry minor hurling manager would be no ordinary one. Before theyd let fly on a sliotar in the  season, bridges needed mending. At the heel of the previous season, Lavey hosted Ballinascreen in the final of the South Derry minor championship. Stevenson, Derrys hurling board secretary at the time, was appointed as referee. The game wasnt finished. It was more than handbags. It was a proper rumpus. The sides had previously crossed paths in the county final and the needle boiling under the brim eventually erupted. Derry CCC handed out a blanket ban across both teams. Only Brian McCormick, who would star in Laveys All-Ireland club football campaign, was spared. googletag.cmd.push ”We didnt start training until all the suspensions were up,” Stevenson recalls of the pre-season. The Damper had applied for the job the previous year. Joe McGurk was appointed as manager, but Stevenson took over when the Lavey man stepped down at the end of . When the players arrived in the dressing room for the first step of their preparations, Stevenson laid it on the line. Club rivalry was to be left at home. They were Derry men now and cliques werent allowed. “If there were four involved in any of our drills, they had to be from dferent clubs where possible,” remembers captain Paddy McEldowney. googletag.cmd.push “He was a good manager,” said Geoffrey McGonagle. “I enjoyed him, he was good at getting the best out of everybody. He pulled everybody with him.” Without an Ulster league to shape a team for the championship cauldron, plans were hatched and buses booked for a series of challenge games down the country. Saturdays on the road helped create that special team environment. “Everybody had good time for each other, heading the one road and there for one reason,” McGonagle said. “A team is made on the bus on the way up and down,” McEldowney adds. “If the craic is good, thats the best place to keep that going.”     Thirty years on, a reunion was on the cards until social distancing put an end to that. From hearing the memories of those involved, it wouldve been mighty steam. *** After taking up a post in Dernaflaw school in , Stevenson began to spread the hurling roots to the surrounding areas. Five years earlier Liam Hinphey introduced the game in the nearby St Patricks Dungiven after finding a bag of unused hurls in a store. It helped form Dungivens club team, with Drum and Banagher later pulling away to form their own clubs. The game began to flourish as the level of coaching increased. Tom Magill had Lavey competing in and winning underage leagues in Antrim. The standard was on the rise. At St Patricks Maghera, success began to arrive with regularity and any inferiority complex in Derry hurling was fizzling out. A hammering of Cross and Passion Ballycastle in  brought a fourth Mageean Cup of the decade. Joe McGurk played Geoffrey, a fourth year, at centre-forward, to feed an attack that tore their opponents to pieces, after they hammered Garron Tower in the semi-final. “There was a three-year period when we were winning everything,” Paddy McEldowney outlines. “We had won an U hurling championshipwith the club around that time. Then it was straight into another MacRory and Hogan campaign before we hooked up with the minor hurlers.” Joe McGurk had Screen man Pat Joe McKenna with him and later added his brother Collie to the setup. It was a rush to get a team pulled together after the  Hogan Cup final needed a replay for Maghera to see of St Jarlaths. It took a goal from for a rusty Derry to see off Down, - to -, in the semi-final at the Athletic Grounds. “That  team was a heavily fancied team...more so than the following year, when there wasnt the same expectation” McEldowney states. “Big Ollie , Brian McCormick and Hugh Mullan were among the older players, but at least half of the team were underage the next year.” In the final, Rory Stevenson blotted out Antrim dangerman PJ OMullan in a - to - victory. Two Paddy McEldowney goals helped Derry out of the blocks. After hooking his marker, he pulled to the net midway through the first half. Collins also hit a brace of goals in a comfortable win. McGonagle plucked a ball in the first five minutes only for an Antrim hurl to follow through and break his thumb. When the adrenaline subsided after the game, the pain knocked him for six. McGonagle had to get it strapped up for the following Sunday, a two-point win in the Ulster minor football final at Clones. On the hurling front, it was off to Croke Park to take on a Cork team that contained  All-Ireland senior winning captain Mark Landers and Kevin Murray, who came on in the final. The  Derry minor team pictured before their All-Ireland semi-final defeat to Cork in Croke Park. Only two points separated the teams at half-time, with a goal from Michael Collins boosting Derry’s confidence. Goalkeeper Fergal McNally made a number of fine saves, with points from Collins , McCormick and Malachy McKenna keeping Derry ticking over at the other end. The Oakleafers, who lost McGonagle to injury after the interval, were left to also rue a number of missed chances which might have left things more interesting in what was a - to - defeat, with Cork losing out to the Cats in the final, after a replay. *** The  chapter was one of commitment and talent, bound together by team spirit built by Stevensons trips down the country. With the bad blood between Lavey and Screen buried, the training sessions – mainly at Glen and Slaughtneil – began to sharpen the skills. Paddy McEldowney, now the captain, remembers how Stevenson didnt even focus on Down or Antrim. It was all about getting ready for Croke Park. It was about developing a quick, direct game.

The companys other store in the city at Foyleside Shopping Centre on the cityside is to remain open. The closures have been prompted by ongoing challenges to high street trading, which have been exacerbated by the Covid- pandemic.

The book is  pages long, with over  images and a spokesperson for the Gelvin Historical Society has said it is brimming with nostalgia. “This is a must read for everyone as primary school featured in all our early lives,” they said. “The book style is simple and clear and the collection of stories is sure to rekindle a blend of distant and fond memories, and perhaps even mixed emotions, for all who read it.” googletag.cmd.push Below is an extract from the book, from the story The Football. “The year was  and we were in the senior classroom at Galvin. The new teacher, Master Brady, asked us how we all were andthere was anything we required. “A few nervous voices responded, A football Sir, we do not have a football.Master Brady seemed surprised that we did not have a football so he suggested we all bring in a pennyeach Friday. “After many weeks Master Brady announced that we had accumulated  dand he would buy a football in the town at the weekend.“At lunch break on the following Monday, Master Brady appeared in our long narrow playground with a new football.

Sean accidentally booted the ball straight into the large hawthorn hedge iding the playground and farm fields. “After a couple of minutes all we heard was a short lived ‘hiss’. We shook the hawthorn bush and the ball fell down. “We all gathered around looking in amazement. A short time later the new ball which no one had kicked, apart from Sean, resembled a flat rubber pancake. “I do not remember us ever getting a replacement football.” Those Were the Days is available to buy from retail outlets in the Dungiven, Drumsurn and Burnfoot areas, priced at pound.     It can also be bought from any member of the Gelvin Historical Society, or by calling Eugene , Mervyn , Susan , Henry , Anneor Sean .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes remain rooted to the bottom of the Premier Division following Saturday’s - defeat to Waterford at the Brandywell. McJannett’s first goal for the club was in vain as goals from Shane Grfin and Oscar Brennan gave the visitors their first win, goals which were gted to the Blues by their hosts. City’s generosity at the back leaves them with no points from their opening two fixtures for the first time since , and McJannett admitted that Derry had no-one to blame but themselves, holding his own hands up for his part in the second Waterford goal. googletag.cmd.push “We played quite well all in all but the goals we gave away are unforgivable,” he said. “They were just sloppy. We gave away a free kick and it’s gone in and then the second goal is unforgivable from my part and it’s a penalty. For all the good work, we’ve just thrown it away. It is hard to believe we’ve lost but when you look at the goals we gave away, they were as poor as you can get. We can’t say anything.” McJannett scored his first goal for the club on his th appearance as a Candystripe. He is the first defender to score City’s first goal in a season since Armin Aganovic back in , also against Waterford, but the versatile defender was not celebrating despite the long wait coming to an end. googletag.cmd.push “Yeah, at long last, but I don’t mean to be negative, but it feels a bit pointless at the minute because of the loss and the mistake for the goal,” he admitted. “At the time it felt nice and to get back in the game at that time. At the time I was very relieved because I felt partly to blame for the first goal as well. To get that literally with the last kick of the first half, it was a nice feeling but obviously in the second half it was a dferent story.” Daunting double City travel to Inchicore on Friday night and that is quickly followed by a home game against Shamrock Rovers next Tuesday, a daunting double for any team. St. Pat’s are steadily improving under Stephen O’Donnell, and sit in third place having won two of three games so far, while champions Shamrock Rovers have not lost a league game since September , a run of  league games.     Yet McJannett firmly believes that Derry City can respond to take points from both games, insisting that the improved attacking display against Waterford shows that the team is heading in the right direction. “We haven’t got any points from two games but we’ve said we’re sticking together and I’m sure we’ll start getting results,” he continued. “If we can play anything like that and cut out the goals we give away, then we’ll start getting points. It will be hard but we’re sticking together and we know thatwe perform like that we’ll get results. I know St. Pat’s and Rovers are good teams but that’s not to say we can’t beat them and start climbing the table.” Poor results generally set the mood around the club and amongst the fans, and McJannett knows the importance of a positive result in the coming days. “I know everyone will look at the result and heads will be down but the performance was good,” he added. “On another day the chances go in and we take them but we have to start taking our chanceswe are to have any chance of getting higher in the table this season.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue.Caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.The parkrsquos th century greenhouse is also being restored with the reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames, while one of several outbuildings will be converted to an office and volunteer space.Elsewhere, visitor facilities will be created in the Stove Conservatory including an interpretation centre, with a  lt installed to provide access to the terrance for people with reduced mobility.Since , the local authority has been progressing with plans to restore the natural and built heritage of the forest park with several key stakeholders including Forest Service.The councilrsquos vision is to create a heritage-led destination which protects the heritage of Castlewellan Forest Park for future generations, whilst also providing opportunities for local people and visitors to learn more about the landscape.The lsquoRe-rooting our past in the Future: Castlewellan Historic Demesnersquo project will connect people with the built and natural heritage within the forest park, as well as restore and celebrate its unique bioersity.This includes the restoration of a living arboretum, containing some of the most signicant collection of trees and shrubs on the island of Ireland.As part of the project, the Grange will be developed into a visitor core with the creation of a welcome centre, community space and cafeacute facilities, with the Courtyards transformed into a vibrant visitor hub and dedicated centre for community use with interpretation, activities, events, environmental education and skills development.In addition, the landscape will be conserved and managed sensitively, protecting its plant collection and important bioersity.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said the flagship project has been designed to deliver the local authorityrsquos vision of transforming the picturesque forest park into a ldquodynamic, heritage-led destination, restoring, celebrating and interpreting the natural and built heritage of the historic demesne.And she paid tribute to members of a task-board that has supported the development of the project since .ldquoI live in Castlewellan and have been on the task-board from day one and am delighted that the council has received this financial support,she said. ldquoI look forward to the delivery of the project as it will generate local economic, social and environmental benefits.As the former demesne of the Annesley family, the forest park is steeped in natural and built heritage dating back to s.The park is an integral part of the Castlewellan community and provides locals and visitors with recreational space for outdoor activities such as, cycling, horse riding, fishing on the lake, canoeing and orienteering.At the heart of the park is the arboretum and walled Annesley Garden, the latter which provides a central focal point for the National Arboretum with the pound.m investment package designed to re-establish the historical nature of the planting in the arboretum.The Heritage Fundrsquos Northern Ireland Director, Paul Mullan, said landscapes and nature ldquoform the bedrock of our culture and heritage, improving wellbeing, sparking curiosity, and protecting and providing for the communities surrounding and inhabiting them.He continued: ldquoNational Lottery players have highlighted natural heritage as especially important, which is why we are proud to award Newry, Mourne and Down Council a grant to create a heritage-led destination at Castlewellan Historic Demesne.ldquoThe Heritage Fund is incredibly proud to be playing a role in ensuring our natural heritage is safeguarded for generations to come, but also that the projects we fund give people the chance to connect with the nature that is on their doorsteps.Council officials say it is widely acknowledged that parks and open spaces play a hugely important role in supporting local communities, both in terms of providing recreational space, but also for supporting health and wellbeing.They add: ldquoAs we move towards recovery from Covid, the implementation of this project is timely and will benefit the citizens of the district through reconnecting people with their heritage, community and nature creating a safe, vibrant welcoming park for all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-50.jpg","title":"50 not out as Jeff clocks half century at Dundrum  ","story":"JEFF Maguirersquos love affair with cricket started  years ago.The Dundrum Cricket Club stalwart says itrsquos a love story which ranks second only to that with his family.Jeff says he is proud of the journey which has blessed him with friendships for le. These affinities were formed all across the globe, from as far away as India, Sri Lanka, Australia and across the island of Ireland.ldquoItrsquos hard to believe that I am  years going to the Meadow at Dundrum Cricket Club and I still get a buzz when going through the new gates, says Jeff.ldquoI can still remember playing in the winning side in the Downshire Cup final at the best new ground in the Northern Cricket Union at Strangford Road in Downpatrick.Jeffrsquos Dundrum side defeated Downpatrick Cricket Club, with his brother Noel scoring  odd to defeat a strong home side that featured superb players, including Alfie Linehan, Noel Ferguson and Jim Patterson, who all played for Ireland, Alfiersquos brother, Hugh, who Jeff believes should have been capped, and superb all rounder Brian Ferris.Jeff reminisces fondly of that game. ldquoI got to play in front of a decent crowd alongside two of the best club players our village ever produced, one being my brother Noel and the other being Alan Neill. I remember going to bed a little tipsy, the true version would not be believed long before the snowflake culture.Jeff proudly captained the first team for seven seasons, winning back-to-back McGready Cup finals at Dundrum after beating North West Cricket Union teams Bonds Glen and The Nedd.ldquoBoth games had a fantastic atmosphere. They brought a full  seater bus packed with refreshments and both teams stayed long into the night at the Bay Inn as they enjoyed the village hospitality.However, there were hard times for Dundrum as Jeff recalls a second arson attack against the club  years ago.ldquoIt simply showed the fighting character of the committee and members. I wrote lots of begging letters and phone calls for help, he recalled.ldquoI got a massive shock when I received a cheque made out to myself for pound, from the Foundation of Sports and Arts. I give special thanks to former Australian player James Burston for his input.The club received a further pound, from Down District Council and used local firm Seamus Walsh and Sons to build the excellent present pavilion at the cost of pound,, signying the start of rebuilding the club in every aspect.Paying homage to the clubrsquos ground staff who Jeff calls ldquothe real stalwarts, he gives praise to Tommy Curlett , who has looked after the square for over  years. Over the last decade, Tommyrsquos brother, Jack, has also been assisting, with Jeff mentioning Jack as ldquoone of the clubrsquos best ever all rounders.Jeff also applauded two more Curlett brothers, Bobby and Jim, who built the superb new electric score box free of charge.Also earning praise is new treasurer Stephen Calvert, who Jeff describes as the ldquodriving force behind the scenes, displaying fantastic forward thinking and planning everything down to the last detail.He continued: ldquoStephen now prepares the wickets, and I have never seen a harder worker in my le. From clearing the banks to planting the hedges and securing grants, he is a very tight treasurer that all clubs need.Not only a celebrated player, it is clear that Jeff has became an influential figure at the Dundrum club.Twelve years ago the club backed his request to employ the first of many successful overseas coaches, Sri Lankan Manoj Fernando.ldquoIt is the main reason the club isthriving, he said. ldquoThe junior section has been very successful with six of the players now playing for the first team and many more playing for the seconds and thirds.ldquoThe juniors have been on tour to Scotland three times, whilst also going to Telford. There is another good crop of kids coming through.Alongside his achievements on the field, Jeff nods kindly to the accolade he received in  when he was presented with the Jim McMorran Waterford Crystal Bowl for voluntary services to cricket from the Northern Cricket Union.ldquoFor my th birthday, I ran a fundraising soft ball fun match and barbecue, which raised pound, towards new set covers. I will remember as much due to the coverage legendary reporter David Holmes gave me on social media.All good things must come to an end as Jeff recalls two operations in  which forced his thoughts on retirement.Jeff decided to run a fundraiser inviting players from dferent clubs to attend. ldquoAs a thank you to a sport that has given me something that money could never buy, I ran two T games with refreshments and a raffle. I could not believe we raised pound, towards a new electric scorebox.ldquoIt was a very emotional day for me as I wandered around the ground with my grandson James. I was amazed at the decent crowd as I bowled the first ball and walked off to enjoy the day. But deep down, it hurt that I could not play.Jeff will be holding his last ever fundraiser this July, with the money going towards new enclosed two bay practice nets. He is set to organise two T games with added barbecue and refreshments as a final swansong to his beloved cricket.ldquoThe game of cricket has been a massive part of my le,  not out and burn the whites declared Jeff.He does, however, look eagerly ahead to the new season, which is planned to start the first week in May.ldquoItrsquos a testament to all the hard work at the club that it can now field three senior teams, with captain James Martin leading a very decent side for the new season. They can, no doubt, be very competitive.Looking to the future, he added: ldquoThe club is also excited about new coach Dan Kearsley, who begins his position after Easter and will be at Shimna Integrated College every Thursday.ldquoThe club is committed to attracting new young boys and girls to the great game of cricket..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Conor.jpg","title":"Conor keeps in contention for number one position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK goalkeeper Conor Hazard gave a very impressive display on his Windsor Park debut for Northern Ireland on Sunday evening.Hazard made a number of fine saves throughout the friendly match, but was unable to stop his side losing -

Itrsquos a point that anglers disagree with.DERA explained the work on the banks of the river created two dedicated disabled parking spaces in the car park where previously there had been none and that it is not satisfactory for disabled anglers to make their way to access current angling facilities located away from the car park.A spokesman for Downpatrick anglers said they are pleased that consideration is now being given to providing two new dedicated disabled fishing stands.ldquoWe welcome DAERArsquos confirmation that officials are also keen to meet with us to discuss our concerns which is an important step forward, he said.ldquoThe fact that the rights of disabled anglers at the Quoile River are now being recognised is also a welcome step forward. Redeveloping the car park and providing disabled parking spaces but no area for those with mobility issues to fish from was an error which now looks as though it is going to be rectied.The spokesman said he hopes that DAERA will also inform Newry, Mourne and Down Council about the plan to now provide disabled fishing stands at the riverbank car park.ldquoWe would hope councillors are informed via email or letter so there is a record of the commitment to carry out this work, he said.ldquoMoving forward, we believe that there is a need for DAERA and the Environment Agency to join forces to develop a training programme for their respective staff on how to handle the needs of disabled anglers in particular.The spokesman said lessons need to be learned from the Quoile River debacle and hopes that everyone involved can now move forward in partnership.ldquoDisabled anglers have been stopped coming to the river to fish for over a year since work to redevelop the car park got underway. Had the needs of disabled anglers been uppermost in the minds of government officials at the planning stage, it would not have taken  months to reach the point we are now thankfully at, he said.ldquoEveryone associated with Downpatrick Anglers is looking forward to seeing the new fishing stands in place soon and the welcomeof disabled anglers. They are part and parcel of the fishing community and must enjoy equal rights when it comes to their support.The spokesman added: ldquoAs we have always said, fishing is very therapeutic and we would strongly argue that the provision of new disabled angling stands on the banks of the Quoile should be a priority and will be of tremendous benefit..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Shirley.jpg","title":"Fountain Foodbank thanks public for help in lockdown  ","story":"THE Fountain Foodbank is continuing with its vital role in supporting families across the district.A year after going into lockdown, the cross-community organisation based in Downpatrick mdash staffed by committed volunteers mdash continues to meet a pressing need.In its latest newsletter, the foodbank says it continues to be extremely well supported by local people and organisations and that every penny it receives makes a dference.Shirley Lennon, the foodbankrsquos co-ordinator, has revealed that decisions regarding how the organisation could operate during a global pandemic had to be made quickly to deal with the evolving situation and continually revised as time moved on.She explained that initially, the foodbank operated a lsquodrive-thrursquo service which soon had to be replaced with a delivery service for the first period of lockdown.ldquoWe were grateful to many younger people who helped with both the packing and delivery of these parcels.

These workers are not using buses or cars and it is good financially that they donrsquot have to pay for car parking or fuel. And for Downpatrick, there will be dozens more people on the streets in the town, bring lots of benefits.Mr McGrath also acknowledged that the move towards regional hubs could result in empty office space in and around Belfast where a huge number of civl servants were traditionally based.ldquoThatrsquos the challenge mdash to repurpose those buildings mdash but we certainly cannot have vacant government buildings in the city centre being held on to for five,  or  years, he continued.The local MLA also believes that moving civil servants away from Belfast could provide an economic spin-offs for towns like Downpatrick.He added: ldquoIrsquom a fan of decentralisation in the public sector. It guarantees footfall in regional towns and that brings fairness to the rate and taxpayer. They get the benefits of having a workforce near them, especially the hospitality and retail businesses.ldquoIf you have  or  civil servants there they will spend a certain amount of money every week in those businesses while the city centre has a dferent product it can sell to attract those people at weekends.Developing Rathkeltair House as a regional jobs hub has been welcomed by a number of

pound.m investment that will create  new jobs.A development proposal for a vacant corner site lodged at the start of the month is seeking full permission to develop a new petrol station featuring eight pumps, convenience shop with deli counter, canopy and underground storage tanks.The proposal also features three electric vehicle charging points, car parking for  vehicles, a jet wash, play area, landscaping and site and access works.Planning papers confirm that the site will be accessed off the Magheraknock Road with the proposed development offering over  car parking spaces, four of which will be reserved for disabled drivers and another two for mothers and toddlers.The papers say that due to the ldquomodest scale of the development and low numbers of cars generated, it is not anticipated that the development will have any detrimental impact on noise and air quality of the surrounding environment.Planning permission for a filling station, shop and car wash was previously granted for the development site in , with the planning papers outlining the proposed play area will be located at the south western boundary of the site and lead to a new pedestrian connection from the site to an existing footpath along the Ballynahinch Road.This has been designed to allow children within surrounding residential developments to use the play equipment.The planning papers say previous planning permission for  square metres of retail space is insufficient to meet the needs of the local neighbourhood which is devoid of local retail provision.ldquoThe application represents an opportunity to redesign the layout to provide a modern style of development on a prominent site at the corner of the Magheraknock Road and Ballynahinch Road which will provide a convenient roadside facility for surrounding rural settlements and a local conveniencefor the immediate residential context, the papers continue.ldquoThe design and layout of the proposal is not uncharacteristic of that of a typical roadside facility and has been designed to to take full cognisance of the sitersquos constraints and to ensure there are limited negative amenity impacts on surrounding residential receptors.A needs assessment document submitted as part of the planning application argues that the area around the proposed development site ldquolacks a local neighbourhood facility to serve existing developments and those that will be developed in the future.In addition, the assessment argues that the proposal will have a ldquonegligible impact on like-for-like development within the

Integrated Collegersquos new poundm campus in the autumn.Local planners have given the green light for the construction of the new -student school in Newcastle andit is hoped that building work will be completed in .The modern new three-storey school will be constructed to the east of the current main building at its sprawling Lawnfield site at King Street which will eventually be bulldozed.Included in the ambitious development plan are a range of new sports facilities which we will be shared with the Newcastle community.The new school proposal is being supported by the Department for Education and Integrated Education Fund with principal, Kevin Lambe, delighted that formal planning approval will be rubber-stamped by local councillors next week.Mr Lambe says the entire Shimna community is delighted that planning permission will go ahead for ldquoour wonderful new building.He said everyone was ldquoextremely excited that work on the new school will begin in the autumn term and that the new Year  students joining Shimna this September will be able to look forward to sitting their GCSEs and A levels in a purpose built, state-of-the art building.ldquoOf course, we have always been very proud of our current, semi-permanent building, which was begun in  mdash financed by parents on a bank loan mdash and which has grown with us through  years, Mr Lambe continued.ldquoIt will, in many ways, be a sad day to see that building come down. However, important though excellent facilities are, the core of a school is the student, staff, parent and governor body and they deserve a new building to match the commitment, enthusiasm and of course the Integrated ethos which drives this school.Mr Lambe thanked the Department of Education and the technical team behind the new school for the energy and creativity they have brought to the project.He also extended gratitude to Newry, Mourne and Down Council for addressing the schoolrsquos application for planning permission.Mr Lambe added: ldquoWe are particularly excited that the sports facilities for the new school will be shared with our local community and all the community partners who already meet in Shimna.Shimna College currently shares its sports halls, grounds and main building with a number of local groups and in  celebrated its th anniversary with its need for new accommodation one of a number of projects earmarked for financial support in the Fresh Start Agreement.The hugely successful integrated college opened in September  with just  pupils, but has since grown to become of Northern Irelandrsquos leading schools.However, the current school does not meet its needs or the standards specied in the current Department of Education Secondary School handbook.In February , education officials approved a development proposal to redevelop the integrated college to deliver a modern, post-primary school capable of accommodating the increased demand for integrated education in the area.The planning papers due to be formally approved next week outline a proposal to build ultra-modern accommodation to the east of the current school, with new sports accommodation extending to the west, encompassing part of the footprint of the existing school.A new single storey sports suite will extend from the schoolrsquos northwestern elevation of the new buildings and includes a hall, gym, fitness area and ancillary accommodation with the main school building intentionally designed to allow Shimna College to continue operating during construction work on the new-build.It is understood that phase one will focus on the construction of the main school building, excluding the proposed new sports provision. All of the existing school will be bulldozed when the new-build is complete, apart from the existing sports hall.It is believed that this part of the current post-primary building will only be razed to the ground when work on the new sports facilities have been completed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer action to make comeback  ","story":"LOCAL soccer clubs are in preparation after the resumption of training was given the green light.The Stormont Executive announced a plannedto training from April .Celtic Bhoys FC, Downpatrick and Killough FC are among the local clubs which have welcomed the news with open arms following a frustrating last few months.Celtic Bhoys FC have been working hard behind the scenes to prepare for training to take place at their newly built Ballyhornan facility.Club chairman Patrick Moore said: ldquoWe are really excited to be able to start afresh this season and make the most of our new state of the art G pitch and clubroom at Ballyhornan.ldquoWe will aim to maximise this as a community hub for local people and families throughout the coming year and we firmly believe this will provide a  for the club to grow and prosper in the post Covid- world.He continued: ldquoThere is no doubt that this has been an extremely dficult year for so many, particular those who have lost loved ones as a result of the pandemic.ldquoThe club is excited to have the opportunity to once again provide sporting and social activities to young and old in the local community.

The highest recorded speed was an eye-watering mph at Camlough.The number of drivers detected travelling at mph over the past three months by the seven speed indicator devices has reduced from  during April, May and June to  mdash a reduction of .%. The average percentage of cars travelling in excess of mph has also decreased slightly.Additional speed indicators are due to be erected at the Dundrum Road in Clough, Downpatrick Road in Ardglass and Ballynahinchrsquos Saintfield Road, with the PCSP planning to install seven more during the new financial year.But demand for the devices is high with a total of  requests lodged with the PCSP for them to be provided in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Willie Clarke have expressed concern that some drivers are continue to speed in built-up areas but have welcomed confirmation that overall, speeding in a number of hot spot areas is decreasing.Mr McGrath described the speeds recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick as ldquohorric and chilling.He continued: ldquoWhata local resident or child was to step onto this busy road  The footpaths are narrow in places, the lighting in the area is poor and residents are at times walking and driving in fear for their lives.ldquoSuch high speeds will not help allay their fears and I will be writing to the PSNI and asking for regular speed checks on this road to regulate the speed and ensure residentsrsquo safety.Cllr Clarke said while some of the speeds are very worrying, he said the data recorded by the speed indicator devices provides police with the information about where they need to be and at what time to catch those who are breaking the law and putting other road users and pedestrians at risk.ldquoI welcome the reduction in speed which the data reveals, but more needs to be done. Police now have the data they need to catch offenders and this is something that many people want to see happening, he continued.Cllr Clarke said the Department for Infrastructure also has a role to play in helping address the speeding issue.ldquoThe speed devices are having an impact and with plans for many more across the district, it is important that the critical data they provide will enable the authorities to apprehend those who are not only breaking the law, but placing themselves, other road users and pedestrians at risk, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford it’s like nowhere else on earth  ","story":"STUNNING Strangford Lough features prominently in a new Sunday Times guide with the area regarded as one of the three best places to live in Northern Ireland.While the accolade will not come as a major surprise to those who live and work on both sides of the internationally acclaimed waterway, the arearsquos recognition by one of the UK and Irelandrsquos top selling Sundays is nonetheless extremely noteworthy.While Holywood has been named as the top place to live in Northern Ireland in the Sunday Times Best Places to Live guide mdash ahead of Magherafelt mdash local focus will rightly be on Strangford Loughrsquos inclusion in the top three.The Sunday Timesrsquos expert judges behind the guide assess a wide range of factors, from schools, air quality, transport and broadband speeds to culture, green spaces and the health of the high street.They look for improving towns, villages or city centres, for attractive, well designed homes and locations bursting with community spirit which the coronavirus pandemic has shown to be the most vital quality of all.Of Strangford, the judges said: ldquoLive in Strangford, Portaferry or any of the villages around this beautul island-studded lough and yoursquove got unbeatable wildle and scenery on the doorstep ndash and itrsquos even betteryou can get out on the water.

Photo: Brian Little PA WireCentral to unionism reaching agreement in the Talks and the subsequent implementation period leading to devolution was the constructive approach taken by the Irish government, in particular the leadership shown by Bertie Ahern. Even as his own mother was dying, he remained focused on dialogue with unionists and loyalists, reassuring us that he wanted a new relationship with Northern Ireland based on cooperation and mutual respect rather than aggression and hostility. Twenty three years on that constructive approach has been replaced with overt hostility, threats, and renewed aggressive nationalism from Irish governments and ministers who have chosen to set aside the Belfast and St Andrew’s Agreements in order to impose a UK–EU protocol for Northern Ireland that weakens the United Kingdom and removes the key requirement for cross-community consensus that was the secret of the Belfast Agreement’s acceptance by both communities in Northern Ireland.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

This is in stark contrast to the Irish government’s negotiating position which used the threat of violence to mislead the EU\". Brian Lawless PAFirstly, the Irish Republic conducts up to % of its trade in or through the rest of the British Isles.It is a small, peripheral part of a greatly diminished European Union. Secondly, modern technology allows the real-time tracking of shipments and deliveries across the globe. If you order any delivery from flowers to motor vehicles you can track the status of that delivery online and even be given a guaranteed delivery date and time.The logic of this means that the transit of any goods can be remotely monitored and randomly inspected at any point. Why then can goods not flow freely, or unfettered, within the United Kingdomthey are pre-registered and subject to GPS monitoring. Why can goods bound from anywhere in the UK to the Republic of Ireland, and vice versa, not also be pre-registered and monitored. If goods are travelling from the UK to the European Union mainland they can be inspected at the ports of entry on the EU mainland eg Calais or Rotterdam etc. And finally,goods travel from the Republic of Ireland, through the UK to the EU mainland they can be pre-registered, sealed and despatched without interference. This removes the need for either a hard border on the island of Ireland or between Northern Ireland and the rest of our own country and it restores the rights and guarantees of the Belfast Agreement.I have failed to understand why Northern Ireland has been treated so dferently and so shabbily. Gibraltar for example, which also has a contentious land border with the EU has a Protocol which has not proved contentious. The Gibraltar authorities were part of the negotiating team with the EU. The result of their negotiation was put to the Gibraltar legislature for its approval, and Gibraltars’ representatives sit on the Standing Committees with Spain and the EU to monitor its performance.By contrast, the Northern Ireland Executive was not involved in the negotiation of the NI Protocol. The protocol was not put to the NI Assembly, or to the public here, for consultation or approval, and where are the NI representatives on the Standing Committees Further, loyalist and unionist groups and representatives are on record as asking for meetings with the EU negotiators to ensure the unionist position was understood. Meetings were repeatedly declined, and submissions on possible solutions were ignored.It is not dficult to conclude therefore that the Irish government viewed these negotiations as a means to re-ignite aggressive nationalism and punish unionism and the UK for supporting Brexit. In so doing they have undone twenty-five years of constructive dialogue and cooperation and have shown up their ‘shared island’ agenda to be a disingenuous scam. Looking to the future I have absolutely no doubt that common sense will prevail and the protocol will change. I am less sanguine about the possibility of the Irish government restoring constructive relationships with unionism.• David Campbell is a chair of the Loyalist Communities Council and a former Ulster Unionist MLA and close colleague to David Trimble at the time of the Belfast Agreement of • There ought still to be openings for constructive dialogue with Dublin——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe road would link Sycamore Cross on the A with Junction  of the M. A -week public consultation last year raised concerns about the impact on the environment and local communities.Responding to those concerns, the Vale of Glamorgan council has now said transport planners must analyse further how the road would fit in with the new context of Covid- and the climate emergency.In a report to the councilrsquos cabinet, which meets on Monday, March , detailed responses were given to the main concerns raised in the consultation. The cabinet will be asked to approve further analysis, before moving on to writing up a full business case for the road.The case for the road is to improve transport across the region, including to Cardf Airport, St Athanrsquos Enterprise Zone, and new housing developments. It would likely cost around pound million to build, and is dependent on funding from the Welsh Government.However, the proposals have drawn criticism from villagers in Pendoylan whose houses would be knocked down, cyclists using country lanes which could be blocked off, and Coed Cymru which has warned ancient woodland would be felled to make way for the road.Two options for the new road were consulted on: one to the east of Pendoylan and one to the west. The report revealed transport planners are edging towards the western route, as it is better value for money than the eastern one.As well as suggesting further analysis, the cabinet report addressed the main concerns including the impact on the climate, environment, walkers and cyclists, and uncertain future of the financially struggling Cardf Airport.On cycling, the new road would include a segregated lsquoactive travel routersquo for cyclists and walkers, the report said. Country lanes blocked off could have bridges or underpasses for walkers and cyclists to cross the new road.     MORE NEWS:The report said: ldquoThere is currently poor infrastructure and local connectivity by walking and cycling through the study area, and there is potential to implement new cycle connections. An active travel route is an integral component of the concept options.ldquoShould a preferred option progress to the next stage of assessment and a need to block the lanes confirmed, access for non-motorised users to safely cross under or over the bypass would be accommodated as part of the design.On climate change, campaigners raised concerns a new road would increase private car journeys and carbon emissions.Both the Welsh Government and the Vale council declared a climate emergency in , pledging to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures.A big part of the plan to reduce emissions in Wales is changing how people travel: fewer journeys in private cars and more by walking, cycling and in public transport.The report said further analysis would include a lsquocarbon assessment and climate resiliencersquo report, and would explore how to reduce the carbon impact of the road.It did not mention what these methods could include.Several areas of ancient woodland would have ldquovery large adverse impacts according to the report. But further assessment would examine the exact effects of the loss of that woodland.The report said: ldquoThe environmental assessment would examine the loss of woodland in terms of its use in flood retention, water quality, social value, carbon capture, landscape value and cultural heritage value, as well as its value to bioersity.If the ldquovery large adverse impacts canrsquot be avoided by redesigning the road, new trees could be planted where to compensate for the loss of ancient woodland.This would include moving and replanting some of the old trees and soil.The next stage would also include a wider, detailed environmental impact assessment, and recommendations on how to mitigate potential impacts on the environment surrounding the proposed road.Another concern raised has been the uncertain future of Cardf Airport, which was recently bailed out by the Welsh Government with a pound. million grant.But transport planners pointed to plans to make it easier to get to the airport on foot, by bike, bus, train, and in private motor vehicles.The cabinet report said: ldquoWhile recognising that the basis of future studies would increasingly need to consider the emerging trends and patterns resulting from Covid-, it is understood that the long-term vision of the airport remains at this present time.Responding to the report, campaigners have renewed calls for the Vale council to scrap the plans for the road altogether.A spokesperson for Vale Communities for Future Generations said: ldquoWhy the Vale of Glamorgan council is persisting in wasting public money on keeping this outdated road plan alive is hard to understand. The sheer volume of recent objections to the proposal clearly indicates the public has other priorities.ldquoThe original  Vale council assumption was that the road was needed for better vehicle access to Cardf Airport mdash which was denied by the airport management.ldquoSince then the airportrsquos passenger numbers have shrunk, millions of pounds of public money has been spent by the Welsh Government on propping it up financially and the future of air travel globally is uncertain post Covid  pandemic.ldquoThese are hardly the circumstances under which to continue promoting an expensive and environmentally destructive road building plan that was developed before the Vale of Glamorgan council and the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency in .ldquoIt is time for this plan to be recognised as a prime example of outdated thinking, and finally scrapped so that Vale of Glamorgan council can prioritise spending on environmentally sound projects. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Traders have got to remember that.Residents and friends Tracey Scott and Debra Cooper have enjoyed visiting the unusually quiet beach at weekdays through the pandemic, but said they will avoid the seafront this weekend.ldquoI hope people continue to be weary, Ms Scott, who lives alone at her home in Llandough, said. ldquoBut it seems to me recently people have stopped social distancing as much.ldquoI come here with friends and family sometimes three times a week, but I have to avoid it on weekends now.ldquoThere are just hordes of people not keeping to social distancing rules. Itrsquos a great shame.ldquoI walked with my mother here not long ago and was being bumped into by people. I canrsquot put myself at risk, and I canrsquot put others at risk.ldquoItrsquos so dficult because I live alone and I keep away from people Irsquod very much like to hug. Then someone comes and brushes past me. I know it sounds odd, but you do feel almost violated when that happens.ldquoItrsquos dficult, because I really do want the businesses to thrive here and I would like to support them on the weekends.ldquoMy message to people would be lsquogive it time, and letrsquos play it safe ndash donrsquot all rush at oncersquo.Ms Scottrsquos son and his partner, in their twenties, are also avoiding weekend trips to the seafront due to her son having asthma.Ms Cooper said: ldquoFor months now Irsquove only gone out in the week because it gets so busy. Itrsquos strange ndash the nice weather comes and the residents keep out the way.Hugh Pickford, who owns Pickfordrsquos Gallery and Bar With Rooms on the seafront, says he feels for residents, and itrsquos become dficult for traders to police overcrowding.ldquoItrsquos probably bred by us not being able to open indoors and police the situation ourselves, he said.Social distancing signs remain after the road had to be temporarily closed due to people packing the Esplanade over ChristmasldquoAt the moment people come and get a takeaway and go across the road. The problem is thatrsquos what everyone is doing. It doesnrsquot look great at times. But what can we do ldquoOver Christmas it looked almost like a carnival atmosphere to be honest.ldquoIrsquod like to look on the bright side. The seafront has really seen a revival in the last couple of years. Even at am now Piotr at Stol Coffee draws a crowd here. Itrsquos nice to see.That revival is continuing this weekend too as a new cafeacute opens inside the Pier Pavilion.The new rules mean the Pickfords can open their rooms to all people in Wales again.Hugh PickfordldquoWersquove not had much interest at the moment in the rooms, he said. ldquoPeople booked for April and then cancelled when they realised it was room service only. People donrsquot seem to want to eat off the premises or in their rooms, so thatrsquos hitting us a bit.ldquoWersquore looking forward to the summer. With staycation season likely to be ahead of us, it should be a great place to be.What you saidResidents have been responding when asked what they thought of the new changes.Jo Broad, from Blackwood, predicted: ldquoPeople will go crazy. Of course we need our lives back or at least some sort of normality. The beaches will be full again.ldquoLetrsquos hope people will be sensible, not go crazy, and letrsquos hope for safety, or I think there might be a summer lockdown coming.Newport resident Lisa Edwards said: ldquoPeople need to stop hiding behind the government. We are in charge of our own destiny and we have to resume some normality.ldquoTo do this, we need to be allowed to resume living, but sensibly.

Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices.

Mr Lundgren told BBC Breakfast mandatory tests for people ing from ldquogreen countries ldquoshould not be needed.He said: ldquoI donrsquot think that is fair, I donrsquot think itrsquos right, and I donrsquot think it is necessarily established from a medical and scientic point of view that is the right thing to do.ldquoIf they choose, however, to go down that route to have the tests in place, it should be the same type of testing, the lateral flow testing, which is much cheaper, more accessible, that is being used to open up the domestic sector as an example. vw,vw,px, px\"Polymerase chain reactiontests are swab tests that are processed in a laboratory, and cost around pound each in the UK for private customers.This is ldquoway over and above what the cost is of an average easyJet fare, Mr Lundgren explained.Requiring passengers to pay for PCR tests ldquowouldnrsquot open up international travel for everyone, he said.Rapid tests, or lateral flow device tests, are swab tests that give results in  minutes or less, without the need for processing in a laboratory.Everyone in England will have free access to those tests twice a week from Friday.Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss told reporters that people should be able tofrom ldquogreen countries without the need for tests ldquowhen it is safe to do so.He added: ldquoWe canrsquot have a prohibitively expensive testing system that puts businesses, people and families off travelling.ldquoPassengers travelling to and from lsquogreenrsquo countries should be able to do so freely, without testing or quarantine at all, and vaccinated passengers travelling to and from lsquoamberrsquo countries should not face testing or quarantine.Mr Weiss said destinations that should be on the ldquogreen list from May  include the US, Israel and the Caribbean.The US is ldquovaccinating over three million people per day, Israel is ldquothe worldrsquos leading vaccinated country, and the Caribbean ldquohas done an awesome job throughout this pandemic of keeping things under control, he explained at a joint press conference with Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye and British Airways boss Sean Doyle.Mr Holland-Kaye said the United Arab Emirates could be included as ldquothey also have very high levels of vaccination.He went on: ldquoThere are plenty of long-haul countries which have low Covid levels, and many of them have high vaccination levels also.Mr Doyle cited recent research by consultancy York Aviation which suggested that a ldquolost summer of international travel would cost the UK economy pound. billion in a decrease in trade and pound billion in a cut in tourism.Travel to and from the US is ldquovitally important for all of us here in the UK, he said, adding: ldquoNo air link to the US until September will cost the UK an additional pound. billion.

But I would appeal to people not to let their frustrations affect their judgement. These restrictions are in place to protect us from a vicious virus that has brought great tragedy to so many families. “When we are following them, we are helping keep ourselves and others safe – and helping our community get to a better place. “We are continuing to make good progress. The statistics on COVID- have been moving steadily in the right direction and more than three quarters of a million people in Northern Ireland have received their first vaccine dose. “We are on a pathway towards gradually easing restrictions. Theof schools and expansion of outdoor activities are the first careful steps on this route map. He added: Some regulations have been eased this week, and more welcome decisions will steadily followwe can keep COVID- infections down. “But it’s still important to follow the basics. That includes maintaining social distancing, wearing a face covering and washing hands frequently and well. Stay at home as much as possible and stay local when you are enjoying the great outdoors. Avoid crowded places, especially where it would be hard to keep your distance from others. “Make fresh air your friend this Easter weekend – outdoors is much safer than indoors. Please please don’t mix indoors with people from other households. “I want to thank everyone once again for all they have done over the past year to help repel COVID.
