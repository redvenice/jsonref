Staffordshire women are a tough breed – much tougher than the pant-wetters of the London elite who have been jibbering about further cave-ins to the European Commission. You do sometimes wonder how veggie Hilary Benn has enough fight in him to spear his Quorn rissoles of a morning.Boris twists the knife: Johnson blasts May for \u0027kowtowing\u0027...Remain is 12 points ahead of Leave in new poll of how...Share this articleA gleaming yellow JCB had been parked behind the small dais from which Boris made his half-hour speech. He was quick to capitalise on the image. After enthusing about JCB’s global success and letting slip some market-sensitive information about the firm’s sales (up 20 per cent), he enthused about how ‘these custard colossi can move almost any obstacle out of their path’. This other custard-topped colossus added that if you engage the wrong gear in a JCB you can accidentally end up with ‘a new entrance in the back of your house’.          His commendable recent weight loss, which some attribute to a gymnastic new popsy, was evident in his suit trousers. They sagged from him like a flag on a windless dayHe feared that might be what the Government does to our national prospects unless it ‘fires up the engines, stops dithering’, points in the other direction and removes a few ‘boulders’ that lie between us and our independence.Boris said he would be ‘utterly amazed’ if we failed to get an acceptable deal after telling the ‘marmoreal edifice’ of the EU that it is only getting half our 39billion quid until the deal is completed. It was time to ‘stop kowtowing’ to the Europeans.  Mr Johnson (pictured making his speech today) insisted Britain would flourish even if it had to leave without a deal on March 29Again, this is hardly innovative. Half the country thinks it an obvious tactic. But how often do we hear a politician or commentator say it?There is less of Boris than of old. His commendable recent weight loss, which some attribute to a gymnastic new popsy, was evident in his suit trousers. They sagged from him like a flag on a windless day.Now that he is drinking less, has his voice lost some of its gravelly bottom? A little, I sensed.The audience of 200 factory hands listened attentively, particularly when Boris gave a hypothetical example of how staying enslaved to EU standards could damage British manufacturers.A firm like JCB, he said, could invent a brilliant new telescopic arm for its tractors, only to find the EU outlawing the device because it did not want continental rivals to be upstaged. Under many proposals currently being touted round Westminster, such a ban would apply in the UK, even though we were no longer a member of the EU. The audience’s ears pricked at this.‘That’s not Brexit and that’s not democracy,’ said Boris. There should be ‘nothing embarrassing’ about patriotism. ‘Let’s reinforce our national optimism.’A couple of the broadcasters accused him of merely making a leadership pitch. Oh, so what? What’s wrong with showing that you have the guts and vision to be leader?Mrs May has said she is retiring soon. To have the no-deal case put with such vigour actually strengthens her position. It shows the EU that although the Blairites and Lib Dems and Scots Nats and Philip Hammonds are feeble pushovers, at least the real heart of the Tory party still pumps with self-belief and a determination to obey the referendum result."},{"url":null,"title":"Zoe Ball 1 6m BBC Radio 2 paid predecessor Chris Evans says father","story":"    Zoe Ball, 48, outside Wogan House in London after her first morning hosting the BBC 2 Breakfast Show on Monday  Chris Evans (left) was paid a £1.6m salary when he was hosting Radio 2\u0027s Breakfast Show, Johnny Ball (right) says that his daughter deserves parity\u0027She\u0027s had 15 years of greedy vase-owners... and now she\u0027s...\u0027Show two is like the second tricky album\u0027: Zoe Ball thanks...Share this articleHe told the paper his daughter was superb value for money, saying that if some people thought her salary was too great they should complain to the BBC.The BBC has faced a raft of criticism for its male dominated salaries.The heavy-hitters for 2017-18 were Gary Lineker (£1.75m), Chris Evans (£1.6m) and Graham Norton (£600,000).The highest paid woman for that year was Claudia Winkleman (£370,000) who placed 13th in the male dominated list.Miss Ball became Radio 2\u0027s first female weekday breakfast show host on Monday.

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) on Arriva Rail North are already striking on Saturday and on January 26Northern, which is run by Arriva, said only a handful of services will run after 5pm on those Saturday evenings, causing serious disruption for shoppers and sports fans. The weekend strikes have been disrupting services on Northern Rail since last August.Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, claimed Northern was ‘not interested’ in talking to them to try to resolve the two-year dispute. Staff are protesting over the firm’s decision to remove guards from services.

They should listen to their staff and pull back from that plan immediately.’Mr Cash said tomorrow’s strike, the 45th consecutive Saturday of disruption, would again be supported ‘solidly’ by RMT members. According to the most recent figures, train punctuality slumped to a 13-year low after chaos caused by new timetables and engineering works last year.Nearly 15 per cent of trains – one in seven – fell short of the public performance measure (PPM), the industry’s standard measure of punctuality.At the same time, passengers are paying higher fares, with tickets increasing by 3.1 per cent on average this month. That equates to more than £100 on season tickets from Manchester to Liverpool , with others facing rises of above £200 from more distant stations.  Northern said few services will run after 5pm on Saturday, hitting travellers including shoppers and sports fansNorthern, which covers the North West and North East regions of England, has been beset by punctuality problems and customer service issues and ridiculed for its use of two-car Pacer trains built in the 1970s.David Brown, managing director at Northern, defended the firm’s decision to press ahead with removing guards from their services. ‘More than 50 per cent of all rail journeys in the UK are made on driver-controlled trains,’ he said. ‘Recently the Department for Transport and Transport for the North publicly confirmed that a second person – in addition to the driver – would be retained on Northern services.‘This second person will provide customer service, including meeting customer needs on accessibility, safety, security, ticketing and information.’He said there was no reason for the RMT to continue its ‘disruptive and economically damaging strikes’, but despite this, the RMT was continuing with strike action.‘We expect all of our services on Saturdays in January to be extremely busy and are calling on our customers to plan their travel carefully for the coming weekend,’ he added. ‘Check the new timetables well in advance, and make sure they do not rely on the last trains home.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Two thirds singles 20s live

He was quick to capitalise on the image. After enthusing about JCB’s global success and letting slip some market-sensitive information about the firm’s sales (up 20 per cent), he enthused about how ‘these custard colossi can move almost any obstacle out of their path’. This other custard-topped colossus added that if you engage the wrong gear in a JCB you can accidentally end up with ‘a new entrance in the back of your house’.

Mr Johnson (pictured making his speech today) insisted Britain would flourish even if it had to leave without a deal on March 29Again, this is hardly innovative. Half the country thinks it an obvious tactic. But how often do we hear a politician or commentator say it?There is less of Boris than of old.

Under many proposals currently being touted round Westminster, such a ban would apply in the UK, even though we were no longer a member of the EU. The audience’s ears pricked at this.‘That’s not Brexit and that’s not democracy,’ said Boris.

Despite retirement, one detail of his life has not changed — the need for round-the-clock police protection. Strict rules govern the movement of royals and it is extremely unusual for senior members of the Queen\u0027s family to go anywhere in public without a bodyguard.At home, or on the royal estates, the protection is largely withdrawn. It has been this way for decades and by and large the royals accept the system. But from time to time Philip, who has put up with it longer than anyone apart from the Queen, has attempted to rebel.On one occasion at Balmoral when the Queen and the Prince were due to travel separately to visit friends on a neighbouring estate, Philip insisted on driving on his own.He REFUSED to allow an officer to get into his car, only to find that the policeman had the keys. When the Queen rolled down her window to ask what the delay was, the Prince replied he couldn\u0027t find the keys.The bodyguard then piped up that he had them and Philip relented, commanding the hapless officer to \u0027just get in\u0027. \u0027The Duke liked to try it on occasionally, especially if his personal protection officer was not familiar to him,\u0027 says an ex-royal bodyguard. \u0027But he usually accepted the situation.\u0027I\u0027m a fool\u0027: Prince Philip pleaded \u0027get me out\u0027 as he was...The Queen, 92, drives her Range Rover without a seatbelt on...Share this article\u0027Of course, it is up to the officer to insist that they go with him and that can be quite tough bearing in mind the stature of the Duke of Edinburgh.\u0027Friends say that Philip has been profoundly shaken by the accident and that, despite his obstinacy, will be preparing to give up driving. \u0027Of course it will be a nuisance if he can\u0027t drive himself,\u0027 says one figure who has been a passenger in the Prince\u0027s car, \u0027but he has a lot of common sense and is likely to say to himself that the game is up.\u0027I would expect him to take the same approach that he did to flying, when he stopped even though he was quite capable of continuing for several years. He took the view that if something had gone wrong, his age would be used to criticise him.\u0027According to his old friend and biographer Gyles Brandreth, he will adopt a pragmatic approach. He won\u0027t welcome being told he can\u0027t drive, says Brandreth.\u0027But if you can\u0027t do it any more, you can\u0027t do it any more. He\u0027s a pragmatist and a realist and I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll accept that while possibly muttering under his breath.\u0027 The Prince had similarly unsentimental thoughts when the time came for him to announce his retirement.Buckingham Palace is under pressure to intervene over Prince Philip\u0027s determination to keep driving despite a horror smash near Sandringham (pictured)  The arthritis from which he has suffered for more than 20 years had worsened, compromising his mobility and he did not wish to become a liability.Nor as someone who has taken pleasure in his supreme fitness — a hostess once told me that he had brought a chest expander and dumb-bells when he came to stay — would he wish to be seen physically struggling with the demands of carrying out engagements.\u0027He has his pride,\u0027 says a courtier, \u0027he would not want to be seen in a wheelchair.\u0027With his grandsons William and Harry taking on more official duties, he grasped the opportunity to stand down. What has puzzled observers however is that rather than spending more time together, Philip and the Queen see less of one another than before. Philip\u0027s life now centres on Windsor and Wood Farm, the spacious but modestly furnished cottage on the Sandringham estate that for years has been their bolthole from the formality of Buckingham Palace.He loves it there and has made it his retirement base, reading, painting watercolours, writing letters and having friends to stay. An old acquaintance says: \u0027He is enjoying reading things he\u0027s always wanted to read and gets up to what he wants without an equerry telling him he has to be elsewhere, or a camera following him.\u0027This has all come with his wife\u0027s blessing. After more than 71 years of happy marriage, the Queen still feels a need to show her love and gratitude to the man who she emotionally described on their 50th anniversary as her \u0027strength and stay\u0027.All the same, it is surprising for a couple who have been together for so long to be spending more time apart as they reach such a remarkable landmark in their lives.But as a courtier explains: \u0027The Queen feels the Duke has earned a proper retirement. She knows him too well — if he was still at the centre of royal life he\u0027d feel he had to be involved.\u0027Being at Wood Farm means that he\u0027s not too far away, but far enough to be able to relax.\u0027One of his first tasks was to install a new kitchen, the first for 30 years.What is plain to those who surround this elderly couple is that the Queen and Philip have settled comfortably into a new rhythm of married life. She misses him, though, especially at the breakfast table, which they always shared.Now, the Queen sits alone and is rarely seen before the daily 11am meeting with her private secretary. The younger royals, particularly Prince Andrew and the Countess of Wessex, have been spending more time with the Queen since Philip\u0027s retirement.For a while there has been a \u0027granny rota\u0027 for the grandchildren, who make sure they are around more, especially at teatime.          The Queen at the wheel of her Range Rover. She and Philip have settled into a new rhythm of married life since her husband retired from official duties A similar rota is in place for Prince Philip — he loves to see his oldest grandson, Peter Phillips, and his daughter Princess Anne. But he enjoys his own company, too.Always a voracious reader — he is the only royal with his own library at Buckingham Palace — he especially likes history and military books. (One friend spotted a copy of one of the historian Antony Beevor\u0027s books about World War II on a recent visit.)\u0027He reads to learn — that\u0027s why he doesn\u0027t particularly like novels,\u0027 says a friend.Philip also still paints and — when the weather is good — likes to set his easel and watercolours in the garden.He has even developed some new pastimes the truffle plantation he established as an experiment back in 2006 is finally yielding its rich fruit and he likes to follow its progress. Of course, he is never truly alone. Even at Wood Farm, he is attended by one of his two pages, a footman, chef, housekeeper, valet and his police protectors. But unlike at the Palace, where they would be in liveried costume, Philip insists they dress casually in \u0027civvies\u0027.From time to time a private secretary will come up from London and the two will work through the considerable correspondence that still arrives for him.And he loves to have visitors. His carriage-driving friend Countess Mountbatten is a regular house guest.When Philip is at Windsor, it means that he and the Queen see much more of each other.For a man in his tenth decade, he is also remarkably considerate in not dragging people such as his hairdresser to Windsor, instead driving to London to see him.Retirement has removed many of the restrictions of royal life that Philip found so chafing. Losing the ability to drive himself would certainly be a blow, but he would not see it as the end of the world.As long as he can still clamber onto a carriage and take the reins of his ponies, Philip will continue to live life to the full. "},{"url":null,"title":"Is end embossed bank card","story":"    Banks such as NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland are ditching the raised font in favour of slimline cards, which are said to be more durable and easier to read (file image)However, this is now done digitally – so raised numbers are no longer necessary. Trim debit cards are being sent to current account customers at NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland after the group trialled the design with premier account holders.A brochure sent to customers reads: \u0027Your unembossed card may look and feel different, but it works just like your old card and is just as secure.\u0027With flat print, you will find that your account information is easier to read and the card will last longer.\u0027Policeman shot in the face and female colleague in the neck...EXCLUSIVE: I got you babe!

Mrs Clarke also admitted that Barnardo\u0027s staff had been encouraged to take children they were looking after home with them Some staff had been poorly trained and lacking experience, with limited time off, coping with children with behavioural problems, meaning children were starved of emotional care.Mrs Clarke also admitted that Barnardo\u0027s staff had been encouraged to take children they were looking after home with them on occasion for weekends or nights away, leading to an allegation that one boy was raped by his male carer.Asked by Mr Peoples if the concept of risk assessment had been \u0027primitive\u0027 in the 1970s and 1980s, Mrs Clarke said: \u0027It was not well-developed, I would have to say.\u0027She said staff were not always aware of the risk of staff being abusers, adding: \u0027It was a different mindset… you did not go around looking at every situation as a potentially risky situation.\u0027Mrs Clarke said abuse had taken place because of \u0027ignorance\u0027 and \u0027denial\u0027, and it was only controversies such as the Jimmy Savile scandal which showed that abusers could be \u0027hiding in plain sight\u0027.And she said a growing trend for single men to work in care homes for children had left youngsters open to the risk of sexual abuse in \u0027closed environments\u0027, by staff who had not been subject to robust vetting.Asked by SCAI chairman Lady Smith if staff \u0027just got used to certain types of conduct and ceased questioning themselves\u0027, Mrs Clarke said there was \u0027certainly far less scrutiny of process and far less openness and discussion\u0027.Mr Peoples said Barnardo\u0027s had claimed in a submission to the inquiry that it believed there was \u0027no pattern or underlying theme that would identify a systemic failure\u0027.Questioned if this could be the case, given the evidence the inquiry had heard, Mrs Clarke said \u0027Barnardo\u0027s has never shied away from history\u0027, and had been fully committed to the work of the inquiry.She said: \u0027In general, the practice was good and in some areas progressive, but clearly through Barnardo\u0027s history there have been times in certain homes and in certain eras where children were let down, and Barnardo\u0027s failed to protect them, and as a result they experienced abuse\u0027.Mrs Clarke said: \u0027Whether that was a systemic failing is a bit more difficult to answer.\u0027She said the systems in place to look after children were \u0027good for the time\u0027 and the charity had been \u0027committed to improving and constantly looking at things and trying to make things better\u0027.But she added there were \u0027occasions\u0027 where children were \u0027let down\u0027, adding: \u0027Barnardo\u0027s realises that and are deeply sorry for any hurt to any child that came through the care of Barnardo\u0027s\u0027.Asked by Mr Peoples if Barnardo\u0027s was accepting that there were \u0027failures by the organisation\u0027, Mrs Clarke said: \u0027Yes.\u0027The inquiry continues."},{"url":null,"title":"Could pothole payout FINALLY make councils fix roads","story":"    Lawyer Clive Thorp, 68, of Selsey, West Sussex, brought a small claims court case against his council which refused to pay out after his car was damaged for a third time in two years by a pothole on the same stretch of road (file image)Judges said ‘defects which represent an immediate or imminent hazard’ should be ‘corrected or made safe’ at the time of the inspection.

Mr Thorp stressed: ‘I’m very cross that the public are being fobbed off by local authorities when they should know what the law is.‘The council says it is acting legally as long as it has a system in place to deal with repairs but that is not what the law says.‘Their idea – that potholes should be repaired within 28 days – is not good enough. A motorist or cyclist could be killed in that time. The case law needs to be used to force local authorities to act and save lives.’Mr Thorp took his case via the online fast-track small claims court service, based in Northampton.He said: ‘People often give up when they are knocked back by their local council and everyone seems frightened of going to the law – but it only cost me £25.’Recent cases of cyclists being killed by potholes include Carolyn Dumbleton, 52, from Lincoln, who died after being thrown from her bike in Derbyshire last year.Triathlete Kate Vanloo, also 52, died in 2016 after her bicycle hit a pothole hidden by a puddle and she was thrown into the path of a car.Campaign group Cycling UK has said 400 cyclists have been killed or injured by potholes since 2007.Roger Lawson, of the Association of British Drivers, said West Sussex Council should have fixed the pothole in Mr Thorp’s case ‘as soon as possible’. ‘If it’s left for weeks, that’s not good enough,’ he insisted.Luke Bosdet, of the AA, added: ‘If it’s a known pothole and a vehicle is damaged by it, councils should pay compensation. The fact the council has scheduled a repair is no basis for defence.’A West Sussex County Council spokesman said yesterday: ‘We consider all compensation claims on their own merits to ensure they are dealt with fairly.’ "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2982bba8e5ac2f4080ef8a473815882420d46163/2096_1081_2876_1726/master/2876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1da109341862fe4ef4f850907a9181ef","title":"hardeep pandhal artist paranoid picnic colonial identity","story":"His cartoon creations unravelling identity and empire have made him a rising star. Now he’s going global – and taking Punjabi lessons so he can speak to his nearest and dearestYou can learn a lot about Hardeep Pandhal from the title of his new solo exhibition, Paranoid Picnic: The Phantom BAME. There’s the ever-present wordplay, the tense yet humorous relationship to race and identity, and even a reference to the Glasgow-based artist’s taste in video games (Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is known for having an absurdist streak amid its violence).Pandhal describes the show as “straddling” two Nottingham art venues: Primary – a repurposed school building that suits Pandhal’s DIY approach – and the more typical, white-walled New Art Exchange. That term could also apply to his work, which straddles the complexities of identity as a British-Indian man. For Pandal, identity is rife with conflict, but also something he approaches with an acidic sense of humour, to poke holes in the tension.His drawings and animations feature the recurring image of the sepoy – locally recruited soldiers in British-ruled colonial India – rendered as absurd caricatures in Pandhal’s psychedelic, half-melted hand-drawn style. On a new animation that gives the exhibition its title, Pandhal repeatedly raps the phrase “Paki visionary”, angrily appropriating the racial slur in a moment of self-aggrandisement. It’s the sort of ego we might expect to hear from any number of mainstream rappers, but one that’s also self-aware and critical. He knows that, as an artist of Indian heritage, he’s likely to be labelled in certain ways that white artists would not be, and that his work will be expected to hold the special “cultural signifi-cunts” he alludes to in his rap.Rapping has increasingly become an outlet for Pandhal, whose loose flow hangs over his work, giving a window into his way of thinking. “It’s economical and it’s fun,” states the artist.2018 was undoubtedly a big year for Pandhal. He was nominated for the Film London Jarman award, and included in high-profile international exhibitions such as the New Museum Triennial in New York. He was also one of the few locally based artists to make it into the main programme for Glasgow International. “It was flattering to be involved,” he says. “It’s good for facilitating, supporting and allowing various different approaches to exist, it’s something that isn’t really paralleled elsewhere.”Pandhal is reflective when it comes to his home. “Living in Glasgow, architecturally, there’s this presence,” he states, referring to the Victorian buildings and monuments that are a common sight throughout the city, yet a constant reminder of the legacy of the British empire and colonialism. This has partly inspired in Pandhal a desire to connect more with India and its art scene he has already made tentative steps via his presentation with Jhaveri Contemporary of Mumbai at London’s 2018 Frieze art fair.Such a move also relates to a long-held desire to connect more with his mother. Pandhal grew up with English as his first language, while his mother speaks Punjabi, preventing them from being able to fully communicate with one another. Pandhal wants 2019 to be the year that he becomes fluent in Punjabi, and he also hopes to continue an artistic collaboration with his mother that has seen him altering and embroidering clothing that she makes, creating an exchange between parent and child that they aren’t able to express to each other through language.Despite this barrier to communication, Pandhal says his parents have always remained supportive – if a little bemused – by his art career. “With bits of press and my presence online, they can get a sense that I’m involved in something and it’s making me happy,” he says, noting that some of his peers who had the potential to find success at art school were pushed away from it by their parents. Despite their work together, Pandhal says his mother is not likely to be joining him as an artist any time soon. “She makes all of her clothes, so that’s quite normal for her,” he says. “To her it’s not art and it’s not a collaboration.”• Paranoid Picnic: The Phantom Bame is at New Art Exchange and Primary, Nottingham, 19 January-17 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a48a00b59625d2e84a77fb586f1bb437b98ae0b1/0_0_4134_2726/master/4134.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=af1277389202b5d6a606edefdbcc86cb 2020w","title":"great australian heatwave takes a breather only to return again soon","story":"Late monsoon and lack of strong cold fronts cited as main reasons behind back-to-back spells of abnormally hot weatherThis week’s record-smashing heatwave is over for now in Australia’s south-east, but the reprieve will be short-lived as temperatures build up again in the coming days.A perfect storm, or rather the lack of one, is partly to blame for the extreme temperatures, with neither the northern monsoons nor the southern cool fronts making their usual appearances.“For pretty much most locations in the southern part of Australia, the heatwave is over,” said the Bureau of Meteorology meteorologist Dean Narramore.“So it should be a much cooler weekend for many areas, but then we’ll start seeing the heat return at least in Adelaide as we move into Monday, back into the high 30s.“The rest of South Australia will be much much hotter, getting into the mid 40s probably from around Tuesday.”Perth is expected to reach 39 to 40C, and the inland area will have temperatures in the low-to-mid 40s, which will then head east.Melbourne would possibly reach 40C later in the week, he added.Parts of the country were still hot on Saturday, reaching 42.1C in Bourke, New South Wales, and 42.5C in Birdsville, Queensland.Temperatures in Menindee, the site of devastating mass fish kills, were hovering a few degrees below 30C after hitting 47C on Wednesday and Thursday.The Bureau of Meteorology was still analysing the heatwave event, but Narramore said it appeared that the last week had been “one of the biggest and most intense heatwaves we’ve seen in a long time”.He estimated that at least 20 records had been broken.Previous climate change analysis by the CSIRO and BoM has found that every part of Australia will see increasingly longer hot spells, rises in average temperature, and more frequent hot days. Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will continue to climb.According to the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO, Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910, and temperatures will increase in the future.So how will climate change affect future heatwaves in Australia?The CSIRO and BoM have compiled different models for predicting the outcome of climate change in Australia to produce a guide to how different regions will likely be affected.They found that every part of Australia will continue to experience increases in average temperature, and will have a higher frequency of hot days.The duration of hot spells will increase in every region. In many areas in the northern half of Australia, the average number of days above 35C could increase by two to three times.Late in the century, towns such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Broome\u0026nbsp may experience days with temperatures above 35C for about a third of the year.These higher temperatures will also result in higher evaporation, which will continue to make drought conditions worse.Temperature records were broken across the country over the past week, and Australia’s highest ever overnight minimum was recorded in Noona at 35.9C.In South Australia, Tarcoola and Port Augusta had their hottest days on record (49C and 48.9C respectively), and the NSW town of Tibooburra had its highest minimum temperature on record of 34.2C.Canberra had four consecutive days above the 40C mark and Broken Hill had three – both for the first time in recorded history.The already hot central desert region also experienced record heat, although not worse than the last heatwave. Ernabella set a new high at 44.5C.At midday on Saturday, there were 68 fires burning across NSW with 26 uncontained, the state’s rural fire service said. Fire bans remained in place across parts of the state.In the Northern Territory, firefighters worked to put out a blaze at Standley Chasm on Friday, which closed roads and several sections of the Larapinta trail.The bureau’s last climate statement noted that December had Australia’s warmest Christmas Day and Boxing Day on record.Narramore said there were two main reasons for the back-to-back heatwaves.“One is the very late monsoon, which normally covers northern Australia with clouds and showers, and cools the top of the country down. So the air continues to heat up over weeks and months,” he said.“The other reason is no strong cold fronts over southern Australia, which would normally flush out the hot air.“So there’s no relief up north and no relief down south … we need the monsoon to kick in or a nice front.”Authorities warned people to stay hydrated and check in on family and neighbours, particularly the elderly, as the heat returned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2081a9cf431342fb56f5e2ab9684a8230ae0b315/0_325_5117_3070/master/5117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81b41f0be6140ecf59b81494b18035b1","title":"why the term twitch is ruffling feathers","story":"News of a ‘mega-twitch’ near Melbourne may lead you to ask why avian enthusiasts are called ‘twitchers’ – and why do some ‘birders’ look down on them?This week bird-watchers thronged to a sewage-treatment plant near Melbourne in order to get a look at a monochrome duck. One of them counted “35 cars of birders”, adding: “It was a mega-twitch.”A “twitch” here is what “twitchers” engage in: the pursuit of a previously located rare bird. But why this term? It might be plausible to relate it to the sense of “to twitch” meaning to pluck or snatch, or the twitching of bushes and twigs by ill-concealed watchers, but a letter to British Birds magazine in 1983 is the canonical source.There, one Bob Emmett explained how, in the 1950s, he would give his friend Howard Medhurst a ride on the back of his motorcycle when their gang went off to spot birds. At the destination Medhurst would “totter off the back” and “shiveringly light up a cigarette”. Since everyone was excited, the others began to imitate his jerky movements, and travelling to see a rare bird became “to go on a twitch”.Some serious “birders” think twitchers are just sensationalist box-tickers, but happily there is room enough in the world for both styles of avian admiration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36c152a9ec5d8cc5b442e1fab23350e2c83dff61/0_282_5378_3226/master/5378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8653e0f7986768ccd36bfb2ed650680","title":"patisserie valerie locked in talks over banking lifeline","story":"A standstill of the chain’s banking facilities was set to expire on Friday nightThe cake and cafe chain Patisserie Valerie was locked in talks about securing a lifeline from its banks on Friday after saying it had uncovered “significant manipulation” of its books.A standstill of the group’s banking facilities, protecting it from action to recover debts, was set to expire on Friday night. The company, which has previously said it wanted to extend the standstill to last a year, had been expected to make an announcement before the market closed in London, but talks had not finished.The business, which operates 200 cafes and employs 3,000 staff, said earlier this week it had hired the advisory firm KPMG to consider all options, raising speculation it could be facing insolvency, mass store closures or a debt-for-equity swap.In a statement to the stock market on Wednesday, Patisserie Valerie said it was now clear that profits would be “materially below” the estimated £12m when the company first flagged fears of fraud in October.

Johnson was paid back £10m after other shareholders later put up £15m in new funds.Another shareholder expressed shock that a business which had been expected to make profits of close to £30m this year was now likely to make less than £6m. “The discrepancy from where we were to where we are now is massive for such a small company,” he said.Shareholders in Patisserie Valerie, which was valued at £450m before its profits “black hole” was uncovered, are braced for considerable losses.

He charts the city’s burgeoning style sceneAlongside its golden beaches, glitzy nightclubs and vibrant music scene, Senegal’s capital, Dakar, is emerging as a key African fashion hub.The breezy seaside city, located on the continent’s westernmost point, is “west Africa’s centre of style”, according to the January issue of National Geographic Traveler magazine, which ranked it at No 1 on its list of urban hotspots. The New York Times this week included it on a list of 52 places to visit in 2019, saying Dakar is “bursting with positive energy” and that local “design and fashion creations would fit right in at New York showrooms”.The strength of the city’s fashion scene has long been apparent, even if it is only now gaining notice. I moved to Dakar in 2005 and spent nearly a decade based there as a newswire photographer covering stories across Africa. The role often meant documenting wars, coups and disasters, but Senegal always remained a haven of peace and relative tranquillity in an often-tumultuous region.My eye was drawn to its vibrant colours and designs and, over the years, I photographed fashion around town. The city’s youth blend a deep respect for the traditional, flowing boubous worn for special occasions with cutting-edge styles of their own.Senegal has a well-educated middle class and an Instagram generation that embraces African and American fashions, creating an elegant and athletic style of bling and beauty.Dakar now rivals Johannesburg, Lagos, Nairobi and Casablanca at the forefront of African fashion, with much of its energy driven by the designer Adama Ndiaye, the 40-year-old organiser of Dakar fashion week and a number of other international African fashion week events.“When I started it was a young girl’s dream to build something in my country,” Ndiaye says.Launched 17 years ago, Dakar fashion week initially had only a handful of aspiring local designers and models gathering in often rundown hotels. Now dozens of designers from around the world present their creations to thumping DJ mixes as drone cameras hover above runway shows broadcast live on national television.One of Ndiaye’s friends is Jenke Ahmed Tailly, an Ivorian and Senegalese stylist who works as Beyoncé’s creative director and also advises Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. At the Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 charity concert in South Africa last month, Beyoncé wore one of Ndiaye’s creations, a Boyette bag, based on the nomadic Tuareg style of embossed leather boxes.Africa’s fashion scene has grown steadily over the past two decades, with sub-Saharan Africa’s apparel and footwear market now worth $31bn, according to data by Euromonitor. Industry challenges include managing clothing production costs, quality control, distribution logistics and reaching large markets.Such challenges are far from the minds of most Senegalese, whose most pressing fashion concerns involve choosing the right outfit and looking their best wherever they’re headed.This is a selection of images reflecting the variety of Dakar styles and fashion events I’ve photographed over the years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4cf015e47ee3a1cae116fce41db872a7b0fe35/0_13_3483_2090/master/3483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c89f093245dec29527364ec6496e1db0","title":"brexit climate change yemen gaza irish backstop","story":"One of Brexit’s more pernicious aspects, even before you get to its actual flaws, is its tendency to suck all available oxygen unto itself, to drain resources that might otherwise have gone elsewhere. Before the referendum, civil servants warned that such a task – untangling 40 years of legal agreements, ripping out a delicate web of connections that had become embedded – would consume all their energies. Naturally, their warnings were dismissed as Project Fear. But even the head of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, before he took on the form of Benedict Cumberbatch, conceded via Twitter that leaving the European Union would present the British state with the “hardest job since beating Nazis”.Just think of what else we could have done with all that time and money, including the £4bn we’re spending to guard against the entirely avoidable and self-inflicted calamity of a no-deal crash-out from the EU. The effort we could have made for jobs or housing, or to repair the damage inflicted by austerity the work that could have been done to improve life for those left behind by three decades of change, globalisation and automation. But Whitehall didn’t have the bandwidth. Governments might be able to walk and chew gum at the same time, but walking while shooting yourself in both feet – that, it turns out, is impossible.It’s not just the machinery of state that has seized up since June 2016, all but paralysed by Brexit. It’s affected what you might call the attention economy too: both the news media and its consumers, those who shape the collective conversation and those who take part in it. So enveloped are we in Brexit that we hardly have the space to contemplate anything else. Our gaze is turned inward, and we can barely see what’s going on around us.Perhaps it’s harsh to blame Brexit for our apathy about climate change, which long predates the 2016 referendum. But even those subjects that we used to discuss barely get a look-in now. The war in Syria rages on. This week, as MPs were debating their confidence in Theresa May, the UN reported that at least 15 infants, including eight babies, had died for lack of medical care and from extreme cold. Most of their families had fled the fighting to seek refuge on the Jordanian border. It’s a reminder that the world has not stopped turning just because we’ve stopped looking.Perhaps it’s giving ourselves too much credit, but I’d like to think that, were we not so distracted by the customs union and Norway plus, we would at least have registered that China is currently holding an estimated 1 million Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region in what seem to be Mao-style “re-education camps”. Forced to listen to hours of Communist party propaganda aimed at their “rehabilitation and redemption”, inmates are held in squalid conditions and subject to brutal interrogations. There are reports of prisoners taking what, in their despair, they conclude is the only way out: suicide. One former captive describes being held still in a “metal device” that kept him entirely rigid. That rather puts our debates about “free movement” into perspective, doesn’t it?The Chinese authorities call these places, which satellite photographs reveal have dramatically expanded, “vocational training centres”. But they are behind barbed wire and high perimeter walls. The authorities say they inoculate “trainees” against the lure of terrorism. The truth is they represent state persecution of a reviled religious minority. The historical resonances are obvious, and should have provoked fierce condemnation from our leaders. But they, and we, are all too busy.Even those stories that not long ago commanded our attention now struggle to be noticed. Last year, Israel’s use of live ammunition against protesters at the Gaza frontier rightly made big news, as did the presence of antisemitism within Labour’s ranks. You might imagine both issues had faded away, given how rarely they’re now discussed. But the Gaza protests continue and the anguish of daily life there has not receded: witness, by way of an exception, Mishal Husain’s BBC report from a hospital struggling to function.Meanwhile, every day brings fresh evidence that within Labour’s ranks there remain some deeply suspect attitudes toward Jews: note the Labour councillor in Fife who reckoned concerns about anti-Jewish racism were all part of a Mossad-orchestrated plot – in other words, a Jewish conspiracy. She was briefly suspended but is now safely back in the Labour fold.Or you could look to the United States, where the former Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has admitted sharing polling data with the Russians – as slam-dunk a proof of collusion as you could wish for. So conclusive is it that Trump’s own lawyer, the once credible Rudy Giuliani, has reversed his previous line of defence: now he all but admits there was collusion, but says Trump himself was not involved. It’s all happening out there, but our minds are elsewhere. It means we don’t even have to wait to leave the European Union to see that the notion that Brexit would forge a global Britain, eager to head “out and into the world” was bogus. We can already see that it’s doing the opposite to us, turning our gaze ever more inward, shrinking our horizons – and ourselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27de6cf23d0cd341854c15e51f7113b91e88a0ca/41_0_2395_1437/master/2395.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2567ab36e4c4a9841be1e16c9a5814e7","title":"cheering no deal question time brexit","story":"In an encounter with a Question Time audience in Derby I tried to explain that Brexit is no ordinary transactionThere are moments in life when your heart sinks. I had one last night, right at the start of my terrifying debut on Question Time. Isabel Oakeshott had just said we should leave the EU with no deal. And the audience cheered. Not a subdued, start-of-the-evening, not-quite-warmed-up cheer. But a roar. A loud one. Shit, I thought. Do I dare point out the problems with this? Because there are problems aplenty.Metaphors matter. And Brexit has become a metaphorical cornucopia (if you see what I mean). Perhaps nowhere is this more true, and more damagingly and misleadingly so, than when it comes to the question of “no deal”.When you hear the phrase, it’s natural to think of some kind of commercial exchange. So, for example, I’ve decided to trade my old car in. I take it to the garage to part-exchange it, and the person makes me an offer I can easily refuse. So I drive the old car home.That’s a no deal, but it is absolutely not a good analogy for Brexit. In commerce, as a rule, the default outcome – the situation if no transaction takes place – is the status quo ante. No deal, no change. With Brexit, if we leave the European Union with no deal, we don’t simply carry on as before. Far from it.What will happen instead is that a whole swathe of rules governing all manner of transactions with the EU – covering, among other things, travel, security cooperation and trade – will cease to apply. Losing chunks of law isn’t easy pointing this out isn’t “Project Fear”. This will be disruptive, and there’s no point claiming otherwise. Thinking, “Sod it, it’s been almost three years, let’s just leave” is fair enough, but be aware of what it means.And, yes, the government is trying to put in place plans to minimise disruption. But let’s be clear about these. The fact we’re planning to park lorries that previously would have been moving is not avoiding disruption, it’s managing it. And there is simply not enough time for the government to make all the preparations – infrastructure, hiring staff etc – it needs to.Insofar as no deal is something that can be planned for, moreover, it’s not enough for us to do it alone. The EU member states have to do it, too. And, yes, the EU has put in place some contingency plans. But again, not only are these limited, but they are designed, not unreasonably, to minimise upheaval on the other side of the Channel. Plans to keep planes in the air make sense, but don’t be surprised that these don’t include provisions to allow British Airways the same rights as before. And the EU 27 have reserved the right to withdraw these measures at any time.Which brings us to another, possibly more important, limitation of the deal metaphor. This is politics, not commerce. And politics is, sometimes, about more than the bottom line. Yes, no deal will hurt the EU, too. But not only do they know it will hurt us more, but they seem willing (not keen, just willing) to tolerate whatever harm it does them.The EU has pledged to ensure the rights of EU citizens here, and to make sure Brexit does not lead to a border in Ireland. Those priorities remain the same. So, if we leave with no deal, don’t expect them to sit down with us to chat about trade. They will say: “Get back to us when you’re ready to sort the issues we thought we’d resolved with the deal you’ve rejected.” All the more so because that deal includes us paying them nearly £40bn.All this being said, and contrary to my worst fears, when I tried, nervously, to explain all of this to the audience in Derby, they didn’t heckle. They didn’t shout me down. They paid attention. Some caricature leavers as a bunch of ignorant oiks waiting to drown out arguments they don’t like that’s certainly not a view I have any time for.I’m not kidding myself that I changed any minds. There’s plenty of evidence out there to suggest there’s not much mind changing at all going on around Brexit. But I’m grateful to the audience, an audience that obviously had strong feelings, for having the decency to at least listen.• Anand Menon is director of The UK in a Changing Europe, and professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London.

Really?For better or for worse, one of post-imperial Britain’s favoured methods of understanding itself has been through the prism of the royal family. We come together at royal weddings and jubilees, some like to say, while others do so in front of box sets of The Crown. Brexit, on the other hand, has long been a straight-up car metaphor. Cars are far and away the most popular way of understanding what might be happening to us. Remainers warn of “a car being driven off a cliff” or of Theresa May “running out of road” Brexiteers talk of “taking the wheel” and “the open road”.Sensationally, these two streams have crossed (DON’T CROSS THE STREAMS!) in the matter of Prince Philip’s road accident. The crash – widely believed to have been orchestrated by Mohamed Al Fayed and MI6, though you won’t read that in the mainstream media – comes at a moment of high Brexit drama. And looking at HRH’s upturned vehicle, I wonder what its import can be, other than that certain things might be regarded as recklessly beyond the capabilities of our decrepit political system?Then again, lesser vehicle analogies are available. Boris Johnson dragged Her Majesty’s press to the JCB headquarters in Staffordshire this morning, where he stood in front of a digger and pummelled the metaphor like it was a journalist asking questions about one of his criminal schoolfriends. Bros before backhoes, innit.If you’re keeping a tally of such things, the two significant political figures most determined to mainstream that toxic Trump staple, the “deep state”, are Jeremy Corbyn’s senior aide, Andrew Murray – who invoked the deep state over two issues last September – and now Boris Johnson. Conclude from that what you will, but your answer should include the epithet “Bannon-frotters”.Optimists may feel able to dismiss Johnson as a Chinese restaurant’s Churchill impersonator, but to watch him lie remorselessly in Staffordshire was to be reminded that he is still something far more sinister. It remains disturbing to see the media held captive in Buffalo Boris’s well, while he leers his terrible catchphrases down at them. “It writes the article or it gets the hose …” Johnson has been sewing the pieces of his prime minister suit together for such a long time now the prospect of him getting to wear it has yet to be eliminated.But what of the prime minister who Johnson is angling to replace? On Wednesday night, Theresa May treated us to yet another of those occasions where she emerges out of the No 10 door in signature angular fashion, says precisely nothing of substance, then jerks back in again. How many episodes of this show are there going to be? Far be it from me to criticise the Bagpuss producers, but the decision to spin off the character of Professor Yaffle’s wife isn’t really working.In the wake of her promise to reach out in “constructive spirit” and “work harder at taking parliament with us”, No 10 let it be known that the only things May isn’t flexible on are a second referendum, a customs union, a single market, extending article 50, or dropping the threat of no deal. She’ll do anything for love, but she won’t do that, or that, or that, or that. Those. The point is: she’s changed.That said, Jeremy Corbyn’s decision not to accept the cattle-prod May has graciously extended to him misunderstands the theatre. Corbyn prides himself on his historic success in keeping dialogue open during the Troubles, for instance, even though this vital role isn’t acknowledged in any of the significant books about these events. Like Steven Seagal in Under Siege 2, Corbyn’s “got medals that are so secret he can never show them to anybody”.For her part, May has decided to capitalise on the impasse by sending Corbyn a long and intense letter about being ghosted. Do print all these out as they come, and you can burn them for warmth in the event of no deal. In the meantime, May has until Monday evening to come up with a workable plan B.On that note, you might have been surprised to read a well-briefed story on the front of the Times today, revealing that she will block a future peerage for Speaker John Bercow, on the basis of his growing taste for shithousery (I paraphrase slightly). To which the only response can be: is Brexit over? No, but is it? Are we actually in the sunlit uplands and none of us noticed? Because I think we all want confirmation that every last agreement has been nailed down and every last bonanza trade deal has been signed before No 10 spends one pissing second of its dwindling time briefing about whether ermine will or will not be forthcoming, for anyone, at some unspecified point in the future.Is anyone trying to get on top of plan B? According to reports, it’s David Lidington. The entity always described as “the de facto deputy prime minister” is apparently holding talks with senior opposition politicians, along with Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay – also believed to be an urban myth – and Michael Gove.The latter, of course, we are aware of, which makes his shortening leadership odds all the more eyecatching. In the immediate wake of the referendum, you will recall, Michael’s actions were regarded as the Tories’ personal knife-crime problem. After he backstabbed his Vote Leave buddy Boris Johnson, Michael’s behaviour was widely regarded as too disgusting for the Conservative party. Indeed, it was helpful to note Boris Johnson giving a shout-out to Northern Powerhouse minister Jake Berry in his speech this morning, because Berry’s only other claim to fame has been two July 2016 tweets reading, “I do not for one moment resile from my opinion that as a traitor Gove leaves Judas Iscariot standing”, and “there is a very deep pit reserved in hell for such as he. #Gove.” Well. We all live in that pit now, and “Safehands” Gove is being touted by some as our best hope for avoiding a deeper one. Farce could easily repeat itself as history.Ah yes, history. In the run-up to the predictably vast defeat of her withdrawal deal on Tuesday night, May was in full delusional mode. “When the history books are written,” she hazarded, “people will ask: did we deliver on the vote to leave? Or did we deliver for the economy and security?” Ah. I hate to travel back from the future with spoilers, but the history books end up making this period of British history a sealed section. Its contents are deemed too spectacularly grotesque to consume without a warning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/582109ebe7716eb40b7cdce7077d35b3cd067a2f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78da4e00afb718ef0f61428ac7dae0e5","title":"cotswolds river history windrush titanic grenfell","story":"A spark or flame can raise a name from obscurity to renown or ignominy – or come to identify a whole generationSometime in 1983, a friendly chain of events not untypical of India took me to a shipping office in Kolkata, there to meet the nephew of an Anglo-Indian woman I had met quite casually a month or two earlier in Bihar. It was dusk. The office was in a large, gloomy building by the river. Unshaded bulbs shed a yellow light on walls decorated with calendars from companies that made ceiling fans and water pumps, but there was also a picture of a ship with a black and white funnel and a bow wave creasing a blue sea. “SS Nuddea” said the caption.Nuddea! It had been a big name in my childhood. My father had sailed on an earlier Nuddea owned by the same shipping line, the British-India Steam Navigation Company, and the family album had pictures of him aboard in his white tropical uniform. Not a very smart ship, one of the workaday N-class (Nerbudda, Nowshera) that tramped slowly to Australia and back my father had wanted a berth on one of the bigger M-class (Madura, Modasa) that took passengers as well as cargo. Nevertheless, I had thought proudly of the Nuddea as “Daddy’s ship”, and never imagined that the name could represent anything beyond a cargo steamer built in Glasgow in 1919.It did, of course, as the names given to all made things – ships, tower blocks, streets, aircraft and locomotives – usually do. Nuddea, these days spelled Nadia, is a district in northern Bengal. My new friend in the shipping office said it was easy to reach. Some weeks later I took a broad‑gauge train from Kolkata, then a narrow-gauge train from a junction, then a boat across a smooth, dark river to reach what turned out to be one of Nadia’s chief attractions: the world headquarters of the Hare Krishna movement, which offered me a room for the night.The movement’s large presence in Nadia wasn’t an accident. The great Hindu mystic and saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was born in the district under a neem tree in the 15th century, and it was his musical, processional style of devotion, bhakti, that the Hare Krishnas had adopted and made globally recognisable as their own in the first decade or two after their organisation’s foundation in the 1960s in New York.Other important events had happened in Nadia. Robert Clive had won a victory here at Plassey (now Palashi) that made the British the rulers of Bengal one of Nadia’s towns, Nabadwip, had once been the Bengali capital its scholarly traditions had made it known as “the Oxford of Bengal”, or so the gazetteer said. Lying on my mattress and listening to the chants of “Hare Rama, Hare Krishna”, I thought that, of all the people in the world who knew of NuddeaNadia, I would be the only one for whom the word summoned a picture of a steamer loading sugar at a pier in Queensland in 1929 or a young marine engineer smiling at the camera somewhere east of Suez in the same year – images that would now live with memories of the huge pots of steaming rice and dal that had contained that night’s communal dinner.But some names allow fewer connotations, a great or terrible event wiping out all previous meaning. “Titanic” is one of these – a name seemingly designed for hubris, though less obviously so before April 1912. Another is “Windrush”, which until the 1940s was a word confined to the 35-mile-long river that rises in the Cotswolds and joins the Thames near Oxford. In Anglo-Saxon documents it appears as Uuenrisc, Wænric, Wenric and Wenris – a very English name that was as far from the mind of the crowd gathered at a Hamburg shipyard in December 1930 as “crumpet” or “toasting fork” when the motor vessel Monte Rosa went down the slipway.The ship was the last of five sisters built for the Hamburg Süd line to a design originally intended for the expected rush of German migrants to South America. But the rush never materialised, and the Monte Rosa spent the prewar years cruising in the North Sea under the management, after Hitler came to power, of the Nazi “strength through joy” programme of strenuous exercise and cheap holidays.The ship’s wartime career included roles as a support vessel for the battleship Tirpitz and as a transport taking Norwegian Jews towards Auschwitz and, later, German refugees fleeing the westward advance of the Red Army. It was bombed by the RAF and limpet-mined by the Royal Navy. Here was a ship that embodied the great tragedies of the 20th century, but manages to be famous for something else entirely.Captured at Kiel, the Monte Rosa was among several German liners put to work by the UK Ministry of Transport as troopships. “Empire” was the ministry’s standard prefix for its ship names. A ministry official decided that the German liners needed a small category of their own and would be named after rivers. It was a strange and whimsical mixture: Empire Fowey, Empire Halladale, Empire Ken and Empire Orwell – rivers respectively in Cornwall, Sutherland, Scotland, India and East Anglia. And there was, of course, a fifth, when the Monte Rosa was renamed after the Thames tributary that has since become an adjective for a generation of Caribbean migrants.There is no planning for posterity in these things. An accident – a spark, a flame – can raise a name from obscurity to renown or ignominy. In 1859 a young man born into a prosperous Buckinghamshire family purchased his commission in the 60th Rifles and, after an uneventful early career – that phrase is from his entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography – began to play his part in the expansion and defence of British imperial interests in Africa.From 1875 to the end of the century he took part in all sorts of expeditions and campaigns, some of which are obscure now to everyone except, perhaps, the descendants of the defeated: against the Galeka tribe and the Gaika tribe (“which ended with their rout in the Gwili Gwili Mountains”) against the Zulus and the Mahdists in command of the Anglo-Egyptian forces at the battles of Giniss, Suakin and Toski.In 1899 he was appointed governor of Malta, and in 1908 a field marshal. The ODNB records that until his death in 1925 “he devoted himself to the Church Lads’ Brigade, the Royal Horticultural Society, of which he was president, and to various other voluntary services … He received many honours: military, academic, and civic.”Francis Wallace Grenfell GCMG, First Baron Grenfell: one of his civic honours came from the Royal Borough of Kensington, which named a road after him. In the 1970s the council built a 24-storey tower next to the road and gave it the same name. Now when we read the word we know what we see. Like Titanic and Windrush (and Elvis, Diana and Boris), the reality it brings to mind is everywhere the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe25aff5c5cff57a70c2acd4c9723357f6df786e/1221_1086_4032_2420/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a2dc823ecf9d34b4bdb0cbae1cdeea6","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Puerto Rican parrots, a tufted duck and a giant panda feature in this week’s gallery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a6b33d1434d0ae2345335c7677a21868ba34b00/0_162_4838_2902/master/4838.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c253ae1f10ffc3acb38cfbd31083f8b8","title":"dior shows the suit is back as tailoring outweighs sportswear","story":"Kim Jones focuses on ‘architectural tailoring’ – even at a ready-to-wear showIn Paris, the suit is back. Or is at least attempting a comeback.It was always going to be high on the agenda at Dior, which showed its autumnwinter show on Friday night. Artistic director Kim Jones might be the man who spliced tailoring with streetwear at Louis Vuitton, most notably in his 2017 collaboration with Supreme, but for his second collection at the fashion house he focused on “architectural tailoring”, drawing heavily on the label’s couture heritage – despite this being a ready-to-wear show.“It’s about reaffirming Dior with lots of tailoring … except with this spirit of now,” he said the evening before the show.Yet elsewhere on the Paris catwalks this week, tailoring has outweighed sportswear for the first time in several seasons. Both Dries Van Noten and Berluti closed their shows with civilised black suits, but even Vetements, king of subversive anti-fashion, and Louis Vuitton’s Virgil Abloh, king of streetwear, opened their shows with a handful of princely tailoring.The Dior show took place in a giant black box within the Champ de Mars park, behind the Eiffel Tower. Inside, the models were static, carried along a 76 metre conveyor belt designed to look like a salon show on a giant scale.This tableaux vivant replicated the statues outside, but was chosen because Jones thinks it is the “nicest way” to display a suit. It also photographs well, proving that even in an industry which sets its clock by social media Jones knows what he is doing. That some wore tabards and vests gave it an Action Man feel, although this was accidental.“The armour is not a reference to what’s going on at the moment in politics here,” he said. “We were looking at that reference six months ago. It’s my third collection, and you get a bit insular.”The six-day Paris event might be menswear’s largest, and busiest – only here is the schedule expanding not contracting – but that does not mean it’s free from drama. With gilets jaunes anti-government protests predicted to take place on Saturday 19 January, Dior was one of the shows to change times, moving its show back one night.Jones seemed nonplussed – “we’re quite organised, so it’s not been too bad to change – a few guests missing perhaps” – but the reality was, one imagines, slightly more fraught.The collection showed 39-year-old Jones’s ability to rework couture for a modern crowd. The suits came inlaid with satin, creating a sort of inside out effect, in colours of mink, light blue and black.There was season-appropriate cashmere, and some hip oversized knitwear designed in collaboration with punk artist Raymond Pettibon, made “using a technique which resembles Moire” which everyone had to Google.Still, the saddle bags were reworked from women’s, while the “hardcore leather opera gloves” had a certain gender fluidity.From afar, it all looked simple enough, but up close techniques including flou and moulage (a method of draping) revealed Jones to be as ever, a stickler for detail. He enjoys these flourishes, of “carrying the concept of Dior as a gallerist as well as a couturier”, although one hand-beaded shirt which required 16 people working for 1,600 hours, was as much work as art.Despite being “pretty tired” the day before, he still had one eye on friend David Beckham, who popped in the day before to say hello, and the other on the commercial.“The red carpet is not usually something I think of a lot but we are dressing a lot of people,” he said. At the Golden Globes, Dior was worn by nominees Viggo Mortensen and Darren Criss. No surprise that Dior is still the world’s biggest luxury brand. The suit expected to appear on the next round of red carpets is a classic shape with a long satin wrap. “Black tie can be a limited thing, but you don’t want it too peacocky.”Plus the stars love him. Just before Beckham turned up, Christina Ricci entered holding a tiny dog, and proceeded to take photos in the mirror. Behind her, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell exited minutes apart. All sat front row."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3abe3cd0c5280563d8e47c7b6b32cc740226f8e/193_228_876_526/master/876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14bbb71b7727c013f660384900e3f2e8","title":"salvador dali in search of immortality review david pujol","story":"David Pujol’s documentary includes some bizarre moments, including Dalí’s seduction of his wife-to-be with a paste made of goat excrement and fish glueProduced by the Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation, this documentary about the relentlessly eccentric Spanish painter benefits – as you would hope it would – from plentiful archive access and a scholarly level of appreciation. So on the one hand we get some utterly bizarre footage of Dalí explaining how he seduced his wife-to-be Gala with a paste made of goat excrement and fish glue (Gala nodding quizzically alongside) and on the other a tight little knot of Dalí connoisseurs discussing the artist with each other while studiously avoiding the camera. The latter certainly elevates the film, but also hampers it it’s pretty dry stuff compared with the slick Exhibition on Screen films we have become used to in cinemas. Some awkward translations and some rough sound edits are also a little off-putting.But, in aiming to go above and beyond the standard-issue profile, this film (directed by David Pujol) gets into some interesting areas. It focuses mostly on the buildings in Dalí’s life: the fisherman’s hut in the Catalan town of Port Lligat where he built his first studio, the villa he eventually transformed it into, the imposing castle in nearby Púbol he bought for Gala, and the gallery in Figueres where he spent his final months and where he is buried. We get some sense of the mechanics of Dalí’s methods, such as the indoor winch he used for his large-scale paintings while his decorative plans – through which he strove, as the title indicates, for a lasting impression – are still remarkable, comparable in effect to Gabriele d’Annuzio’s jawdropping villa at Garda in Italy. Dalí’s relationship with, and enduring respect for, Gala also comes up in sharp relief: a vital collaborator and inspiration, willing and able to give him the runaround."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb5de3e919fafdcd390a54629c0bfa0ea133cd2b/0_2_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8013cae86eae5c91f75320fc24d9fc11","title":"barley water recipe waste not leftovers tom hunt","story":"Instead of discarding your vegetable or grain cooking water, add sweetener and lemons, and serve with a sprig of mint and plenty of iceCooking doesn’t have to be complicated, a skill disappearing with our great-grandmothers or a knowledge harboured only by chefs of great talent.

The date was 6 June 2013 and the club’s then chief executive told a group of journalists that Arsenal’s austerity era – necessitated by the move to Emirates Stadium in 2006 – was over.The long-term commercial deals that Arsenal had felt compelled to lock into so they could secure money up front for the stadium were expiring and the result, according to Gazidis, was an “escalation” in the club’s “financial firepower”. Anything was possible on the transfer market, he suggested, including the signing of A-list players. “We are moving into a new phase where, if we make our decisions well, we can compete with any club in the world,” Gazidis said.At the end of that summer, Arsenal would sign Mesut Özil and there have since been a smattering of other statement purchases – namely Alexis Sánchez, Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. But as the club prepare for Saturday’s pivotal Premier League game at home to Chelsea, the mood is edgy and not only because defeat could leave them nine points adrift of the Champions League places by the end of the weekend.This month Arsenal cannot compete with any club for any permanent signing because, quite simply, the money is not there. It will be a loan or two, at best – perhaps, with a built-in option to buy in the summer, when the new sponsorship arrangements with Emirates and Adidas kick in – and there is bewilderment, to say the least, among some fans.The club’s most recently published accounts, for the six months ended November 2017, showed a profit before tax of £25.1m and cash reserves of £160.7m – including debt service reserves of £23m, which are not available for football purposes. This time last year Arsenal were listed at No 6 on Deloitte’s world football money league. What is going on?The sense of unease has been swelled by the looming loss of Aaron Ramsey to Juventus as a free agent at the end of the season for reasons that are impossible to disconnect from finance. Then, there is Sven Mislintat, the head of recruitment, who arrived from Borussia Dortmund in November 2017. He has grown so frustrated that he has decided to quit he is expected to leave after the closure of the January window.Mislintat was one of the three decision-makers who appointed Unai Emery as the managerial successor to Arsène Wenger last May. Gazidis was another but he walked out last October to join Milan, which means that Raúl Sanllehí, the director of football, is set to be the last man standing. The impression is one of behind-the-scenes turmoil.Arsenal’s financial freeze can be explained by a number of factors. According to the club, the cash reserves in the bank are not merely savings, they are to help with the annual running costs. Large sums of money routinely move in and out of the accounts – such as the instalments on transfer fees or commercial deals – and they might do so after the cut-off for a specific financial period.The analogy is to a family’s monthly budget. In some months, it is necessary to dip into the overdraft. It is not as simple as looking at Arsenal’s year-to-year numbers. As for the half-yearly profits, they were heavily influenced by player sales in the summer of 2017 and that of a development site near the Emirates Stadium on Holloway Road.A more convincing point takes in the fundamental reality under Stan Kroenke, who has been the majority shareholder since April 2011 – the club are wedded to a self-financing business model. What comes out must first have been generated from within.The statistics show that since the summer of 2011, Arsenal have a net spend on permanent transfer fees of £239.9m, which works out at £30m per season. Since the summer of 2013, when Gazidis talked the talk and the shackles came off, it has been £265.8m or £44.3m per season. In other words, not enough to buy a Kyle Walker and significantly short of a Virgil van Dijk.A club’s net spend is not the perfect barometer of its financial health player wages are also a massive part of it and Arsenal’s investment in this area has soared from year to year. But it is nevertheless a decent one. There have been seasons under Kroenke in which Arsenal have pushed the boat out by this measure, namely 2014-15, 2016-17 and the current one. They have invariably been followed by a levelling-off.This season illustrates the point in microcosm. Last summer the club spent £71.4m on five players, including Bernd Leno, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Lucas Torreira, and recouped only £7.6m in sales. It added up to a net spend that was significantly above the mean but it meant the cupboard was always going to be bare come January. Emery knew it would be the case. When he accepted the job, he knew what he was signing up for.Arsenal’s headache is that they have a squad on Champions League wages in year two of a Europa League cycle. The push last summer was an attempt to catapult them back to the elite level and it has increased the jeopardy. The Champions League resembles an express train and when teams fall off it they have to work even harder to reboard – and that can equate to spending.When Manchester United slipped out of the Champions League for 2016-17, they spent over the odds to persuade Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Eric Bailly and Henrikh Mkhitaryan to join up for a Europa League campaign with the promise of clawing back to the top level. In the end, they won the Europa League to regain their Champions League status. Each year a club is out of the competition, it becomes harder to get back in. Liverpool could attest to that.Arsenal’s self-sustaining model has been squeezed by Europa League revenues and the circle can, in time, become vicious. “The reduction in distributions from Uefa for Arsenal last season when they reached the Europa League semi-final, which reflect broadcast revenues, was €26.8m – compared to the amount they received from being in the Champions League the season before,” said Tim Bridge, a director in Deloitte’s sports business group. “But any club in the Europa League will also likely see an impact on match-day and commercial revenues compared with those in the Champions League.”Have Arsenal made their decisions well, as Gazidis hoped they would? The one to give Özil a new £350,000-a-week contract last February to run until 2021 (total value: £62.2m) was based on how it might cost them more to sign a replacement and the nightmare prospect of him leaving on a Bosman, so soon after Sánchez had forced his way to United.One of the consequences has been the withdrawal of the contract offer to Ramsey but Emery has come to doubt Özil’s worth. The manager has integrated the summer signings and those on Mislintat’s watch – chief among them Aubameyang – have generally been positive. But further surgery is required and while money is not everything – witness the work of Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham – it is certainly something.Emery has brought stirring home performances, tactical variety and genuine excitement, at times. The scale of his challenge, and how delicately it is poised, remains clear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/197cfde5c58ea4cd208eeec81e05adeffdb92b99/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bdcac47cc7c3c5cb8d20a30e65a07f6","title":"marouane fellaini king dark times manchester united","story":"Carry on then, Marouane. After some suggestions this week that Marouane Fellaini might be on his way out of Old Trafford, Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s Friday press conference went the other way. Instead Solskjær offered what newspapers like to call “a vote of confidence” in the gangling Belgian utility-menace, talking up Fellaini’s continued presence through this, his sixth year as a Manchester United player.It isn’t hard to see why some said his time was up. Under Solskjær Fellaini has played three minutes in the Premier League. His basic footballing presence has seemed at odds with a more mobile, fluid style. Plus there is of course a wider symbolic aspect to all this.Fellaini will never really shake his status as the first big signing of the post-Ferguson years. Through successive managerial eras he has fronted up gamely, but remained the embodiment of something stubborn and stuck, an inherited burden, like a particularly oppressive antique mahogany Victorian sideboard nobody ever has the will or the guts to throw away.How to characterise the Fellaini years? In his book The Last Empire Gore Vidal offers up a wryly crushing list of the official codenames of every 20th century US overseas military operation, a line-up that reads now like a stock list of the top-selling Macedonian erectile dysfunction drugs currently being advertised up in your spam email folder.Operation Shining Hope. Operation Decisive Enhancement. Operation Golden Python. Operation Noble Obelisk, Urgent Fury, Provide Relief, Provide Hope, Continue Hope, and of course – a personal favourite – Operation Frequent Wind. What codename would best capture Fellaini’s own five-and-a-half-year campaign at Old Trafford, you wonder. Operation Shin-Bobble. Operation Crowd-Slice. Operation Panic Hoof. Operation Slow Clanking Midfield Death?And yet, this is of course unfair in many ways. Fellaini is also the easiest of targets. There is no doubt he has been over-blamed, has become disproportionately symbolic of United’s recent difficult years.Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds: in the five years before Fellaini’s arrival United won four Premier Leagues and one Champions League. In five seasons since they haven’t come close to winning either. The failings have been systemic and structural. Other, more talented players have underperformed more spectacularly. But it is Fellaini who will be most marked by this, and most closely associated as a symbol of the dark times.But then, he was signed under a false premise in the first place. For years United had craved a proper midfielder, a player with the craft and the touch to control the spaces and work the angles, to drive the deeper rhythms of a game.In Fellaini they got someone who’d had his most spectacular times for Everton as a kind of improvised target-man, a No 10 of the skies, making use of his one really outstanding attribute, that incredible Velcro-touch chest control, the ability to catch long passes with those invisible chest-fingers and roll the ball down his neck, wearing it like a scarf, all the while clearing the area around him with a head-high, studs-up roundhouse ninja lunge.Fellaini’s strength and awkwardness remain his awkwardly-embraced strengths, that feeling he is always on the verge of kicking over a side-table, falling through a plasterboard wall, wrenching down the curtains. Otherwise he is a strange A-list midfielder: not fast, agile, notably creative or notably defensive not renowned for his passing, dribbling, tackling, vision, finishing or any other of the more standard qualities.At which point it would be hipper, and more in keeping with the traditions of the sideways football column to start a sentence with the words “But still somehow”. To find a way of saying that in fact Fellaini has secretly been better than anyone thought, that he has at least been a fan favourite, an object of more profound and personal inspiration.Except, this isn’t really true, or at least not yet. Fellaini did play every minute of a couple of successful cup finals. He has scored vital goals. But he has also racked up two – yes: two – assists in five and a half years as a Manchester United midfielder. He has been the king of the bad times, played in the loss at home to Sevilla last year and in the four straight defeats to Wolfsburg, Norwich, Bournemouth and Stoke in December 2015.Plus the way managers have used him has seemed to sum up something more insidious. From Moyes to Mourinho Fellaini has been the bad habit you fall back on when there is no other sensible plan, the big red panic button you grope for under the desk, the sodden kebab spread across your chest in the first light of dawn.It is still hard not to associate him with United’s second signing of the post-Fergie age – Juan Mata – his own laughably disconnected tactical opposite. For a while they seemed always to be yoked together on the touchline, Fellaini a stirringly primal figure, United’s giant wicker football-man, Mata scampering around his ankles like the king of the gnomes. Together they made a perfect emblem of the lack of a guiding hand or long-term plan, a general absence of care and close expertise. Got a big bloke? Get a small bloke in next.It has at least been a genuinely fascinating United career, and a rebuttal to the notion that the only interesting stories are success stories. The news that Fellaini may now be staying after all is to be welcomed too, a chance for him to play for the first time in a team not leaning, a little exhaustedly, on his height and power and, who knows, perhaps to finish all this – Operation Desperate Flick-On, Operation Knee In the Chest – on an unexpectedly happy note."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/232058f2df3e8b49fdbcf9063a1c0188c04a4f4f/1217_804_2359_1415/master/2359.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3a1c65be0a7ee526dd915e7a7f6f3c7","title":"experience i talked a man down from a bridge","story":"I was babbling, saying anything to alter his mood, to convince him I cared and his life still matteredIt was the May bank holiday last year, and my husband, David, and I were taking our dog, a cavapoochon called Joey, for his evening walk. We were on our way home, heading towards a bridge, when I heard a commotion ahead.As we approached, dusk was starting to fall and I could see a figure hunched over on the ground, uncomfortably close to the wall. It was a young man, clearly in distress, crying and shouting, his whole body shaking. I froze, suddenly aware of the gravity of the situation. The bridge ran over a high-speed train track and was a well-known suicide spot. A local family had lost their teenager in that exact place a few weeks earlier.David and I exchanged glances. There was no one around. I knew I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if his death was reported the next day and I’d done nothing.I inched towards the slumped figure, Joey instinctively glued to my side. I asked the young man if I could sit down, then lowered myself on to the ground opposite him, while Joey sandwiched himself between us.I tried a few gentle questions: “What’s your name? How old are you? What do you do?” His answers were monosyllabic. “Tommy. 23. Computers.”“Are you OK?” I asked. “No, I’m not!” he shouted back. He muttered something about a betrayal, and not knowing what to do. His emotions were swinging wildly – tears one moment brittle anger the next. I was desperate to make a connection, asking him where he went to college and feigning delight as I told him my son had studied there, too. I even found myself recounting the story of Neil Laybourn, who had talked a man down from Waterloo bridge in London 10 years ago.“They’re great friends now and have even run a marathon together for charity,” I said. “Who knows? That could be us.” I was babbling, saying anything to alter his mood, to convince him I was a person who cared, and his life still mattered. Then I heard the sound of a train in the distance and knew this was it: the moment he could bolt and throw himself on to the tracks.Time slowed down. There was nothing but me and my incessant chatter. I felt his body tense, saw his eyes swivel downwards. I told him my name, Joey’s name, where I lived, how I was a mother of three, how his life was so big and this was just one tiny part of it, going on and on, desperate to distract him.When the train passed, I let out a sigh. By this time, Tommy’s cries were slowing down and he was stroking Joey under his chin. “He’s a sweet little thing, isn’t he?” he said, his mood lightening. Sensing the danger had passed, I suggested he phone his parents. At first he was reluctant, but I pressed, knowing another train could come any time. “Go on,” I said. “They’ll be worried about you.” He made the call and they arrived soon after, shocked and upset. They scooped him up and whisked him away.When I turned to David, waiting on the path, he told me I’d been sitting with Tommy for 25 minutes. “Is that all?” I said. It felt like hours.I didn’t mention what happened to anyone but thought about Tommy every time I walked Joey across the bridge. Then, one Sunday morning, David greeted me with a smile. He had seen a Facebook post in a community group from someone called Tommy who was looking for the woman and dog who had saved his life.David had messaged Tommy and we arranged to meet the following Wednesday evening in a local pub. He asked me to bring Joey. I was nervous, but as soon as we saw each other we hugged for a good minute and a half. Even though we were strangers, we felt a strong connection. He told me he was on medication and on a waiting list for counselling, which irritated me, knowing how much he needed it now.We’ve met since to take Joey for a walk and we speak every week, bonded by that terrible time on the bridge. After coaxing Tommy to safety, I feel responsible for his future. I want to see him thrive, and live a happy and meaningful life. And if he gets the right help, I know that he can.In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

As you get older, you will start to see yourself differentlyI’m 14 years old. Whenever I see pictures of girls in short dresses and tight tops, all I can think about is how I would never be “pretty enough” to dress like that, how I will never be thin enough. My parents are the ones who discourage me. They tell me how they regret having me, because I’m fat and have made their lives miserable. My mother shows me pictures of actresses and tells me that I should look like them. I don’t know what to do. The only thing I can think about is whether I will ever be accepted as this fat, ugly girl. It’s difficult to cope at school with the negativity around me. I look in the mirror at the acne, blemishes, scars. I often cry in my bedroom for hours. Nothing has helped. Everything just makes it worse.I think everything makes it worse because, at the core of your life, the very people who should be making you feel good about yourself are doing the opposite. It is wrong of your parents to say those things: that is not good parenting, and just because your parents are saying it, doesn’t make it the truth. I’m sorry they are like this, but they must be very unhappy with themselves.When people (such as your parents) don’t like who they are inside, they find it easier to project how they feel on to others to try to get rid of that feeling, instead of looking at themselves and thinking: “How can I work on myself?”Adolescence can be hard enough without your parents behaving in this way. But you will not always feel like this, I promise. This is the number one thing I want you to take away from what I’m saying. How you feel will change because, as you get older and leave home, you will choose who to surround yourself with, and they are likely to be people who make you feel good. You will start to see yourself differently and understand that, like all of us, you have bits that are unique to you. And although you might not be “perfect”, in time you will learn to like yourself. I’m not promising you won’t ever meet people who are nasty, but you will get better at coping and understanding that the problem comes from them, not you. Plus, it won’t matter so much, because they won’t be your parents and you won’t be living with them, having your self-esteem constantly eroded. You will have successes that are not about how you look, and you will feel better about yourself.When you go through the teenage years, you are also at your most self-conscious (Google prefrontal cortex + self-conscious + teenagers), so comments like those from your parents are particularly stinging. Sure, some parents aren’t super gushy about their offspring (mine weren’t), but they should not be saying negative things to you. When I was 14, the inside of my desk at school was plastered with pictures of models with impossibly smooth skin and amazing figures that I had cut out of magazines. I didn’t know about Photoshopping back then and I would torture myself with their perfection. But, eight years later, I was working in the fashion industry, surrounded by models, and I saw close up how they had acne and spots and scars and blemishes. Also, actresses and models have a team of makeup artists, hairdressers, stylists and specialist lighting, and even then the final photographs are manipulated. Read lots of books, read stories where you can imagine what the characters look like, where it is not decided for you. Look at people you know and admire in real life, and work out what it is about them you like. Do you have someone more supportive you can talk to in your everyday life?Lastly, remember that you are finding this hard because it is hard. But none of this is your fault. You are at the beginning of your life and everything is ahead of you. Do not let your parents define who you are. Honestly, one day soon, you will go out into the wider world and discover how beautiful you really are. If your parents can’t see that, it is they who are lacking.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

It’s not even hard any more. My interest in alcohol has evaporated, along with my interest in doing things, talking to people and going outside. All I care about is TV and sugar. And the TV is running out.“We’ve seen all these,” my wife says, scrolling.“Go to catch-up,” I say. “We must have missed something.”“I might have to send you out for some chocolate,” my wife says.“Oh, I bought chocolate,” I say. “This morning.”“What kind?” she says.“All the kinds,” I say. “What’s on real telly?”“Nothing,” she says.“Try switching to the other box,” I say. My wife screams the name of the youngest one. A faint voice from upstairs shouts in reply.“Come down here now!” my wife shrieks.“I almost spent seven quid on a tub of ice-cream today,” I say.“You didn’t,” my wife says.“It wasn’t even a big tub,” I say. “But it was calling to me.” The youngest one appears.“What?” he says.“Switch us over to the other box,” she says, holding out three remotes. The youngest one sighs heavily, kneels in front of the TV and pulls a wire out of the back.“Would this be a good time for a tutorial on how to do this yourself?” he says.“We don’t want to learn,” I say. “We’re done learning.”The next morning I am sent out to buy food for lunch, because the oldest has been invited over. I also buy five doughnuts, which I tell myself are for everyone, but I eat them all before anyone else is awake. The youngest one appears at midday.“Buongiorno!” the radio says. “Come stai?”“What is this?” the youngest says.“It’s an Italian language podcast I found,” I say. “You just listen.”“Sto bene,” the radio says. “Et tu?”“I know more Italian than this,” the youngest says.“This is episode one,” I say. “I accidentally listened to a bit of episode 40, which was, like, an Italian board meeting. So I’ve gone back to the beginning.”“Benissimo!” the radio says.“I thought you were done learning,” says the youngest.“I haven’t learned anything yet,” I say.“Skip ahead,” he says.“Never!” I say. The oldest one arrives. He points to the tortoise, which is eating a lettuce leaf on the kitchen floor.“Why is he up?” he says.“I don’t know,” I say. “He came out from under the washing machine three days ago.”“Isn’t it too early?” he says.“He must not know it’s still Dry January,” I say.“He seems happy, though,” the youngest says.“A bad omen all the same,” I say.“Buona sera!” the radio says.“Shut up,” says my wife, walking in and turning the radio off.“Thank you!” the youngest says.“Hi,” the oldest says.“Welcome to the house of fun,” says my wife, pouring herself a glass of fizzy water. “Can we eat?”After lunch, with the sun already setting, we sit down in front of the TV for a listless argument about what to watch. Eventually we settle on a black-and-white film neither of us has seen before, which is preceded by a stern warning from the FBI.“I resent being told that piracy is not a victimless crime in reference to a movie that was made in 1949,” I say.“The victims are all dead,” my wife says.“Unless the implication is that I’m the victim,” I say.“Hmm,” my wife says.“Like, by committing piracy I’m failing to be my best self.”“Shh,” my wife says. The credits finish. A large car pulls up in front of the revolving doors of a fancy hotel. The dog climbs into my lap and breathes heavily in my face. As a way of spending time, I think, this is just preferable to sitting under the washing machine until spring finally arrives.“So you didn’t buy ice-cream?” my wife says.“Oh, I bought ice-cream,” I say."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89b989f63333e5b31cd0cbd473873dc8eb472fbe/0_29_2440_1464/master/2440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e22287431482c14554d172362eb2ae4","title":"podcast future of education","story":"How can education be improved?

If so, let us know by sharing your thoughts with our panel of education experts to examine what can be done to improve education, and make systems more equal. Whether you’re a teacher, student, academic, social worker, policymaker, parent, and wherever you are in the world, we want to hear from you.This is what Alex Beard, author of Natural Born Learners, and one of our panellists for this podcast, has to say:“Most schools today are not teaching kids how to learn. We lack a common understanding of what education is and what purpose it serves. We set national targets and arrange institutions and organise people so that they can deliver on those targets. This managerial thinking has been around for 100 years. But by standardising things in this way across classrooms, you undermine the efforts of educators.”In an increasingly interdependent world, it’s vital that we strive to understand not just what it is that makes other societies tick, but how others – be they British, Japanese, German or Argentinian – endeavour to solve the same problems that we all share. In this month’s podcast, we will be focusing on the issue of education, and how we as a global community can improve standards of education for children of all nationalities, genders, ethnicities and economic backgrounds.What are the techniques and methods we can all use to reform education models? How far are they needed, and how far can they stretch? Wendy Kopp explains the extent of the issue in her article ‘It’ll take a village to reform global education’:“More than 60 percent of primary school children in low- and middle- income countries do not reach a minimum proficiency in reading and math. We’re even further from ensuring the world’s children gain the competencies and dispositions necessary to shape a better future for themselves and all of us.”One thing is clear: the learning crisis is severe. But the conversation on education still needs to shift towards an understanding that this is a crisis that needs fixing – we know where we want to get to, but we don’t yet know how to get there. Of course, what works in one country might not work entirely in another, but recognising that there are other ways to do things might be a good place to start.What are the common issues we all face? What approaches have you seen implemented, or helped to implement, and what beneficial changes have been brought about in the systems you work in?Now we’d like to hear from you.

The Wellcome Trust is considering moving all of its 800 head office staff to a four-day week in a bid to boost productivity and improve work-life balance.A trial of the new working week at the £26bn London-based science research foundation could start as soon as this autumn, giving workers Fridays off to do whatever they want with no reduction in pay. Some parts of the organisation already operate a no-emails policy in the evenings or at weekends, but this would mark a more dramatic change.It is believed the Wellcome Trust would become the biggest organisation anywhere in the world to try a four-day week. The idea comes amid arguments from trade unions that the fruits of advances in computer technology and artificial intelligence, which improve productivity, should be shared among workers by changing to a shorter working week.Wellcome’s idea means that by the time everyone else’s weekend has started, its employees could have spent a day volunteering, studying another skill or spending time with loved ones.The Trades Unions Congress (TUC) last year called for a wholesale reduction of working hours in the UK, citing research that found almost half of workers want a four-day week. It said UK workers put in the longest hours in the EU, behind only Austria and Greece. In 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted a 15-hour working week for his generation’s grandchildren but the TUC found more than 1.4 million people were working seven days a week.The presenter Kirsty Wark has also called for the switch, saying the extra day off should be used to develop “another skill, do yoga, get fit, or look after a relative”. She said: “I think it takes a radical shift to change our living for the weekend culture.”Wellcome, which is the world’s second-biggest research donor after the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, has been looking closely at last year’s decision by the New Zealand insurance company Perpetual  to switch to a four-day working week.“It looks like moving the working week to four days rather than five gets you a broader productivity and wellbeing benefit,” said Ed Whiting, Wellcome’s director of policy. “You have a healthier workforce, a reduction in sickness absence and improved sense of work-life balance.”He said analysis of the impact of Perpetual ’s switch in March and April, which involved 240 staff, showed small increases in total output, despite staff working shorter hours.Workers felt less “psychologically rushed” and had more time to get things done at home, which in turn boosted their motivation at work.Wellcome said it was still gathering evidence and would make a final decision in the coming months. An autumn trial could involve all or just part of the head office workforce in London.“If you have a shorter working week you have to think how can you use your time really effectively,” said Whiting, who used to work as an adviser to David Cameron in Downing Street. “It’s the concept of seeing time as the most finite thing.”“You have less slacker time in your day,” he added. As a result, people tend to better prioritise their work.However, the Auckland study also found increased stress among some people at having to complete tasks in a shorter timeframe. Some managers reported some workers took the extra day off “as a gift” and did not become more efficient.Surveys have suggested office workers have the capacity to spend hours procrastinating every day. One found only one-fifth of people felt they were consistently productive, with the top distractions cited as checking social media, reading news websites and chatting with colleagues about non-work matters.Wellcome has not entirely settled on the idea of the four-day week and said it was also considering other options for boosting productivity and improving work-life balance, including more flexible working hours. It said it wanted to hear from more organisations that have tried the switch to a four-day week and those that have considered the move but decided against it.Potential risks it has identified include a loss of flexibility if people are required to work only Monday to Thursday. There is also the risk of a public-facing organisation, which handles £1bn a year in science funding, being perceived to make the move as a luxury rather than to increase productivity and wellbeing.The core of the organisation’s work is processing and assessing grant applications for scientific research across biology, medicine, population health, the humanities and social science. That is the kind of predictable process that might be well suited to a shorter week, it believes. It is still working out whether skeleton staffs or rotas are needed to maintain cover in other areas of the organisation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcb312beb17ba4787c457c5a4d64c3de74f85904/375_53_3138_1882/master/3138.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0f9ce08d0699efb4ee39c4efdcd458b","title":"rihanna set to become lvmhs first black female designer reports","story":"New fashion brand, expected to take Fenty name, will be major boost for ersity in industryRihanna is reportedly about to make history as the first black female to head up a fashion brand at the world’s largest luxury conglomerate, LVMH.It would be the first new fashion house the group, which owns Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Givenchy, has launched since Christian Lacroix in 1987.The new brand is expected to take the singer’s last name, Fenty, which she uses for her make-up and lingerie businesses. Speculation was fuelled this week when she stepped out in an oversized pair of sunglasses with the brand’s logo visible on the side.Rihanna has filed a lawsuit against her father, Ronald Fenty, in a dispute over the use of the Fenty name by their respective companies. The lawsuit stated he “egregiously and fraudulently misrepresented to third parties and the public that their company … is affiliated with Rihanna”. Rihanna is asking for a legal injunction on the use of the Fenty name, as well as unspecified damages.The deal would be a shrewd business move for LVMH, which has been courting the singer for some time. While she worked on a capsule collection of sunglasses in 2015 for LVMH’s Dior, she collaborated with Puma in 2016, generating $1bn in sales for the sportswear brand.In 2017, LVMH lured her back to collaborate on her make-up line, Fenty Beauty. The range, which was praised for encompassing a wide range of skin tones, reportedly made $100m in sales within 40 days and was named as one of Time Magazine’s 25 best inventions that year.Her lingerie line, Savage x Fenty, which launched in May 2017, has enjoyed huge success and acclaim for its inclusivity. Pitched as the antidote to existing underwear brands such as Victoria’s Secret, which has been accused of being culturally out of touch and objectifying women, the TechStyle Fashion Group-backed brand includes sizes ranging from from XS to 3XL and features plus-size models in its campaigns.“I accept all of the bodies,” Rihanna told US Vogue last year. “I’m not built like a Victoria’s Secret girl, and I still feel very beautiful and confident in my lingerie.” TechStyle’s CEO told the trade publication WWD at the time that he chose Rihanna because she was “the right partner to bring instant credibility and exposure” to the brand.While the details of her new fashion brand remain under wraps, its concept is a reflection of the state of play in the fashion industry. Established and heritage brands are increasingly teaming up with high-profile celebrities such as Rihanna – who has 67 million Instagram followers – to work on collaborations and endorse products thanks to the influence they hold over the lucrative “Generation Z” consumer market.The Kardashian family are another prolific example of this and have been tapped by several fashion houses, including Calvin Klein, all eager to attract their combined 508.7 million social media followers.Abloh’s mentor Kanye West is another example of a successful musician-to-designer transition. Aside from his claims that his clothing brand Yeezy “will become the biggest apparel company in human history”, it was reported last year that his brand had received a $1.5bn valuation.The launch of Rihanna’s brand could go some way to answering calls for more ersity among fashion’s leaders. Last year, she became the first black woman to be on the September cover, traditionally the largest and most important edition of the magazine, of British Vogue.“A fearless music-industry icon and businesswoman, when it comes to that potent mix of fashion and celebrity, nobody does it quite like her,” said the editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful, of Rihanna."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ecd5387895d5c379a2b0037128832d6bdd6fcf9/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6daf115c8fab76cbfbb224493f6b9e36","title":"how brexit unravelled today in focus podcast","story":"In a disastrous week for Theresa May’s Brexit agreement, her former director of strategy, Chris Wilkins, and the ’s Daniel Boffey chart where it all went wrong.

Readers have been debating Brexit the morning after the prime minister survived a confidence vote I think the prime minister just wants to do this “reaching out” as a PR exercise at the end of which she can announce “I tried, but no one else came up with another answer that respects the referendum... So you have accept my deal.”Her notorious rigidity is a major part of the problem. She fundamentally lacks the qualities to move this forward. Although she cannot be removed, she has to be circumvented to allow other options to be explored. SnagaThe purpose of May’s little speech last night was to play to the gallery of Daily Mail readers and to set the scene for blaming Brexit on the Labour Party. At a time when she needed to speak to the nation she was as isive as ever. GiantrobotThis is possibly the most abject failure of the British political system since the civil war. It’s the very definition of a constitutional crisis. The fact that Parliament can claim to have confidence in the government says that Parliament itself is broken. The citizens of the UK need a means of dissolving Parliament. helicanIt appears that May wants to have talks but doesn’t want to concede anything. Of course a second referendum should be on the table. The talks may conclude that it shouldn’t happen, but surely that is the whole point of talks.On Jeremy Corbyn’s refusal to meet unless she ruled out no deal, she said, “the door is always open.” Well, there’s no point having an open door if she doesn’t have an open mind. BellaTheCookCorbyn and the shadow cabinet absolutely right to insist the dangerous, flailing and failing May takes no deal off the table before they engage in any talks. May is totally responsible for this disaster and in the power of the DUP whose agenda cares nothing for the well being of the whole nation.The contempt with which May and the likes of Michael Gove talk of Corbyn is disgusting considering the harm created by Tories to our declining economy. They have made us the laughing stock of Europe. SissyJupe20May has no idea how to compromise and isn’t about to start now unless her hand is forced. The opposition parties should now unite behind Corbyn’s refusal to have a dialogue until no deal is taken off the table. At the very least they could extract from her a binding vote on it in the Commons.Ultimately though, we saw yesterday that the DUP can call time on her leadership whenever they want, so I assume they’ll be telling her what to do from now on. smazakIt’s time for Theresa May to abandon her red lines. Otherwise she’s merely trying to share blame. Without some gesture from her to indicate a willingness to actually change something, “nothing has changed”. PaulB1I don’t agree with Corbyn’s stance on Brexit but his insistence on Maybot taking “no deal” off the table is absolutely right. Impossible to talk while this vile dictatorial PM arrogantly refuses to listen to anyone except her rapidly shrinking team of sycophants. darquangeI am absolutely furious, that a bunch of self important, over privileged MPs are trying to strip young people of the same opportunities that I had. Its what you expect from the Tories who have always been the party of grumpy old men and busybodies who want to control everyone else. But what with Labour? SporadicWitIt’s beyond disingenuous to claim that Labour don’t have a plan. During the transition period, Labour want to remain in the customs union and the single market, abiding by the rules of both. Longer terms they seek to negotiate a new UK-EU customs union to avoid tariffs and prevent a hard border in Ireland. That seems like a sensible approach – maintain the status quo, but leave, allowing us time to transition slowly. We would be able to leave the customs union at any time, once we’ve begun the separation process. SharkcustardWell over 500 MPs want a no deal taken off the table. For the first time in this Brexit mess May should show good faith and stop the bullying. If she doesn’t then the short to medium problems will affect those with a bit of money dissatisfied with the increased hassle and cost of travel – and all of the other problems that come with a no deal. Those with no money will be worse off in the longer term. So many of her natural supporters will be immediately affected and they will punish her if her brinkmanship doesn’t work, as it’s only in her power to take a no deal off the table. jonniestewpot"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a263f6dae794b9bd97df7cd41665fbd46809dc41/0_40_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30d2e1a7549bcf02e5dd0d363be94a9c","title":"arent you going insane readers questions from beyond brexitland","story":"Jon Henley answers Brexit queries from confused readers around the worldHaving asked those of you living outside the UK if you were confused by the latest news from Brexitland, I got so many responses (thank you all) that I have grouped and paraphrased the most common ones so as to be able answer, at least approximately, as many as possible.And I’ve mostly stuck to factual questions on the Brexit process. “Will Brexit finally teach Britain it no longer rules the world?” from (among others) Steve Norman in Canada, Ferdy in Dublin and Thijs in the Netherlands, warrants a book-length response, but not now.Also, I’m not going into great detail explaining Brexit terminology: if you want answers to that I recommend the ’s handy Brexit phrasebook which hopefully has most of it covered.What are the ground rules of Brexit? I’m seriously confused (Danni, US)Brexit is the process of the UK leaving the EU, which it narrowly voted in favour of in a referendum in June 2016. The process is governed by article 50 of the EU’s Treaty of Lisbon and is happening in two stages: first, the two sides negotiate their orce deal (the “withdrawal agreement”), and after this they will sort out their future trading relationship. It’s proving problematic because the UK voted for a departure but not a destination: some think Britain should remain in a close relationship with the EU, with privileged access to its vast single market but having to obey its rules others think its should strike out on its own, with greater control but less smooth trade. It’s complicated by the red lines set down by the prime minister, Theresa May, (ending the automatic right of EU citizens to settle in the UK, and leaving the EU’s single market and customs union) which exclude a lot of potential options.Can you explain the Irish backstop? (Diane Dalton, US, with related questions from Ton Pasman and Leonie, Netherlands Shona, Ireland Dietmar Homberg, Germany Elisabeth Sanfuchs, Belgium Ayaz Ramji, Canada)When the UK leaves the EU, the border between Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland, which is currently invisible, will become the EU’s only land border with the UK. Such a border normally requires customs and other controls. Nobody wants that, partly because nobody wants a return to the violence of the period before the Good Friday agreement, which removed border checks. In theory, the post-Brexit trading arrangements between the EU and the UK will avoid a “hard” border, but they could take years to negotiate so the EU has insisted on a “backstop” guaranteeing the absence of a hard border until those arrangements are in place. The backstop leaves the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU “unless and until” the EU agrees it can leave. Brexiters do not like this at all.Why is the deadline 29 March 2019 and what’s the problem with extending it? (Dawn, Canada Jean Vigoureux, France)Article 50 provides for two years of talks the UK triggered it on 29 March 2017 so in principle it leaves automatically two years later. It can ask the EU27 for an extension, which they have said they would grant for a valid reason, such as sorting out the final details of a deal that has the support of a majority in the UK parliament. This now looks quite likely, but it may only last for a few months because a new European parliament is sworn in in July and EU rules require all member states to be represented – a problem if the UK is still a member. Experts think this could be resolved with a temporary fix, but the EU would rather avoid the hassle.Can article 50 be revoked and how would the EU respond? (Benjamin Willumsen, Chile)The European court of justice has ruled that the UK can revoke article 50 unilaterally at any time without the permission of the EU27 (who would be delighted, if annoyed by all the UK has put them through). There’s disagreement in the UK about whether it could be done by a simple vote by MPs or would need an act of parliament, but in any case it looks like the last thing the government would do.Is there any chance of another referendum? (Michael Kerr, California Johannes Meigen, Germany David French, New Zealand Laurent, France)There isn’t a majority in parliament for a “people’s vote”, or second referendum, which both the Tory and Labour leaderships argue would undermine people’s faith in democracy. That could change, but one of the problems is the time it could take to organise another vote: the government says it would take a year, which is an exaggeration, but it would almost certainly take longer than the UK has left, and possibly longer than the relatively short extension likely to be favoured by the EU.What is Labour’s position and why? Why does Jeremy Corbyn think he can negotiate a different or better deal with the EU than Theresa May? (Fernando Hervas, Belgium Antje, Switzerland)Labour’s position is complicated by the fact that under the UK’s first-past-the-post electoral system, many of its MPs represent constituencies that voted to leave while most of its members and voters are pro-remain. Corbyn himself is also far from being a convinced pro-European. The party has sat on the fence until now – favouring a general election before all other options – but will soon have to come off it. If the EU agrees to rewrite parts of the withdrawal agreement, Labour could get a better deal than May if it dropped (some of) her red lines, but it has been as guilty as the Conservatives of pretending that Britain can leave the EU while retaining all the advantages of membership.Have any trade deals been approved with non-EU nations? What are World Trade Organization terms, and why are they a bad thing? (Patrick Speer, Scotland and Liam, Australia)Britain is not formally allowed to negotiate new trade deals while still an EU member. It has signed off on a text said to replicate current trading arrangements with Switzerland. Other than that, hardly any of the 68 trade deals from which the UK benefits as an EU member, and which it said it would have replicated by the time of departure, are near, and none will be ready by 29 March, according to the FT. Brexiters talk about “trading on WTO terms” as if it is what the world does, but it does not: it may trade under WTO rules, but all 164 members of the WTO have also agreed bilateral or regional trade deals that allow them to trade on much better terms than the WTO baselines. No sensible nation would leave the world’s largest single market, the EU, to trade with it on WTO terms, as would happen in the event of no deal.What might happen in the the first weeks and months after a no-deal Brexit? I’m travelling to Britain in April – will my trip be disrupted, might there be food shortages? (Mark Singer and Gerry Patey, Canada Francois Bry, Munich Jean Ballanco, US)As far as food shortages go, it’s anyone’s guess. Major British supermarket chains have started stockpiling tinned goods and MPs have said Britons may need to adopt a different diet, which does not sound promising, but it’s hard to imagine it coming to that. No deal would certainly be likely to cause disruption at airports the European commission last month unveiled a temporary nine-month plan to keep planes in the air and goods and money flowing should the UK crash out, and Britain has the army standing by, but an awful lot of things we take for granted could change very suddenly if Britain leaves without a deal. British visitors to Europe will need to apply for an online visa waiver, similar to the the US Esta programme, once it comes into operation in 2020 if the UK crashes out before then, they may – depending on how the UK decides to treat EU visitors – require a Schengen area visa.Does the Queen have any powers to intervene? (Vincent, Netherlands Isabel Pitta, Brazil)The monarch is not meant to get involved in politics. But she is the only person who can invite someone to form a government, and if Theresa May loses another no-confidence vote, she might have to. She would have 14 days to ask someone to form a new administration (including a cross-party option) providing it was clear they could command a majority in parliament. If no majority exists, new elections would automatically follow. The Queen, however, cannot dissolve parliament, having lost this power in the 2011 Fixed-term Parliament Act.Will my daughter, who is French, need to apply for a visa to study in the UK? Will we need international driver’s licences? (K Joubert, France Michael Lea, Spain)European students currently studying in the UK or applying to start courses in 2019 will not face any additional restrictions because of Brexit, the government has said. It has warned, however, that UK drivers living in the EU should exchange their licence for a local one – and if possible get an international driving permit – as soon as possible in case of a no-deal Brexit, which might invalidate their UK licence, or mean they have to take a new driving test.How do you get out of this mess? When will all the turmoil be over – aren’t you going insane?

Some even say they would split the Tory party over the issue.There is no majority in parliament for a no-deal Brexit, but under the EU Withdrawal Act 2018 the UK will leave the EU on 29 March whether a deal is in place or not.In order to avoid the significant economic and legal disruption that would result from leaving without a deal, the government must either win the support of parliament for a withdrawal agreement or delay or revoke article 50, the formal process of leaving.After Tuesday’s defeat, May said she would talk to “senior parliamentarians” to try to find a deal that MPs could back. But with the prime minister reluctant to budge on any of her “red lines”, it is far from clear how she can achieve this.A British request for more time is seen as almost inevitable by Brussels, not just because MPs are locked in stalemate, but because it looks impossible for parliament to pass all the necessary pre-Brexit legislation before 29 March. “If the UK comes around and asks for an extension of article 50 for a good reason, I don’t really see any one of the EU27 objecting,” one EU diplomat said.For the EU, “a good reason” is not another six months of chaos and confusion at Westminster – but a second referendum would not be the only condition for an extension there may be other good reasons.If article 50 was extended beyond the summer the UK might be obliged to take part in European elections in late May. In which case, Farage, the former Ukip leader and key pro-Brexit campaigner, has said he would run. However some EU officials think Brussels can come up with legal fixes, such as allowing the UK government to appoint national parliamentarians to represent the UK during the extension period. Yes, but there is currently no majority in parliament for that option. MPs would have to legislate for a second referendum, which would mean extending article 50 for several months. And without a deal on the table that parliament can agree on, it is unclear what the “Brexit” option on the ballot paper would really mean.The prime minister is so decisively boxed in that only dramatic moves remain open to her. One of those is to call a general election.May believes strongly that her deal is closer to what the public wanted when they voted in the referendum, than a softer, Norway-style deal which would allow continued freedom of movement, and which she derides as a “politicians’ Brexit”.She could choose to trigger a referendum herself, again to appeal directly to the public, over the heads of her squabbling MPs. Or she could resign. With much of Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU yet to be negotiated, May could pledge to step down in exchange for supporting her deal, and let a leaver take over for the next stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae4d3568b88c45966ffa531729bdf331f571ba56/204_167_4592_2755/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=baa5244fadca49343506eb1b36d785ce","title":"diane abbott accuses bbc question time of legitimising racism","story":"Labour MP’s spokesperson claims she was mocked and interrupted more than other panellistsDiane Abbott has accused BBC Question Time of legitimising racist abuse after claims that the shadow home secretary was singled out before and during Thursday night’s episode of the political discussion programme.The Labour politician claimed she had been unfairly mocked in the warm-up and had been interrupted more often than other panellists by Fiona Bruce, the programme’s new chair.“We are appalled by the treatment of Diane Abbott on BBC’s Question Time,” a spokesperson for Abbott said. “It was clear that a hostile atmosphere was whipped up, propped up by reports of inappropriate and sexist commentary in the audience warm-up session.“A public broadcaster like the BBC should be expected to be a model of impartiality and equality. The BBC cannot claim anything of the sort when analysis of the programme shows that the only black woman on the panel was jeered at and interrupted more times than any other panellist, including by the chair herself.“The media must stop legitimising mistreatment, bias and abuse against Ms Abbott as a black woman in public life. The BBC should be ashamed that their programming is complicit in such behaviour.”Audience members who attended the filming of Question Time in Derby claimed that the warm-up for the programme included innuendo about Abbott’s past relationship with Jeremy Corbyn and that the audience booed her name when it was announced.The audience loudly applauded when she was asked about Corbyn’s refusal to engage in Brexit talks with Theresa May unless the prime minister ruled out a no-deal departure from the EU.Abbott’s staff suggested the warm-up had “set the whole audience up to be quite negative” about the politician, while pointing at online viral videos suggesting Bruce had interrupted Abbott more than the other panellists.A BBC spokesperson said the corporation had been in touch with Abbott’s team but suggested some of the claims about the show’s treatment of her which went viral on social media are false. “We are sorry to hear Diane Abbott’s concerns over last night’s edition of Question Time and we have contacted her team today to reassure them that reports circulating on social media are inaccurate and misleading. Diane is a regular and important contributor to the programme … we firmly reject claims that any of the panel was treated unfairly either before or during the recording.”Question Time and other BBC current affairs programmes have become a lightning rod for claims of media bias against Labour, with the corporation repeatedly forced to defend aspects of its presentation of political topics.The Momentum campaign group launched a petition demanding the BBC apologise after Bruce backed claims that Labour was behind in the opinion polls.The Momentum petition referred to an exchange where panellist Isabel Oakeshott said that Labour were “way behind in the polls” and Abbott replied that “we are kind of level-pegging” before Bruce said that Labour were “definitely” behind. But recent polling has found the two parties roughly neck and neck.Abbott has appeared on Question Time at least 29 times over several decades, according to her office. In a 2017 article for the , she described her experience as one of the UK’s first black MPs, highlighting the level of abuse she received on social media.“I went into politics to create space for women and other groups who have historically been treated unfairly,” she wrote. “Once, the pushback was against the actual arguments for equality and social justice. Now the pushback is the politics of personal destruction. This is doubly effective for opponents of social progress. Not only does it tend to marginalise the female ‘offender’, but other women look at how those of us in the public space are treated and think twice about speaking up publicly, let alone getting involved in political activity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a0fb35642adf9e2c05854f1fc3e8b1471185873/0_72_4588_2754/master/4588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25168583429015916f3daab74a9af057","title":"ian paisley jr urged to reimburse charity for first class plane ticket","story":"Fellow MP says Paisley should repay Co-operation Ireland for flight to New York for seminarThe Democratic Unionist Ian Paisley Jr has been urged by a fellow MP to reimburse a charity for the price of a first-class plane ticket to New York.The North Antrim MP travelled to the city in February 2018 to participate in a seminar about Northern Ireland’s peace process on the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement.According to the House of Commons register of interests, he received £6,327 to cover a £5,925 flight and £402 for accommodation from the peace-building charity Co-operation Ireland.The Republic of Ireland’s deputy premier, Simon Coveney, flew economy on the budget airline Norwegian Air to attend the seminar, with his expenses covered by the Irish government.Norwegian Air economy return flights to New York from Dublin this month are advertised for as little as €193 (£170).The SDLP said the former Foyle MP Mark Durkan had also flown economy to New York with the cost covered by Co-operation Ireland.The Sinn Féin MP Michelle Gildernew called on Paisley to reimburse the costs to the charity after being contacted by people who had taken part in Co-operation Ireland fundraising events and said they were “absolutely disgusted and sickened that this expense was covered”.Co-operation Ireland said it did not wish to comment on the figures, which were disclosed by the Irish News, a Belfast-based newspaper.Paisley refused to comment on the matter as he attended an event at Ballymena town hall on Friday. The DUP also declined to comment.Last year the politician was suspended from the Commons for 30 days for “serious misconduct” for failing to declare two family holidays to Sri Lanka, paid for by the country’s government, in 2013.The controversy led to the first recall petition in British parliamentary history being launched in an attempt to unseat Paisley and trigger a byelection in his North Antrim constituency.Paisley said its failure was evidence that people had accepted his apology."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f32a25485fd55e282c6b22d12e28891460b36aba/0_544_4354_2613/master/4354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d99ba623269ae6a292e120fb8be7a5a","title":"antarctica tardigrades crustaceans mercer subglacial lake","story":"Scientists surprised by haul of crustaceans and tardigrades in undisturbed subglacial lakeScientists have found the remains of tiny, ancient animals in an Antarctic lake that has lain undisturbed for thousands of years beneath a kilometre-thick slab of ice.The surprise haul of dead crustaceans and tardigrades, also known as “water bears” or “moss piglets”, was made by US researchers on a rare mission to drill into the Mercer subglacial lake which lies nearly 400 miles from the south pole.David Harwood, a researcher at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a member of the Salsa (Subglacial Antarctic Lakes Scientific Access) expedition, told the journal Nature that finding carcasses of the small animals – they range in size from 0.1mm to 1.5mm – was “fully unexpected”.Scientists made the discovery when they inspected mud scraped off an instrument they had lowered into the lake’s icy waters. As expected, the mud contained remnants of photosynthetic algae that lived and died in the area millions of years ago when Antarctica was much warmer.But the mud also contained the bodies of other, more recent creatures. Researchers found eight-legged tardigrades, the speckled shell of a shrimp-like crustacean with legs dangling from it, and a second shell still bristling with delicate hairs. What at first looked like worms in the mud turned out to be the tendrils of a plant or fungus.Aware that the creatures might have contaminated other equipment, the scientists cleaned their kit and lowered it into the lake once more. When they hoisted it up and analysed the mud a second time, they found more of the same remains.It is not clear how the organisms came to be in the ice-covered lake, but scientists believe that they may have lived in nearby ponds and streams during warm periods when the glaciers retreated either 10,000 or 120,000 years ago.One possibility is that the creatures washed into the lake through rivers under the ice. Alternatively, they may have been carried in after becoming stuck to the underside of an encroaching glacier.Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College and head of the Lake Ellsworth Consortium, a UK project that aims to explore a subglacial lake under the ice of west Antarctica, said it was “a lovely finding”.He said: “It hints that life may exist in more complex forms than thought previously underneath the massive ice sheet in Antarctica.”Siegert said more work was needed to establish whether the organisms had been flushed into the lake from upstream – suggesting there was life under the middle of the Antarctic ice sheet – or from the sea, or by some other route. “Each of these would be intriguing,” he said.Sandra McInnes, an expert in tardigrades at the British Antarctic Survey, said: “If they can get DNA out of these remains, that would be fantastic.”If the tardigrade DNA perfectly matches that of species alive today, then scientists will suspect the animal was carried into the lake on contaminated drill equipment.But the DNA may be far older and indicate an ancient relative of a modern species. Genetic analysis might also confirm whether it was a marine or terrestrial creature, McInnes said.So far, nothing has been pulled alive from the Mercer subglacial lake. With so much ice overhead, too little light may reach the water to sustain organisms such as photosynthetic algae.But Byron Adams, a researcher at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, told Nature that he still hoped to find something that had set up home in the lake. “It’s possible that you could still find things that are alive,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a46bd1e49ac7dd4377bb7a1dafe430d8a1cacecf/0_154_5368_3221/master/5368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93c8553de8cc84f6cfabe2a9d8a38ea4","title":"natural history museum dinosaur dippy lands in glasgow","story":"Specialists put 21.3-metre skeleton back together in Kelvingrove MuseumExperts have been piecing together Dippy the dinosaur before he goes on public display on the only Scottish stop of his UK tour.The Natural History Museum London’s 21.3-metre replica diplodocus skeleton arrived at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow this month after sailing across the Irish Sea.Specialists are now unpacking the 292-bone structure and undertaking the giant jigsaw puzzle of putting the dinosaur back together.Lorraine Cornish, the Natural History Museum’s head of conservation, said: “As Dippy on Tour approaches the halfway point, having proved a huge success at the first three destinations, it seems very fitting that the next stop is a homecoming of sorts.“The Scottish leg of the tour, where the creation of the NHM Dippy cast was first discussed, is the perfect destination to reflect on the many people Dippy has so far inspired to explore their own natural world.“We hope the visitors to Dippy in Glasgow will be equally enthralled by this Jurassic ambassador.”Before arriving in Glasgow, Dippy was on display in Belfast and travelled to Scotland by ferry in 16 bespoke crates.Dippy will be on display at the Kelvingrove from 22 January until 6 May.Before then, visitors can watch him being put together from the balcony around the main hall.Before the tour, the dinosaur had never been on public display outside of London.David McDonald, chair of Glasgow Life, said: “Dippy is here.

Montpellier, coached by former Scotland head coach Vern Cotter, had got themselves back in the contest having been trailing to three penalties from Jaco van der Walt with a try from Jacques Du Plessis on the stroke of half-time.But the penalty that put them ahead in the second half jolted the hosts back into the ascendancy and they went on to seal an historic achievement for Scottish rugby as both clubs reached the knockout stages of Europe’s premier competition for the first time together.Edinburgh made the better start and Van Der Walt kicked two penalties as the pressure forced the visitors into infringements.Montpellier began to settle but their only flash of creativity, when Johan Goosen kicked the ball into the path of winger Henry Immelman, was met by excellent tackles from both Blair Kinghorn and Graham.Edinburgh lost Scotland flanker Hamish Watson to injury but they went further ahead when Van Der Walt dispatched the second of two penalties near the 40-metre line, after Jacques Du Plessis had swung an arm at WP Nel without further punishment.Bismarck Du Plessis also evaded action after pushing an Edinburgh physio as he tried to retrieve the ball in touch, and the visitors made the most of their first penalty of the game in the final seconds of the half.Ruan Pienaar took it quickly inside the 22 and Jacques Du Plessis was adjudged by the TMO to have touched down inches over the line.The French side maintained the momentum and Pienaar kicked them ahead seven minutes after the restart.But Edinburgh soon turned things round as they stepped up the tempo. Van Der Walt’s kick beyond the try-line was snuffed out by Pienaar, Duhan Van Der Merwe burst past three players before being stopped and the pressure eventually told when Montpellier conceded a penalty at a driving maul five metres out. Van Der Walt restored the hosts’ lead.Edinburgh continued to stretch Montpellier and, after several near misses from a series of rucks near the line, Henry Pyrgos fed Graham to cross on the right flank and Van Der Walt added the extra points.On Glasgow’s qualification, Cockerill joked: “There’s always one down side to the evening, isn’t there?“I enjoy the rivalry and the rivalry is going to get stronger and better.“But it’s great for Scottish rugby. We have got two teams in the quarter-finals. There is a lot of good things happening in the Scottish game, so let’s enjoy it.”There was one real down side for Scottish rugby, though, as the flanker Watson emerged as a major doubt for much of the Six Nations.“We think it is a broken bone (in the hand), which is disappointing to say the least,” Cockerill said.In the other Pool Five match Toulon edged an entertaining but meaningless clash at Newcastle 27-24. There were six scintillating tries shared in an exciting, error-strewn match, including two in the opening five minutes and three more in a frantic three-minute spell late in the second half. Newcastle fought back from 20-10 down to lead 24-20, only to immediately concede a heart-breaking winning try to Bastien Soury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c31a040b6480d8f57dd9e00d2fc2d08e0c18574/0_23_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ece16ce5ed6b83208e2587f0a5b6d7a4","title":"katelyn ohashis perfect 10 reminded america life could be fun again gymmastics","story":"The gymnast’s unbridled exuberance and joy set off a floor routine that captivated millions around the world as a message of hope to all in the face of adversityThere’s a reasonably good chance you’ve already seen the video of the American gymnast Katelyn Ohashi’s floor exercise from a quad meet in Anaheim last weekend. The two-minute clip of the UCLA senior tumbling and swaying and launching her 4ft 10in form into the air to a frenetic mashup of 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s hits became a viral smash almost immediately after it was posted to the team’s Twitter feed and has since racked up more than 40m views and counting.Virality is an unpredictable cocktail and the widespread appeal of the 21-year-old’s routine, which earned the sixth perfect score of her collegiate career and helped the Bruins to a first-place finish over California, Michigan State and UC Davis, is not down to any one ingredient. Her technical skill and extraordinary athleticism are obvious – the double layout with a split is a kicker rarely seen on the college level – but hardly unparalleled. Her charisma and showmanship are palpable but not without precedent, nor are the nostalgia-drizzled musical choices of Ike \u0026amp Tina Turner and Earth, Wind \u0026amp Fire along with the Jackson 5 and Michael and Janet Jackson.The secret sauce, it seems, is the unbridled exuberance on display, both in Ohashi’s performance and the delirious reactions of her teammates watching from the sidelines and hanging on every step and manoeuvre, which altogether offers a welcome advert for a sport that’s been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons over the past two years in the United States: gymnastics is fun.The pitchwoman could hardly be more appropriate given Ohashi’s particular journey. The one-time prodigy had been earmarked for Olympic stardom as a 14-year-old junior gymnast after capturing four gold medals, including the all-around title, at the US national championships in 2011. But even as she made an apparently seamless transition to the senior level by winning the all-around at the 2013 American Cup – edging no less than future Olympic hero Simone Biles for top of the podium – the Seattle native found herself breaking down both physically and mentally.She underwent surgery the following month that sidelined her for the rest of the year, followed by another surgery for a fractured back and a warning from doctors that she might never be able to return to competition. Ohashi’s auspicious senior debut wound up being the final meet of her elite career. Her well-documented reflections on her exit while ambivalent are flecked with a sense of relief.Soon after Ohashi accepted a scholarship offer to compete at UCLA under longtime coach Valorie Kondos Field, the former classical dancer who has transformed the Bruins into one of the nation’s most decorated programs. College gymnastics, which operates under different and far more accessible rules than in the Olympics, is a step down from the elite circuit, but engenders a team-oriented environment where Ohashi has rediscovered the joy of enjoying the sport on her own terms and thrived. She shared the inidual national title in the floor exercise at last year’s NCAA women’s gymnastics championships while helping the Bruins to a seventh team crown.Last week’s clip is not the first collegiate floor routine to go viral. It’s not even Ohashi’s first: her floor exercise from last year’s Pac-12 championships was viewed more than 80m times on Facebook alone. But it’s hard to recall an entry from the surprisingly robust YouTube subgenre of collegiate floor exercises that’s made such a mainstream splash, earning shout-outs from Jesse Jackson, Kamala Harris and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Ohashi has made the media rounds in the week since and leveraged the occasion to bring attention to the body shaming that she endured during her elite career.“In the gym, outside of the gym, on the internet, so it’s something that you can never really escape,” Ohashi said Thursday on ABC’s Good Morning America , where she read one of the poems that she wrote to help cope with the pain. “As a 14-year-old, it’s kind of hard to cope with, because you’re still developing as a person, and so everything really impacts you.”At a time when the US and UK are up against their own depressing maelstroms – and the parochial space of gymnastics in the former hasn’t fared much better – leave it to one of our smallest athletes to give the world the big pick-me-up it so desperately needs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/932d1d945c99ebdf38519bf7bf05fd1726e9b0a7/0_235_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=006145af3470e303b93cbd4c9964d610","title":"retirement not on roger federers mind after sweeping into australian open last 16","story":"Roger Federer at 37 shows no signs of sending his fans into mourning by even thinking about retiring from tennis, and said after his 100th match on Rod Laver Arena, “For the time being, it’s all good. Lights are on green.”The six-time and defending champion is chasing a hat-trick at the Australian Open, confirming his form and fitness with a comfortable straight sets win on Friday over the 21-year-old American, Taylor Fritz (who was making his debut on the tournament’s showcase court), to advance to the fourth round of a slam for the 64th time.Fritz, a former US boys champion, is ranked 50 in the world and took two sets off Alexander Zverev at Wimbledon last year, but he floundered against Federer. The Swiss remains on another level and, although stretched by Dan Evans on Wednesday, he looks up for the challenge from any of the young contenders who are increasingly making their presence felt.On Sunday, he will test himself against one of the best of the rising prospects, Stefanos Tsitsipas, who had to fight hard to get past the 19th seed, Nikoloz Basilashvili, in four sets. Tsitsipas – whose 21st birthday in August arrives four days after Federer’s 38th – had earlier joked he would be thrilled to play him next, but hoped it would be Fritz.“If I had known that Roger was 2-0 up when I said that,” he confessed later, “I probably wouldn’t have said it.“I learned a lot since my last match with him. I know the patterns that he’s using a bit better now. He’s serving really well, so I’m going to have to utilise his, and take advantage of my returns as much as possible. I’m pretty sure he’s going to be serving well, so the return games need to be aggressive and pressing a lot.“He’s a legend of our sport. It will be a great day facing him in one of the best arenas, Rod Laver. I’m really excited for that match.”Responding to the suggestion that Federer regarded him as a quiet type, Tsitsipas said: “I do all my talking in the court. Actually, I was shy when I was a kid but not anymore. I think I’m comfortable meeting new people and having a discussion with someone. But not many of the players want to be friends on the tour. That’s a problem, that’s an issue – unless you speak the same language. That’s why you see all these Spaniards, Latin Americans, hang out with each other. Then you have Asian people with each other. So that makes sense.”There will be no contempt when he and Federer become more familiar – almost certainly on Laver again – but plenty of mutual respect.“I’m happy I played against him at the Hopman Cup,” Federer said of a match in which he needed two tie-breaks to win and take Switzerland through to the final. “He played really well there. I actually did too. It was really high-quality tennis. This is obviously a different type of match, it being best of five, and the fourth round of a slam.“I like how he mixes up his game and also comes to the net. So will I. I think we will see some athletic, attacking tennis being played.”The man Federer defeated in last year’s Australian Open final, Marin Cilic, squeezed through in the early hours, coming from two sets down against Spain’s Fernando Verdasco and surviving two match points in the fourth-set tie-break – Verdasco double faulted on the second match point – to win 4-6, 3-6, 6-1, 7-6 (8), 6-3.Rafael Nadal crushed the young Australian hope Alex De Minaur 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. De Minaur went into the contest on a seven-match winning streak after claiming his first ATP title in Sydney last week but the scoreline was exactly the same as in their meeting at Wimbledon last summer.The 19-year-old showed great fight in the third set, saving five match points, yet Nadal converted the sixth to set up a last-16 meeting with Tomas Berdych, the two-time Melbourne semi-finalist who is rediscovering his touch after missing the second half of last season with a back injury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e67239f68d4823804bd8258f149613fa81816db4/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b32f1ef6f307eacf1e456cc88a28e605","title":"liv little its a big thing for a black woman to see yourself reflected back","story":"Women of colour need their own space, which is why Liv Little set up gal-dem. As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we explore how she started a culturequake that’s been felt throughout the media ever since. All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithLiv Little walks into Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour office with a smile that is as big and bright as her red puffer coat, impressive considering how exhausted she is. We’re here to discuss the rise of women and non-binary people of colour in media, an industry in which Little has emerged as a bright new star. It’s the reason we asked her to be part of the  Labs’s and Google Pixel 3’s Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, where innately curious people discuss how they discover the extraordinary all around them. Little collapses into the waiting arms of a slouchy upholstered chair, humbly receiving congrats on the runaway success of her independent digital and print zine, gal-dem, from a producer who has popped in to say hi.In a year that has been “Feminist AF”. In the age of #MeToo, self care, #BlackGirlMagic and #GirlsDoingWhateverTheFuckTheyWant, it’s not surprising that 2018 has also been the year of Little and gal-dem. It’s hard to find a young woman who better sums up the cultural shift. Her publication, with a corrective emphasis on intersectional feminism, is produced by a team of outspoken, socially conscious, whip-smart young women and non-binary people of colour, from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds. It’s a refreshing change from the publishing world’s longstanding homogenous population of largely white, mostly cisgender, predominantly privileged and Oxbridge-educated citizenry.“I wanted to connect with other women and non-binary people of colour. I wanted it to be a free space where people can come and read about experiences like their own,” Little explains of gal-dem’s beginnings. “I realised that it’s a big thing for a black woman to see yourself reflected back.”Add Little to the list of young women interrogating and disrupting historically white, tough-to-break-into professions globally – women such as the newly elected 29-year-old Latinx US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or the black British book publisher Sharmaine Lovegrove.Little and gal-dem reflect the moment as much as they are the moment. And their rise coincides with a new wave of women and non-binary people of colour who felt their voices were not being heard in the everyday, so did something extraordinary to get it out there – notably carving space for themselves in the UK media world including Slay in Your Lane authors Yomi Adegoke and Elizabeth Uviebinené, journalist Afua Hirsch and the influencer and body positivity activist Chidera “The Slumflower” Eggerue.Meanwhile, gal-dem’s growing team of more than 15 editors, writers and assistants have been juggling projects that rival those of legacy publishing giants with exponentially larger staffs – a truly extraordinary achievement. There was the takeover of the  Weekend Magazine in August, during a month when black women ruled the September glossy monthly covers. And then there was the summer launch of gal-dem’s partnership with Liberty London and Dialogue Books to create a literature course, aptly titled Rewriting the Canon and dedicated to iconic authors of colour. Add to that an exhibition they curated in June about the Windrush generation for City Hall and a week-long pop-up with Penguin in November to celebrate the launch of Michelle Obama’s global phenomenon of a book, Becoming. The pop-up featured events that centred on various themes in the former first lady’s memoir – from a discussion about black motherhood to a talk with businesswoman and activist Gina Miller.This hardly scratches the surface of the long list of wins gal-dem has had since Little first launched the project as a student at the University of Bristol back in 2015.Little had an “overwhelmingly positive” childhood, growing up in south-east London with a close relationship to her Buddhist mother and human rights worker aunt (her mum’s identical twin). She didn’t experience the negative and isolating aspects of being a woman of colour navigating white environments until she started university, where she studied politics and sociology. “My childhood was very much about me being comfortable enough to know that my voice is as important as anyone else’s. And then I went to uni and saw a disparity in circumstances that I had never seen before. I was around the super elite for the first time – people who had cards with family bank names on them, people with very conservative beliefs. It was different from what I was used to back home with my mum’s erse roster of friends. I was in a place where I was studying things and suddenly I had this feeling of: ‘Why is there no space for me?’”It was a question women of colour were asking the world over – using everyday, free platforms such as Instagram to create and market the kinds of extraordinary imagery and storytelling they wanted to see, but couldn’t find in mainstream media. And so gal-dem became the UK’s biggest success story in what emerged as a global wave of independent upstarts by women and non-binary people of colour, including Well Read Black Girl – a US-based online book club and content platform-turned Brooklyn literary festival – and Azeema Mag, an annual print zine dedicated to women within the Menasa region (Middle East, north Africa and south Asia).Now, gal-dem is not just a space for Little, but hundreds of contributors around the world, with content that is as erse as its readership. A scroll through the site reveals stories and news that feel very much like the charged WhatsApp threads taking place between women of a certain mindset – outspoken, socially conscious women who identify with prominent outspoken, socially conscious women such as Roxane Gay, Tracee Ellis Ross, Michaela Coel and Yara Shahidi. The articles on gal-dem have titles such as Are you a woke pixie dream girl?, Why Solange is my style icon, and The sex-deprived lives of young women who move back home. The tone strikes a balance that’s difficult to achieve between critical and cheery, knowing and earnest. And it resonates with women of all backgrounds. “I’ve received a lot of emails from white mothers saying that it’s been a really useful resource to help them understand their daughters. And I get a lot of young people asking me what to do to start a magazine,” she says.That leads us to the other extraordinary part of Little’s trajectory that she’s a media success story at a time when the industry is having an identity crisis. “It’s hard because the media is not always the nicest industry to be in and progress through. The environment can be hostile,” Little says, before thinking back to her time navigating jobs at television networks. “I’ve been in situations where I was the only person in the room who looked like me. You can find yourself tokenised.”But for the past year, she’s made gal-dem her full-time job – with the exception of freelance roles as contributing editor of Elle UK and a factual executive producer at the BBC – devoting all of her energy to turning her platform into a viable business. Does it sound like an empire in the making? For Little, it’s all to play for. “It’s now just a case of growing it further,” she says. And with that, a second producer comes in to greet her.

As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we find out why no one embodies that more than influencer Chidera Eggerue. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithAt first glance, the words “woke” and “fashion” don’t exactly seem to have much in common. But some time between the former’s emergence in progressive black circles in the US as a term to describe social, political and racial awareness in the early aughts and its co-opting by the internet mainstream as a slang catchall in the 2010s, it became the fashion in fashion. An extraordinary term that became everyday. In 2016, MTV actually added “woke” to its list of 10 words you should know.The proof is in the wave of catwalk political statements that started with designers such as Maria Grazia Chiuri at Dior and Prabal Gurung reviving the protest slogan tees made famous by Katherine Hamnett in the 1980s. This spirit of activism continues apace with model bookers taking a more considered, erse approach to casting that’s beyond tokenism: from the cornrowed Sudanese model Adut Akech walking the Valentino runway and Kenyan born Halima Aden in hijab at MaxMara, to trans model Jessica Espinosa walking for Louis Vuitton and the reappearance of older supers, such as Stella Tennant at Salvatore Ferragamo.Meanwhile, the influencer corners of Instagram went from aspirational street style, carefully filtered selfies and designer outfits to spaces leaning more towards activism, where a new class of equally well-dressed but notably less filtered women began opening up about their flaws with candour. These everyday women advocated for greater body positivity, equal pay and more meaningful ersity.Scroll through Instagram on any given day and you’ll see original fashion influencers such as Tamu McPherson declaring Black Lives Matter and Susie Bubble encouraging her followers to exercise their right to vote. Or model Adwoa Aboah revealing her struggles with addiction and mental health. Or actress Yara Shahidi demanding tighter gun control. But perhaps no one embodies the sea change from unheralded to everyday heroine more than Chidera Eggerue. Better known as The Slumflower, Eggerue is a Nigerian-born south Londoner who’s used her fashion blog to interrogate and dismantle rigid, age-old standards of beauty.It helps that Eggerue’s rise coincided with a general backlash against the false, Facetuned perfection that had been so pervasive on social media channels such as Instagram – and a shift towards iniduality and authenticity. “I do feel that I am a new breed of fashion influencer because I’m contributing to changing the way people view themselves, and I think how you view yourself influences the types of decisions that you make,” she says.Eggerue chose the name The Slumflower after a project by the same name that was created by menswear collective Street Etiquette about a rose growing from concrete – or, in Eggerue’s case, a young girl growing up in Peckham. “Beautifully growing, glowing and flourishing in an environment that appears to promote the opposite,” she says.Eggerue recalls reading fashion magazines as a child and being struck by the homogenous depiction of glamour on the pages. “The imagery perpetuated a narrow definition of beauty, which is why I had to create #saggyboobsmatter,” she says of the hashtag she launched last year that grew to become a movement.“It impacted me because it made me feel like I was never going to be good enough and that I had to be a particular type of woman in order to receive the type of love that is glorified – you know, men professing their love with grand gestures for these beautiful women who look so ine and perfect,” she says. “I always felt like I’m not ine or perfect, so that means I’m not going to get the love I want. And if I do want that love, I’ll need to look different.”Her breasts became a lightening rod. “They were the main issue because when I’d go out to get bra fittings done, the models on the packaging never looked like me. Their boobs didn’t look like what my boobs looked like. So, even when I’d get the bra that was being pushed in my face, I still wouldn’t have the desired result, so it created a complex in my mind,” she says.Eventually, she realised the only way to conquer it was to own the very qualities she initially viewed as flaws. “It forced me in the direction of having to be content with my own beauty, because if I didn’t do that I would be living and walking in a shadow of myself. I wouldn’t have known joy or what it’s like to feel confident in myself. I wouldn’t have known that the world is definitely not going to come to an end,” she says. “In fact, the world will come to an end if you refuse to accept yourself, because all you’ll know is a version of yourself that other people have told you to be and why do those people have authority over who you are?”The message behind the #saggyboobsmatter movement resonated on social media, generating more than 8,000 Instagram posts from women around the world sharing their own everyday body narratives in response to Eggerue’s extraordinary honesty. The pace with which the hashtag spread was proof that social media’s cult of perfection had lost its lustre.When Victoria’s Secret received criticism for a fashion show that relied on tired, reductive and restrictive notions of female sexuality, it was Eggerue’s hashtag that journalists referenced as an example of how times have changed. Women no longer aspire to Barbie doll proportions and Kardashian-esque curves.Eggerue’s profile has grown alongside a community of like-minded, equally prominent women on social media such as the trans model and activist Munroe Bergdorf @munroebergdorf and influencer Megan Jayne Crabbe @bodyposipanda, an attractive woman of size known for posting videos in which she joyfully twerks, shakes and rolls her ample love handles, hips and thighs.“I’m never going to stop talking about Munroe because she shows up so boldly,” she says. “She’s tenacious, courageous and paves the way for other women and I just think her presence is so important in modern society. I can’t imagine where I would be without knowing she existed. And Megan opened up a massive conversation about beauty ideals and fashion accessibility. She has about a million followers and she basically became popular for making videos where she would jiggle her body to music in her underwear and as a plus-size woman that’s something you rarely ever see. I learn so much from watching her Instagram stories alone.”Most likely, others feel the same way about Eggerue. The BBC recently included her on its annual 100 Women list, honouring trailblazers in their field. “I remember when I was laughed at for creating #saggyboobsmatter,” she wrote in an Instagram post announcing the news. “Now, I’m being referred to as a leader among legends!” A new breed of woke fashion influencer?

As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we meet a new breed of activists, such as ex-gang member Karl Lokko, who demonstrate just how important this is. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3When Karl Lokko was 12 years old, his life took its first swerve towards danger. He saw someone shot for the first time, on Brixton’s Myatts Field estate, the south London housing block he called home. For years, the estate had earned a reputation as a place where families and children lived in the crossfire of local conflicts. And for a time, it seemed as though Lokko would commit his life to the gang culture that seemed to thrive in his area. Now, though, he considers that estate one of the most meaningful places in his life.“It had a terrible reputation – branded at one point by the press as the ‘Devil’s Den’,” he says. Even then, it was still the backdrop for the childhood games he remembers playing with friends: “Knock down ginger, 4040 home, run outs and park-swing Olympics.” It’s also where Lokko met Pastor Mimi Asher as a young adult – the woman who would eventually turn his life around.And that’s where Lokko’s story leaps from the everyday into the extraordinary. He didn’t follow a route carved out for him, leading away from school and into life on the streets. Instead, the 28-year-old found himself – and a new focus – as close to home as the gangland distractions. He’s grown into one of several inspiring Londoners who’ve used their combination of experience and personal knowledge to turn well-known spaces and activities into life-changing sites of positive change.In Lokko’s case, that came down to how Asher refocused his energy, leading him to a very different life. As in giving TEDx Talks, striking up a friendship with Prince Harry and working as a charity ambassador. By grabbing his life by the lapels and steering it in a new direction, the poet, activist and influencer has matured into someone who’s able to see the mundane in a new light. Lokko credits Pastor Asher for nudging him away from criminality. She would open her flat on the estate to him and other vulnerable young men. And inside, she ran a Christian faith group, which she described to the  as being less about God and scripture and more “about helping to give young men identity, value and something to believe in”.Other innovators similarly use their surroundings as a springboard for community work and making a positive impact. Fellow poet Momtaza Mehri takes inspiration from her London upbringing and Somali heritage to write forceful works that vibrate with the capital’s energy. As this year’s young people’s laureate for London, she tackles everything from gentrification to race, street violence and the living, breathing history of her city. Mehri says her writing is invested in “questions or ideas around disruption or movement, whether it’s movement of people or places, movement between different ideas, between how things change over different generations, and in themes of migration and urban spaces”.Elsewhere in the city, Tanya Compas and Charlie Dark work in separate disciplines but both help their communities see themselves in newly affirming ways. Compas is a youth worker, who – through workshops, events and education – empowers young women of colour to see their worth. She’s won several awards, and is one of the Evening Standard’s 1,000 most influential Londoners. Dark founded Run Dem Crew, a running group that began to help inspire young men of colour that has now turned into a city-wide phenomenon in London.Finally, groups such as Muslim Girls Fence – using the sport of fencing to break down stereotypes about Muslim women – and the Big House, bringing isolated care leavers into theatre production, show what can happen when collectives help amplify marginalised voices. As Sarah Saaed, a teenage Muslim Girls Fence mentor put it, the programme “gives me power. It makes me feel like I have strength and I am powerful, and I’m strong and resilient.” Both programmes excel at allowing their participants to see themselves anew.As for Lokko, he’s developed his poetry and songwriting around the city since Asher demonstrated how Myatts Field estate and the wider community could provide inspiration rather than stir up fear. Take the underground, for example: specifically, the Victoria line’s southernmost stop. “As a Brixton boy, any commute across the city started from this point. But what became apparent to me after a while is that poetry was always a by-product on these trips,” says Lokko.And so he wrote the majority of his first poetry collection, The Butterfly Effect, zooming along in tube carriages, he says. “The underground was where people made contact but rarely connected. The British reserve gave way for silence on crowded carriages that would usher, for me, creativity.” Anyone’s surroundings can turn into sites for new potential – you just have to be willing to see your world with fresh eyes.Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1f57467f125c8dce0e7d68e97bb60710e02d20e/0_250_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a4f54c7b5899ac3703f2b3f246ccb30","title":"cautious consumers chinese economy slows","story":"Deserted high streets show that after decades of breakneck growth, the world’s second largest economy is falteringFew people are shopping at the Beijing Yintai Centre, a high-end mall in the Chinese capital’s central business district. Store clerks say foot traffic has been low, even when holiday discounts were offered. Office workers walk past empty shops like Hermes, Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana and Cartier, eating fruit they have brought for lunch.Li Xin, 33, who works for a security company nearby, likes to check out the selection of handbags. Her favourites are Chanel and Tom Ford. But recently, she has decided to cut back. “This year I didn’t buy any new bags, because everyone has been saying: ‘Winter is coming’,” she said.For the many businesses that depend on the spending power of China’s middle class, winter has already arrived. After decades of breakneck growth, the world’s second largest economy is slowing down, and Chinese consumers are feeling the pinch.Many have seen their savings wiped out in peer-to-peer lending scams, as Chinese stocks reached new lows last year, and as the property market, the largest store of household wealth in China, declined.As a result, Chinese shoppers are abandoning iPhones for cheaper Chinese-made smartphones, buying fewer Swiss watches and travelling less. Many couples have decided against having a second child because of the cost. The term “consumption downgrade” has become popular online, as netizens swap advice about how to save money.China’s slowdown is the result of a government campaign to rein in excessive debt and calm property prices. “Then came the trade war, which hasn’t had a huge direct effect on the economy, but has eliminated the sense of certainty and stability central to business and consumer confidence,” said Scott Kennedy of CSIS in Washington.What Chinese consumers can and cannot spend matters. Domestic consumption accounted for a little more than three-quarters of economic growth last year. As manufacturing and trade are hit by the US tariffs, the country’s policymakers are looking to its citizens to offset those losses.“Consumer spending plays a very important role. If it falls, the impact on the economy will be large,” said Ye Tan, an independent economist and analyst based in Shanghai. In theory, spending begets more spending as companies take more orders, produce more, and workers go home with more money in their pockets, according to Ye.“The whole process forms a virtuous cycle and people will have more confidence,” she said. “Confidence is really important.”Yet confidence is thin on the ground. The core areas of Chinese consumption – property, durable goods such as electronics, and cars – have all seen sharp declines over the past year.Last year, car sales contracted in China, the world’s largest auto market, for the first time since 1990. Retail sales in November grew at their weakest rate in 15 years. And at least one in five apartments in China are empty, according to Gan Li, a professor at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu.International companies that rely on Chinese shoppers have begun to sound the alarm. Apple issued its first profit warning since 2002 on the back of slowing demand in China. Ermenegildo Zegna said it would be holding back store expansion in the country, one of its largest markets, because of the expected downturn.“There is a need for some other sector to step up and provide leadership of the economy. The much hyped Chinese consumer should be the most obvious candidate to do so, but rather than pick up the slack, retail and services appear to be following manufacturing down the rabbit hole,” said Shehzad Qazi, managing director of China Beige Book International.The government is trying to restore confidence by cutting inidual taxes and lowering mortgage requirements. In the northern province of Hebei, the government has proposed a four-day working week to encourage spending. City officials in Beijing are asking retailers to stay open for longer to foster a “night economy”.Property developers have slashed prices, while electronics retailers have begun offering discounts on iPhones. Economists say these measures will take time to have any meaningful impact and some analysts expect further stimulus measures to boost the economy. Others say the structural problems in the Chinese economy cannot be fixed so easily. “Turning on the credit spigots alone won’t fix the problem,” said Kennedy.On a Friday afternoon, the Apple store in the Sanlitun shopping district in Beijing is full, while a nearby store selling Huawei phones sits mostly empty. A worker at the Genius Bar says the store is usually even busier that today. Another store clerk says that while traffic is as much as it usually is, there is not the same clamour for new iPhones. When the latest model came out in October, there was no queue outside the store.Some argue that the idea of a “consumption downgrade” is overblown and that falling iPhone sales are no barometer of the broader economy. “Apple has been losing relevance in the Chinese market for a variety of reasons in recent years. The brand no longer excites Chinese consumers,” said Pan Yiling, senior editor of Jing Daily, which focuses on the Chinese luxury market.Pan says China’s middle class consumers are becoming more strategic. Those who enjoy luxury brands are cutting back on impulsive purchases and choosing more carefully.Lu Wei, 28, who works in a radio station in Beijing, decided to opt for a fake Louis Vuitton bag to add to her collection. It cost her about 900 yuan (£103), which she says is about 10 times less than the real version. “I suddenly realised that I am no longer young. I have to save some money.”China’s wealthier middle class will remain less affected by the downturn. A lawyer in the Yintai Centre, who give only her surname, Hu, brings her one-year old son here to a play and learning centre that costs 388 yuan (£45) per visit. Hu and her husband have been thinking about ways to cut back, for instance on their annual international trips. One concession Hu has made is to shop more on the e-commerce platform, Taobao, something she used to find embarrassing before.“Being brainwashed by consumerism is not a wise option for ordinary people like us,” she said. “Trying to get the best products with less money is not something to be ashamed of.”Additional reporting by Wang Xueying"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7dcbb442a06a00b68736485fa54c9b96ceaf3db/0_22_5290_3175/master/5290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd3798f121663b49572278586fc34771","title":"kumbh mela worlds largest festival lost and found","story":"As an estimated 15m Hindus gather at convergence of holy rivers in India, the huge lost-and-found centres go digitalby  Michael Safi in PrayagrajDay and night, through crackling loudspeakers, the announcements ring out. “It is Babu speaking,” says a shrill voice. “I have lost my wallet and brother. Please come here the moment you hear this.”“Lal Ram is here,” a woman says a few times. “Come and collect him from the yellow tower.”“Whoever has taken my trousers, that were drying on my car,” booms a voice in Bengali. “At least return the car keys from the pocket. You can keep the trousers.”It is the first day of the largest human gathering ever. An estimated 15 million Hindus have come together at the convergence of the Ganges and Yamuna – two holy rivers in north India. Up to 10 times that many – more than the population of Russia – could bathe in the waters by the end of the festival in March.Children step between thickets of adult legs. Older pilgrims walk hunched over, eyes fixed to the ground. They and millions of others will be carried along in vast human waves to the water. Hundreds of thousands will get lost on the way.“We calculated last time we had 225,000 missing people,” says Devesh Chaturvedi, the head of the team that organised the last Kumbh Mela in the city, in 2013.High above the festival grounds, a pop-up city of tents and dusty roads about two-thirds the size of Manhattan, two giant yellow balloons hover. They mark the two lost-and-found centres that have become operational so far. By mid-morning, one centre is already heaving with lost men, women and children.“After taking a dip I felt sick and couldn’t get back to my group,” says an older man named Papon. He was found wandering in the crowd, freezing and in his underwear. “I’m wearing someone else’s clothes now,” he says, pulling a blanket around himself.“For the last 24 hours I haven’t eaten,” says Shripath, burying her head in a green shawl. Barely able to walk, she was put on the back of a motorbike the previous day by her brother. He said he would meet her closer to the river, but they lost each other.She knows the name of her village, but not which state or district it is in, and does not know any of her family’s phone numbers. She has been lost before at another festival in the mountains of Uttarakhand. “I wish I had never come,” she says. “Just take me back to my village. My grandchildren are there.”Twins who become separated at the Kumbh Mela and rediscover each other decades later was once a stock Bollywood storyline. Folks tales abound of heartless families taking burdensome older relatives to the festival and abandoning them there.In reality, most of the lost are found. This year the operation has gone digital, including an app with live updates of every new registered missing person.“The biggest challenge we face are the people,” says Mamta Tamboli, a manager with the IT firm running the lost-and-found system. India has 22 official languages and an estimated 720 dialects. Most who attend the Kumbh Mela hail from small villages they might rarely have previously left. New India, with its sleek software solutions, keeps crashing up against the old.Those who are never reunited or go missing permanently may be mentally ill or could have chosen to run away, he says. Others go missing for even darker reasons.“We have studies now that show at large events the risk of trafficking increases,” says Dhananjay Tingal, from the child’s rights group Bachpan Bachao Andolan, which is working at the festival.No data has been collected, but he knows from experience at other Hindu fairs that traffickers see the events as opportunities. “You see the large number of children moving around the area, or working with their parents,” he says. “In a crowd moving like that, a child who falls even five paces behind cannot be seen.”Uguonkar says his team is aware of the risks. He recounts a story of a boy who was lost at another festival he worked at. A man claiming to be his uncle arrived at the centre to collect him.“An assistant asked the boy: ‘Do you know this man? Do you recognise him?’” he says. The child hesitated. “So we said no, we aren’t handing over.”By the end of the first day, all who were in the lost-and-found centre in the morning had been reunited with their families, except for Shripath and another older woman beside her. In a few hours, they will be handed over to an organisation for destitute women.“Nobody is coming to pick us up,” Shripath says. “I’ve been crying so much I can’t open my eyes. Just put me on a train and I’ll get home myself.”Additional reporting by Kakoli Bhattacharya in Prayagraj"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46d7656253788741ec45e079da2b3d45345c7b72/0_0_3243_1945/master/3243.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a297d36397d48a7c0b1e655a2669405b","title":"libya reconciliation conference delay could fuel military solution","story":"Political process is being sabotaged by those who believe conflict is only option, says UN special envoyFailure to hold a national reconciliation conference in Libya could open the path to those who want a military solution to the country’s isions, Ghassan Salamé, the UN special envoy has warned.The conference, which was due to be held this month, is intended to be a precursor to presidential and parliamentary elections this spring designed to end the splits that have paralysed the country ever since the ousting and killing of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.Speaking to the UN security council, Salamé refused to set a date or venue for the conference, instead saying he was working night and day in the hope of it being staged “in the coming weeks”.With fighting still dogging the country and political isions entrenched, Salamé said it was vital that the conference was held “in the right conditions, with the right people”.But he warned: “There will be those who seek to undermine the national conference and its outcomes, particularly iniduals who hope to delay elections so they can remain in their seats.“Without the concerted support of the international community, spoilers will sabotage the political process and undo any advancement. If this were to be allowed, Libya’s progress would be set back years and almost certainly open the doors to those who believe only there is a martial solution to Libya’s wounds.”The chance of holding the national conference has been set back by the breakdown of a four-month-old ceasefire in the capital of Tripoli and political infighting between key institutions, notably the house of representatives and the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA).Renewed clashes between armed militias around Tripoli have seen 10 killed and more than 40 injured. There are also isions growing within the UN-recognised GNA that may be fuelling some of the Tripoli fighting.Salamé said: “We can fight fires, but eventually there will be an inferno that cannot be extinguished, so we must go beyond and tackle the underlying dysfunctionalities of the Libyan state. The political deadlock has been underpinned by a complex web of narrow interests, a broken legal framework and the pillaging of Libya’s great wealth.”Salamé has been reluctant to identify those he believes are holding the country back, but the UN has already imposed sanctions on some militia leaders.Libya, like many countries in the Middle East and North Africa, suffers from external actors interfering in order to fuel violence or jockey for influence.In the impoverished and largely lawless south-west, Marshal Khalifa Haftar has launched a military campaign that his spokesman claims is trying to stabilise the major oilfield and defeat forces being supplied by Turkey and Qatar.But he admitted that much of law enforcement remained in the hands of armed groups instead of professional security officials. He also made no mention of reports that a 2019 budget for the Libyan government had yet to be agreed due to disputes about spending priorities between the central bank and the government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b995a8405c7fcb69364f310a31edf04dcff70df4/3_126_3628_2176/master/3628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b5e2b2f12bf359e642874d621d093e6","title":"indias kumbh mela festival in pictures","story":"Thought to be the world’s largest human gathering, more than 20 million Hindu pilgrims ritually bathed on the opening day of the festival"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"The first significant career choice you make will not necessarily be life-determiningRegister your details now \u0026ndash you can determine your final course preferences laterMany students receive financial help but preparation is key when it comes to securing the correct level of fundingAvoid the traps: Parents can offer vital support, but their knowledge is often outdatedWhat factors should you consider when deciding on what career path you wish to takeMultinational firms concerned over standard of foreign languages among school-leaversWe talk to graduates who made the wrong call when they filled out the CAO formTimeline for the 2019 college application processThousands to apply for courses ahead of this month\u0026rsquos application deadlineDownload PDFs of our comprehensive list of level 8 and level 67 courses"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Dr Ali Selim says mosque has \u0026lsquovery severe procedures\u0026rsquo for dealing with radical viewsCaptured Irish passport holder Alexandr Bekmirzaev among group of Isis sympathisersCouple say they were told anomaly was fatal before hospital dubbed it \u0026lsquocomplex anomaly\u0026rsquoCoombe says medics not of opinion foetus would die before or within 28 days of birthPublic expenditure secretary claims health counterpart should answer Oireachtas questionsMinister of State Se\u0026aacuten Canney says no need for an independent inquiry into subsidenceFact Ireland\u0026rsquos agriculture is mostly grassland-based is positive, says Alan MatthewsGovernment applies to European Commission to carry out detailed economic analysisAllegations about the sale made by Murphy in D\u0026aacuteil led to establishment of commissionDoctors and politicians say medical professionals not legislators should make decisionAli Charaf Damache would be the first person to have citizenship revokedWoman in critical condition after shooting on Lower Dromore Road, WarrenpointPassengers taken by bus from Portlaoise to DublinPreparations ongoing by sourcing medicine via various routes from Europe, says MinisterTeacher unions unhappy with Government proposals that address lower pay rates for staff recruited after 2011North Antrim MP received over \u0026pound6,000 for flight and accommodation on New York tripDPP sought to keep Cork man, who raped wife and cut off her hair, behind bars\u0026lsquoWe will miss him dearly and we send our thoughts and condolences to his family\u0026rsquoFergal Keane pays tribute to native city during ceremony for Hall of Fame award"},{"url":null,"title":"soloheadbeg ambush what really happened in january 1919","story":"Now 85, Dimphne Brennan, in her own words, has disliked few people in her life. However, she makes an exception for Dan Breen, the man linked most frequently to the Soloheadbeg ambush a century ago this weekend.“I have quite a degree of contempt for the way he has lied all the time about what went on then. He deliberately set out to do his best to make my father look bad. He didn’t care about how many lies he told,” she declares.Breen and Seán Treacy are most famous for the ambush in Tipperary on January 21st, 1919, when two Irish Catholic Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) constables were shot dead as they escorted gelignite to a local quarry.However, they did not lead the Soloheadbeg attack, which was not authorised by the First Dáil, but which is regarded as the opening shots of the War of Independence.Instead, it was led by Dimphne Brennan’s father, Seumas Robinson, a native of Belfast, who had been elected by the members of the Third Tipperary Brigade to take command in October 1918.So prominent are Breen and Treacy in the iconography of Irish republican history that many are surprised to find out that they were not the ones in charge at Soloheadbeg.It did not stop Breen arguing that planning for Soloheadbeg had little to do with Robinson. Robinson had been a “yes man” and a “stooge”. His presence at Soloheadbeg was “accidental”.Breen’s words rankle with Robinson’s daughter to this day. Now 85, she is the last surviving of Robinson’s seven children and has never before spoken in public about her father.The man she knows as “Daddy” died in 1961 at the age of 72. He had been a TD and senator in the Free State and later set up the Bureau of Military History to record the memoirs of those who had been active in the revolutionary period.The enmity shown to her father by some in Tipperary was down to his outsider status. Robinson was born into a republican family. His grandfather fled to France after the 1848 rebellion and his father and mother were both born in that country. They returned to Ireland.Robinson joined the IRB in Glasgow and took part in the Easter Rising. He was sent to Tipperary to organise a group of men who were enthusiastic but not experienced in the ways of warfare.“They were misbehaving and not doing things properly,” Mrs Brennan believes, “He was to go down and try to put some discipline on them so he was unpopular from the start.”Her father, she argues, was a moral man – a trait stemming from his early days in a seminary in Scotland where he trained to be a monk. He left in 1913 intent on being an Irish revolutionary.“He was the gentlest, kindest person you could ever meet. He never raised a hand to anyone of us ever. He was nothing but good. There was nothing judgmental about him. He was a moral man.”Questioned about her father’s involvement in the War of Independence, she replies: “I often thought about it and at some stage did think about how you can kill people that you don’t even know.“I don’t know how I would behave if I was back then.“Looking back with a moral judgment on it, you’d say, ‘Ooh, did they do that?’ But if you are in the midst of it, it is different.“He was intellectually, morally and religiously convinced he was doing the right thing. He must have had a ferociously stubborn gene as well,” she told The .Later, he insisted that the gelignite seizure was legitimate and that the constables, James McDonnell and Patrick O’Connell had been killed when they refused to surrender and tried to fire back.Robinson’s evidence is directly contradicted by Breen, who baldly stated that the aim was to “kill someone and we wanted to start a war”. Such a claim is an affront to her father’s memory, she insists.“Daddy thought that was a bloody awful reason for doing it,” says Mrs Brennan, “I have heard my father say it so often from his mouth. It was accidental and should not have happened. There was never intention of killing them.”Mrs Brennan will attend this Sunday’s Soloheadbeg centenary commemoration, where she will meet some of the relatives of the two constables. “Boy, do I think that’s right that they will be there,” she said.Robinson was also involved in an incident at Knocklong in May 1919 in which members of the Third Tipperary Brigade rescued their comrade Séan Hogan from a train. Hogan had been arrested the previous evening and was being taken by armed guard to Cork Barracks for questioning over the Soloheadbeg incident. Two RIC officers escorting Hogan were shot dead in the ensuing gun battle.Hogan fell on hard times afterwards , setting up a vegetable farm in Dublin which failed. He ended up living in Robinson’s house for two years: “He had nowhere else to go.“He never got over what happened. His nerves were shattered. We were all just kids and we didn’t disturb him in his room. He didn’t talk to us,” recalled Mrs BrennanHowever, her father lived his later life with serenity: “My father was comfortable with himself that it had to be done and he did it. The biggest thing about him is that he went back into the monastery in his head.“He retreated back into that and that is why he was such a kind and gentle man. You wouldn’t have been able to place that man as the military man that he was,” she remembers.Next Monday, January 21st, is the 100th anniversary of two defining events. That day in 1919, the first shots were fired in the War of Independence when two policemen were killed in an ambush at Soloheadbeg in Co Tipperary. In Dublin, meanwhile, Dáil Éireann met for the first time. Gathered in the Mansion House for a meeting that drew worldwide attention, members made a declaration of independence and adopted the Democratic Programme, a radical agenda for the republic.On Monday, The  will publish “1919 – War and Peace”, a 48-page supplement covering the events of that year at home and abroad. From political manoeuvrings in Dublin and London to the aftermath of the first World War, and from the Amritsar massacre in India to the Paris Peace Conference, it covers all the major themes of the period, with special study guides for junior and senior cycle students.Among the pledges contained in the Democratic Programme adopted by the first Dáil was that the Irish republic would be judged by its ability to offer dignity and security for its children. On Saturday, The  will launch “No Child 2020”, a nine-month project that looks at how that ambition can be fulfilled 100 years on.A commemoration of the decade of revolution 1912-1923.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA Wire It is one of the great triumphs of Irish diplomacy – placing Ireland’s concerns at the heart of the EU’s priorities in the Brexit negotiations.And the EU has not flinched in its solidarity and commitment. It has backed the backstop to the hilt.But with a no-deal looming and chaos reigning in London, what is the future for the backstop now? If the UK moves on its red lines of leaving the customs union and the single market – a move being openly touted in London and for which there is significant support in the UK parliament – will the backstop move too? Dublin is starting to think about this.In one sense at least, the backstop has been – so far anyway – a failure.It was conceived to solve a problem: how to conclude a withdrawal agreement to allow the negotiations move on to the future relationship between the UK and the EU. It combined the British impatience to move the negotiations on, the Irish mistrust of the Brexiteers’ concerns for Northern Ireland and the EU’s tendency to kick problems down the road.But now it has become a problem in itself.A device that was meant to facilitate progress has become a barrier to it. This is primarily a problem caused by Britain. Prime minister Theresa May, after all, has repeatedly agreed to the backstop and now cannot pass it in her parliament. But it is a problem nonetheless.So how did we get here?The close result in the British referendum was not reflected in the direction charted by May after she took over as prime minister from David Cameron. Instead, Remainer May was keen to burnish her Brexiteer credentials and set a course for a hard Brexit – out of the customs union, out of the single market.At the same time she insisted that there would be “no return to the borders of the past” in Northern Ireland, that the British government would protect the gains of the peace process and safeguard the Belfast Agreement.And so, as the deadline of December 2017 for “sufficient progress” on the withdrawal agreement – which would allow talks to begin on the British priority of the future trading relationship – loomed, May and the EU agreed the backstop.In a nutshell the agreement said that in the absence of another solution for the Border, Northern Ireland would effectively remain within the EU customs union. By the time that political agreement came to be expressed in the form of a legally binding treaty a year later, May had persuaded – yes, this was her idea – the EU to extend the backstop to cover the entire UK, not just Northern Ireland. It is often forgotten that this backstop was May’s idea.The backstop has always been hailed as a political victory for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar – not least because his Government enthusiastically promoted it as one at home.Domestic support for the backstop has been universal – to the extent that the Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald was this week warning the Taoiseach against diluting it in the slightest.Criticism of the move has come from a minority of commentators within the political and administrative apparatus, any questioning of the strategy is expressed only in hushed tones.But very quietly, some senior sources have privately acknowledged that there is a potential flaw at the very heart of the Irish strategy – that holding out on the backstop risks bringing about the very thing it is designed to avoid: a no-deal and a hard border.Another Leinster House observer wonders: “How is it a negotiating triumph if it presents the other party with something they cannot agree to?”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The guest list for the Taoiseach’s birthday party has been putting noses out of joint. Photograph:  Julien BehalIt’s been like living through the opening scenes of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory this week in Leinster House, with a cast of increasingly forlorn Charlie and Charlene Buckets haunting the precincts in search of a Golden Ticket. The Taoiseach’s 40th birthday bash is on Saturday night.It’s 24 hours too late, but Friday was a working day. He spent the morning touring primary schools in north Co Dublin with local TD Alan Farrell, collecting birthday cakes everywhere he went.In the afternoon, he was in Ballymun with TD Noel Rock, where he got four more birthday cakes. We’re not sure what the atmosphere was like between Leo and his two deputies, but perhaps not as warm as usual.His much-anticipated 40th celebration has left quite a few members of his parliamentary party bereft. This is because the guest list is rather small, leaving some feeling highly insulted because they didn’t make the cut.Olfactory organs are considerably out of joint. The venue for Leo’s party is a closely guarded secret. Guests swear they have not been told the location and that the Taoiseach’s partner Matt will inform them where to go at the very last minute via the special WhatsApp group set up for the occasion.On Friday afternoon, the chosen few were informed that they will be partying in Dublin city centre. This WhatsApp group has caused consternation. It was set up a couple of weeks ago by Leo himself, who picked more than 30 names to go in his group. Naturally, they all presumed they’d be in on the birthday bash. In the meantime, they were told that cardiac surgeon Matt would be organising things.Then, last weekend, inidual invites were sent to some, but not all members of the group. This meant that people who didn’t get a Golden Ticket were able to see the ones who did, and vice versa.“Talk about rubbing our noses in it,” sniffed one Fine Gael backbencher, whose nose couldn’t possibly have been rubbed in anything. At this stage, it’s so out of joint it’s vanished up his ear. Not that anyone really cares, of course. This is the Taoiseach’s birthday and he can pass them by if he wants to.Really, it’s cool. Or at least it was, until emotions got the better of some on Monday night after the parliamentary party’s pre-season think-in dinner in Fire restaurant. A group then repaired to nearby Kehoe’s pub for a nightcap.Talk soon turned to the WhatsApp group, and soon turned bitter, as names were traded of those who had and hadn’t been invited. With a few drinks on board, the real feelings about Leo’s birthday list came out, with one politician reportedly bursting into tears at being snubbed in such an unfair and hurtful manner.There were dark mutterings from some who had believed, or felt they had been led to believe, they were closer to Varadkar than now seems the case. It didn’t soothe ruffled feathers to know that the gilded few with the Golden Tickets, or Varadkar Vouchers, barely numbered a dozen, or that most members of the Cabinet didn’t get an invite.A former senior minister who is often described as “close to the Taoiseach” is said to be “still raging”.The only Ministers invited, so far, are Simon Coveney and Simon Harris, Eoghan Murphy, Paschal Donohoe and Josepha Madigan. The old guard are conspicuous by their absence.The Taoiseach has protested to close colleagues that he knows very little about his party, but that hasn’t stopped TDs from fretting that the Golden Ticket holders hold the key to the Cabinet reshuffle that Leo had promised for early summer. It was, after all, Leo who set up and chose the members for the WhatsApp group. Junior minister Helen McEntee and Senator Neale Richmond, both of whom have worked closely with the Taoiseach on the Brexit issue, are invited, as is Martin Heydon, the chairman of the parliamentary party.Along with a young Varadkar, Kildare South TD Heydon was a leading member of the all-male “five-a-side” group of ambitious first-time TDs elected in 2011 who used to meet in the Merrion Hotel’s Cellar Bar to discuss policy.All week, there have been dejected mutterings from the Overlooked.On Friday, they were still checking with each other to see if anyone got a late call-up.“I can’t believe he did what he did. Politically, it’s the most stupid thing ever. Quite the own goal,” confided a backbencher on Thursday. “If he had just sent text messages, then everyone wouldn’t have seen who was left out. It’s so public. People are fuming. And then there’s all the ones who are disgusted because they weren’t even put in the bloody WhatsApp group in the first place. I can tell you, this won’t be forgotten fast.”The National Gallery seemed such a lovely venue for Fine Gael’s special parliamentary party meeting on the eve of the new Dáil term on Monday. All the arrangements were put in place well in advance, with media registration completed the week before due to security considerations.So it was a surprise to get an email late on Sunday evening from the press office advising of a change of venue. Fine Gael’s TDs and Senators gathered instead in the nearby Alexander Hotel, which accommodated the party at very short notice and facilitated the smooth running of the think-in. But why the sudden move?It seems the National Gallery was under the impression that a full-scale Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting was not a party political event. At the last minute, having enquired with headquarters whether the occasion would be used to disseminate a particular political message (it would), the gallery regretfully had to cancel the booking. The backroom boys were bemused. “What did they think we were going to be doing? Trooping in to look at the Caravaggios and naked statues? Learning how to draw?”Over in the Alexander Hotel, climate change was discussed during the morning sessions, and the afternoon was given over to issues of party organisation. Speakers included John Paul Phelan, director of elections for the local elections in May Regina Doherty, who is director of elections for the European elections and Donohoe, who is the overall director of organisation.This is a powerful position – it’s Phil Hogan’s old post – and should see Paschal as head honcho whenever the general election comes around. After their deliberations, Heydon, chairman of the parliamentary party, hosted dinner in a packed side room at Fire restaurant in the Mansion House.There was, of course, a cake for the Taoiseach in advance of his big birthday. It’s a safe bet that quite a few of his deputies and Senators (the ones not on his party list) didn’t take a slice, for fear it would choke them. The parliamentarians were joined for the evening by about 20 of the party’s eager new general election candidates.This, we hear, added a certain edge to proceedings, as wary incumbents determined to retain their seats icily eyed ambitious constituency rivals at the far end of the table. They included Minister of State Mary Mitchell O’Connor and her running mate in Dún Laoghaire, Cllr Barry Ward CavanMonaghan TD Joe Reilly and youth activist Sandra McIntyre and Senator Colm Burke, who will be contesting Cork North Central along with barrister Julie O’Leary.Harris couldn’t stop talking when we caught up with him on Friday. The Minister for Health hardly paused for breath when asked how he feels about becoming a father for the first time. His wife Caoimhe gave birth to Saoirse (8lbs 11oz) in Holles Street at 9.31pm on Thursday night. “People tell me how life-changing it will be, but I suppose you don’t realise how much until it happens. Saoirse is absolutely beautiful. We can’t wait to bring her home. It’s nerve-wracking, though, I so want to be a good dad.”He was quick to correct some reports that his new daughter shares the same birthday as the Taoiseach. “She doesn’t, but she does with Michelle Obama – what a role model for her.”And why Saoirse? “We chose that name because we want her to have the freedom to be whoever she wants and aspire to do whatever she wants.”Simon says he’ll be back at work this week, but he’ll be trying to balance his commitments with spending as much time as he can with Caoimhe and Saoirse.“I’ll never get this time back again.”The Dáil hits a century on Monday and the Oireachtas is holding all sorts of events to mark this major milestone in Irish history. Such is the significance of the anniversary, Dáil Éireann is actually going to sit on a Monday.There’s a special centenary sitting (on January 21st, 100 years to the day) in Dublin’s Mansion House, scene of the Dáil’s first public meeting, when those elected representatives who were able to turn up – many could not – declared Ireland a Republic and sovereign independent State. (A fact, sadly, which still eludes some Brexiteers across the water.)Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl has thrown himself into the spirit of the occasion and will be hosting a number of events in and around Leinster House as the year progresses. On Thursday, he welcomes the members of the Oireachtas press gallery to a dinner in the Members’ restaurant. The menu includes an option to dine from the simple but hearty menu which was available in 1919 – hairy bacon, anyone? The event not only celebrates the centenary but also “the role of the Oireachtas press gallery down through the ages”.As part of the Oireachtas 100 programme, a special brochure has been produced featuring a timeline of key moments in our young democracy. Everything is in it, but if you skip to the end you will see major events from the last year. June 21st, for example, is the date on which Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, addressed a joint sitting of both Houses. October 21st was the date of the referendum on the 37th amendment to the Constitution – the one to do with blasphemy.But the most momentous happening of all, under the heading “October 2018” is this: “The Oireachtas has moved from Lotus Notes, used since 1992, for email and migrated to OutlookExchange.”A key moment in our democracy, for sure. It’s even made it to one of the large display boards of seminal moments lining the walls of the temporary external corridor between Leinster House and the new Leinster House 2000 complex. The walkway is in place while restoration work is carried out on the old building. The move from one computer programme to another isn’t even completed yet, but the transition has caused deep trauma among many TDs and Senators.“It’s like moving from low babies to high babies, but maybe less traumatic. It makes dealing with emails and our diaries a little easier, I suppose,” said one TD, bearing up well under the strain."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3762914.1547829134!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit has unleashed such a set of demons on the uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSt George flags in the windows and a “Vote Leave” poster on a house in Redcar, northeast England, in 2016. Photograph: Scott HeppellAFPGetty ImagesTo stay or to go is no longer a binary question in Britain, if it ever was to begin with. Between those two poles, there are myriad shades of opinion. There are the remorseful Leavers. The regretful Remainers. The more-hardline-than-ever Leavers. Those who are so fatigued by it all they no longer care what happens.Then there are the uncategorisable views: like that of the Romanian-born, German-raised, British-dwelling recruitment consultant I spoke to this week, who brings workers in from eastern Europe to do the jobs British labourers won’t, and who still thinks Britain should leave the EU because he’s nostalgic for the old days. It was easier to make money back before the UK’s borders were fully open to eastern Europe, he says.Or the thoughtful and articulate secondary school students who would have supported Remain if they had been old enough to vote, but now feel Britain should leave regardless of the consequences, because it can’t be seen to be weak. Or the university student who is too young to share Nigel Farage’s view of the “real” England as a place of verdant fields and cricket pitches, but does anyway.Or the immigrant communities in Bradford who are perplexed by Brexit, and see it as an “elitist, London” thing. Or the woman I met in Hull, who voted Remain but couldn’t talk about it to her husband, and was secretly hoping for Leave. Or the schoolboys in Bradford who were angry at older Leave voters. “It’s like someone else choosing a movie for you on Netflix, and they leave halfway through, and you can’t change the movie. That’s what old people voting for Brexit is like,” one of the boys said.The man in his 20s checking me in at my hotel in Leeds voted Remain his girlfriend Leave. He is frustrated with the leave-at-any-price conversations he is hearing. “You wouldn’t say I’m sick of trying to sell my house, it’s taken two years, so I’ll sell it for any price.”After the shuddering, drawn-out Brexit earthquake finally comes to an end, all of these people will still have to live together, some of them under the same roof. How does a society that has been so badly fractured begin to heal? And what does all of this mean for what constitutes British identity in a post-Brexit Britain?“The wider ramifications of Brexit on national identity are huge. A whole generation of people will identify politically not in terms of which political party they support or oppose, or by whether they are left-wing or right-wing – political identity will be shaped by the position taken in the 2016 referendum,” says Dr Parveen Akhtar, a lecturer in politics and international relations at Aston University and the author of a book on political participation among British Pakistani diasporas in multicultural Britain.One of the lessons from all of this is “be careful what you wish for”, says Prof John Curtice of the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. “We spent 20 years worrying about people not being engaged in politics. Now we’ve got a population that’s heavily engaged.”And, it could be argued, a country that is more ided than ever. Curtice points out that those isions are not unique to Britain, but “part of a wider debate that’s going on about the process of globalisation”. What is emerging everywhere is “a ide between that section of our society for whom freedom of movement is an opportunity, and those for whom open borders are a threat, and immigration is something that happens to them.”Most observers of British politics and society I spoke to believe that what happens over the next few months may prove crucial in determining how deep the rifts run.Prof Jon Tonge of the University of Liverpool, who is the co-author of a book about the DUP, believes that, ultimately, a “second referendum may come to be seen as the least evil option”. But that’s not to say it’s a good outcome.Then again, nobody here is talking about good options anymore. A second referendum, says Tonge, is in many ways “a horrible option, that would be monumentally isive and would tear the country apart. It would cause a great deal of anger. But it wouldn’t be unprecedented.” He cites referendums on devolution in Scotland and Wales, and the Lisbon treaty in Ireland.Whatever happens, he is not optimistic that the isions created by Brexit can be healed within a generation. “With Brexit, David Cameron has unleashed such a set of demons on this society. This cannot be healed easily. It’s horrendous. If you talk to people in Scotland, they’re still smarting from the independence referendum. You need to multiply that several times at least to understand the impact of Brexit.”Prof Rob Ford, who specialises in the areas of public opinion, electoral choice and party politics at Manchester University, believes that Britain, ultimately, is unlikely to crash out without a deal, but that negotiations will go to the wire. And while the politicians battle it out, the isions in society are deepening.“We’re seeing an increasing weariness and growing entrenchment among the voting public. On the Leave side there’s a substantial chunk who think leaving with no deal is desirable. On the other side, there’s a chunk of Remain who want the whole thing overturned,” he says.“The identities of Leave and Remain have lodged themselves very firmly in the public consciousness”, and have created an environment where the discourse from each side is passionate, focused and increasingly polarised.The example of Scotland gives Ford hope that the ruptures appearing in British society may not be as permanent as they now seem. “Although the independence vote still weighs heavily there, the referendum had a limited mark on the identity Scottish people have about themselves.” It ided society, but “it didn’t change how the Scots saw themselves in relation to the English”.It is “quite possible,” he says, that Brexit “leaves a lasting mark on our politics, but it doesn’t necessarily change how the British see themselves”.There are some who believe a shattering of the notion of British identity would not ultimately be a catastrophe. Javaid Iqbal, a legal professional working in the multicultural city of Bradford, says that perhaps people are too quick and too eager to define what Britishness is.“They want something they can hold on to, they can clasp, they can say ‘This is what it means to be British’. But I don’t think there is any single definition of it any more. We can’t use the Farage idyll of pubs and sheep and valleys and farmyards any more, if it ever existed.“Britishness is defined by a set of values and ideals, rather than race, religion, class or background. It’s patience, inclusivity, democracy. For me that’s Britishness.”Whether even those values can survive the Brexit earthquake, however, is far from certain.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

He was asked if the EU would insist on customs checks on the Border in the event of a no-deal Brexit in March. “Well, it will take time, but Border controls would be the consequence of a no-deal scenario,” Mr Krichbaum said.Asked if preparations were already being made by the EU, he said: “Sure. From the European side the preparations are running because we have to take into account that another solution can be found. “We hope that a solution will be found, and if the time can be used in the next weeks we are very open for this idea, but now it’s up to Theresa May to present her plans and her intentions.”Asked if Border checks would be “instructed” by the EU, Mr Krichbaum replied: “These cannot be avoided because it is an outside border of the European Union. It will be the consequence if Great Britain will leave the European Union.”However, he said that the checks would be done “under the responsibility of the national authorities”. “Because you know certainly well that the European Union does not have a competence to control the borders. It will be a hard border of the European Union, but this is the consequence if we have not a member state any longer in the European Union.” Meanwhile, Britain’s international trade secretary Liam Fox admitted Britain may not be able to replace any of the EU’s trade deals with 40 big economies in time for a no-deal Brexit on March 29th. Dr Fox’s admission came as British prime minister Theresa May met members of her cabinet to report on the talks she held with Conservative backbenchers and MPs from other parties in recent days. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has refused to meet the prime minister until she rules out leaving the EU without a deal.Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson faced criticism on Friday when he claimed that he had not said anything about Turkey during the 2016 Brexit referendum. In fact, Mr Johnson raised the prospect of tens of millions of Turks being allowed to move to Britain a number of times during the campaign despite the fact that Turkish membership of the EU is a distant prospect.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyComment: A glorious celebration of cheap imitationsAt least 20 killed in pipeline explosion in central MexicoRobert Mueller\u0026#39s office denies report Trump ordered Cohen to lieSocial media allowing women to cheat botox screening questionnaires, warns NHSIt\u0026#39s not too late to have flu jab, pleads country\u0026#39s top doctorR.

BT\u0027s package includes broadband with an average speed of 145Mbs, line rental for phone and broadband, and free weekend calls. Last night experts said BT\u0027s prices were dangerously confusing, adding that it was unfair that the cost of providing unnecessary landline and calls was being automatically built into packages.Dani Warner, broadband expert at uSwitch, said: It is disappointing that some providers continue to insist that their customers must subscribe to a service which they don’t use and, in many cases, don’t actually want.“While providers may say that the cost of landlines is essentially free, giving consumers a choice about which services they take is important, and we’d expect customers to be able to tailor their subscription as they require.Full fibre broadband is changing the way consumers interact with the internet and consigning buffering to the scrap heap. Alongside the rise of smartphone use, the way we use voice services at home is changing, and ever decreasing numbers of people use or even need a landline.David Hickson, director at the Fair Telecoms campaign, said: One of things we\u0027ve always resented is that telecoms firms build line rental into the cost of a certain bundle of calls. At BT it means anyone who pays line rental to gets inclusive calls. BT is able to set the price at zero by bundling it in with the line rental. You could say that is dishonest, as it distorts the value of price bundles.Furthermore the fact that the break point between the broadband service and landline connection is indeterminable, resulting in a dangerously confusing situation for consumers.  It comes as demand for landline phones has plummeted in recent years, with total annual call time nearly halving from 103 billion minutes to 54 billion minutes between 2012 and 2017.    Over the same period, mobile calls rose to 148.6 billion minutes.So far nearly 2 million homes have access to full fibre broadband, with the figure set to rise to 15 million by 2025, according to Ofcom.A spokesman for BT said: “The vast majority of our customers have landlines and make calls as well as using the internet in their homes every day. When customers sign up for broadband, the price of the service includes the line rental to make the price as clear as possible.We’re currently not seeing the demand from our customers to take fibre without home phone lines, but we will continue to review our products and services to make sure we’re providing our customers with the best products and services for their needs.”  At least 20 killed in pipeline explosion in central MexicoRobert Mueller\u0026#39s office denies report Trump ordered Cohen to lieIt\u0026#39s not too late to have flu jab, pleads country\u0026#39s top doctorSocial media allowing women to cheat botox screening questionnaires, warns NHSR.

Ruusalepp was part of a generation that had access to computers and the internet for the first time. She spent her days scouring foreign laws relating to digital signatures and cherry-picking the best parts for Estonia.Estonia to collect DNA of citizens to give personalised health adviceHow Estonia can solve Britain’s biggest socio-economic problemEstonia plans to give robots legal recognition“I knew basically nothing about the technology, but because Estonia just gained independence, we were in a state where we had to build up the country and all available resources were in the use,” Ruusalepp remembers. “You can imagine if you give freedom to these kind of crazy youngsters and they could put the whole state online – which happened – I was just happy to be a part of it.”The experience gave her a love of innovation, even in unchartered territories:\u0026nbsp“That’s something you get for your whole life.”\u0026nbspRuuselepp spent five years working for the Estonian government afterwards. “Those were wonderful years,” she says. “It opened up the whole new world for me in terms of having colleagues who were not afraid to make things happen and launch new things.”The Tallinn Stock Exchange, which she joined\u0026nbspjust as it was preparing to merge with the Helsinki Stock Exchange in 2001, proved another opportunity for entrepreneurialism. “Back then we were just crazy young people working for the stock exchange, growing it, launching new products, launching new everything,” she says, blue eyes sparkling across the table backstage at TechCrunch\u0026nbspDisrupt Berlin, where she is on a panel.\u0026nbsp“I remember working day and night and going out to all the parties.”I know how much effort we put into investor education and how many lawsuits we had because people didn’t understand what price to go with. The stock exchange always gets the blame!By 2013, Ruusalepp had stepped back from her position as chief executive of the Tallinn Stock Exchange, which became part of NASDAQ in a 2008 merger, to join the board. She took maternity leave – a generous 18 months – and realised that she had travelled very far from her passion for innovation and entrepreneurship.She had been at the Tallinn Stock Exchange for 12 years and had seen it grow from an agile, independent business to a small part of NASDAQ’s machine. She was comfortable in a way that might ordinarily appeal to someone with a very young family – but not Ruusalepp.“There are different stages in a company,” she says. “One is the building and scaling and one is sustaining or keeping. I’m not the keeping person. I get bored.”At home and walking the streets of Tallinn with her newborn, Ruusalepp decided she had three options: go back to the corporation, move out of the country to do something different and more challenging, or to go it alone. Tempted by the third option, she began to think about market opportunities in the finance sector. It didn’t take long to land upon education. \u0026nbsp“I know how much effort we put into the investor education,” Ruusalepp says of her time at the stock exchange, “and how many lawsuits we had because people didn’t understand what price to go with. The stock exchange always gets the blame!”How airlines are using blockchain to unlock frequent flier milesFacebook’s cryptocurrency plans boosted by blockchain hiring spreeHow to use blockchain to clean up the world’s oceans Ruusalepp had an idea to build a game to teach young people how to use the stock market. She could build it for teenagers to trade with assets they would find exciting, like startups. Within weeks, Ruusalepp realised that she was building more than a game. Funderbeam has evolved into a platform for investors to fund and trade startups, or high-growth private companies, with enough liquidity, or activity from buyers and sellers, so that traders could get in and out of the market when they want.People have attempted to build stock exchanges for startups before. The Alternative Investment Market, or AIM, was launched as a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange in 1995 for smaller companies that\u0026nbspwant to list shares publicly. Other private markets exist for investors interested in crowdfunding startups, like Seedrs, but do not include the option to trade their share.Ruusalepp says the lack of liquidity has prevented these platforms from taking off. “I’ve seen the transformation of stock exchanges, turning from growth capital into exit engines. That has been the philosophical and fundamental change over the last maybe 15 years,” she says.Funderbeam is built to make it easier for investors to support early-stage startups. Ruusalepp and her team set out to remove the risk that investors might find their money stuck for a decade until the company grows big enough to list publicly. It looks like a regular crowdfunding platform, where companies can make their case for investment.The EU country where you can become an e-resident for €100But, unlike Seedrs and other crowdfunding platforms, Funderbeam investments are tradeable at any time. One major technological advance has made this possible: blockchain.\u0026nbsp“The blockchain solves one thing in the industry and that is trust,” Ruusalepp says. She explains how stock markets originated in coffee shops, where traders met in person. In the centuries since, intermediaries such as brokers and exchanges have been introduced to provide security, standing between the seller and the buyer of the shares. Blockchain, Ruusalepp says, connects the buyer and the seller again, just digitally: “It is like a new virtual coffee shop.”Around 30 companies are now tradeable on Funderbeam, including the Estonian car-sharing platform Autolevi Syndicate, which raised 130 per cent of its minimum target within 24 hours of listing in November. Funderbeam hit 2000 trades in May 2018 and by August had raised €8m (£7.1m)\u0026nbspthrough the platform, from 5,000 investors.Funderbeam has applied for its global trading licence in Singapore. “Europe, unfortunately, has built existing business models into the laws,” she explains. “Singapore has the licence to run a private exchange of private companies on the blockchain without all those intermediaries, allowing us to use the full power of this technology.”At the end of last summer, Ruusalepp moved to Singapore with her two children and her husband. Despite finding it hard to imagine a life outside her beloved Estonia, Ruusalepp\u0026nbspwas convinced by her family to make the move and the family are doing well.\u0026nbsp“My eight-year-old has said he doesn’t want to go home,” she says. “It’s like Switzerland but with palm trees!”Ruusalepp\u0026nbspwill stay at the helm just as long as Funderbeam is growing. She says it will be at least two years until Funderbeam needs “a keeping person” and then she wants to stay and work with entrepreneurs.\u0026nbsp“I hope that I could give new entrepreneurs the experience that I had,”\u0026nbspshe says. “Entrepreneurship\u0026nbspgives you the freedom to go after your dreams.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It now offers two credit cards and a fixed saver account, alongside an app that allows users to manage their money across different accounts in one place.Revolut: UK digital bank targets 10 million customers by 2020January 13 marks one\u0026nbspyear since the introduction of open banking legislation that forced banks to share customer details with rival services.\u0026nbspTandem is gaining traction alongside other digital banks such as Monzo, Starling and banking services firm Revolut in a race to acquire software that will attract users away from traditional lenders. At 500,000 users, Tandem is still significantly smaller than Monzo, which hit 1 million users in September, while Revolut has 3 million.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn January, RBS entered the digital banking market with a £2 million investment in Loot, a startup to help students manage their finances, through Natwest’s digital-only retail bank, Bo.Providers have so far failed to convert a growing number of users into profit. Tandem made a pre-tax loss of £23.6 million in 2017 and while losses narrowed in 2018, Knox says the company does not expect to turn a profit until 2020.Tandem makes money in the same way as traditional banks, by charging interest on credit. It also takes commission if a customer switches its utility bill on a recommendation. Knox says it makes less money per customer than the incumbents: £40 compared to £200 or more at the average bank. “We genuinely are trying to make you better off,” Knox says. “That’s not what Barclays\u0027 mission is.”Knox is a fintech veteran. He already had four companies to his name by the time he started Tandem in 2014 with co-founders Matt Cooper, a former managing director at Capital One, and Michael Kent, who previously worked with Knox on payments companies Small World FS and Azimo. “All of my businesses are purpose driven at some level,” Knox says. “My main mission is to sort people’s finances out.”One of Tandem’s goals, when it launched, was to help customers getting through the month without running out of money. Their market research pre-launch revealed that this was a major area of concern for potential customers. “Customers find that more of a problem than saving,” Knox says. “The solution to prevent people running out of money is aligning income with outcome. That\u0027s what we focussed on last year.”The company acquired Pariti, an app that helps users keep track of spending, in March 2018. Pariti tracks how much a user is spending on debt repayments and suggests changes to help someone pay off their debt more quickly.In September, Tandem introduced an auto-saving feature in beta. It works by topping-up transactions to send excess cash from a current account to a Tandem flexible-saver account, or by rounding-up an aggregate of transactions to set aside as much as someone can afford at the end of the week. “Lots of our customers have told us that they want to save but they can\u0027t do it,” he says. “A direct debit is inflexible.”The company is preparing to roll out the smart savings app to all customers in the coming weeks.While Tandem was built for millennials, the average customer is more likely to be in their 30s than their 20s. “Our service helps you sort out your finances and that\u0027s more likely to appeal to people in the 30s,” Knox says. “I don\u0027t know about you but when I was in my 20s I had more important things to worry about!”He describes 2018 as a year of building the business, while 2019 will be about scaling the bank internationally and integrating all of its current software into one solution. Tandem’s current suite of services is built to appeal to customers who may want to keep their current account with a main provider, while taking advantage of benefits such as free transactions abroad with the cash back credit card, or higher interest on fixed-term saving accounts.Unlike Mozo and Starling, Tandem does not offer a day-to-day spending account, or a pre-paid card. “If you have an account and want to work with new banking services, but not move your money across, our offer works better in that hybrid space,” Knox says.The absence of a pan-European bank allowing users to make transactions in foreign currency without incurring fees is one area of opportunity for digital banks. So far, European expansion has proved tricky. When Revolut started in 2015, it focussed on free overseas transfers but later moved into cryptocurrency. Monzo introduced fees for overseas cash machine withdrawals in 2018, claiming that free withdrawals were “unsustainable”.Knox says Tandem has put plans to expand in Germany on hold until after March 2019 and the UK\u0027s exit from the EU: “We were going to open deposit accounts in Germany but then we got a letter saying you’ll be illegal after March.” The company closed the few accounts that it had. “We’re going to see how it pans out,” Knox says.In the meantime, Tandem is turning its attention to Asia. In November, it announced a £15 million investment from Convoy Global Holdings, a Hong Kong-based financial advisor, putting it on a footing to open one of the first digital banks in Hong Kong. This brings the total funding raised to £39.3 million.UK bank ranking 2018: TSB falls to bottom while Monzo comes out on topKnox says Tandem will need to double its user base and become profitable before it can consider an IPO. “Ultimately, the challenge is do you have enough scale to support the overheads that being a public company brings,” he says. “Sadly just being a bank brings a massive overhead, which also means you are an appropriate size to IPO.”But it’s not just scale Knox is working towards: “Could we IPO within a couple of years? Certainly. Is it on my priorities list? I think we probably want to run private a little longer than that.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The streaming service almost doubled operating profit in the fourth quarter – it rose from $245m (£189m) in the last three months of 2017 to $447m – and revenue grew to $3.7bn from $3.3bn. In spite of the strong numbers, the company’s stock tumbled almost 4 per cent in after-hours trading. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAnalysts offered a few reasons for the share price decline, including the fact that revenue narrowly missed expectations. Meanwhile, although Netflix reported annual profit of $1.6bn, the company spent $13bn on ramping up production of original content such as Bird Box and Roma. Netflix responds to criticism for using disaster footage in Bird BoxNetflix reveals huge viewing figures for You and Sex EducationSteve Carell to star in Netflix comedy inspired by Trump’s Space ForceNetflix to raise prices for 58 million subscribers across USThe company also recently announced that it would raise subscription prices for its 58 million US users, the first price hike since 2017. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was notable that Netflix is “now confident enough to use price increases to slash its cash flow deficit even faster”.“You can only squeeze customers so far, but we think there’s a way to go before the pips squeak. The average customer spends around 10 hours a week on the service, which works out at around 25 cents an hour. Hard to argue that isn’t value for money,” he added.“The worry, of course, is that international bruisers like Disney and Amazon aren’t going to go down without a fight, and both have the financial clout to counterpunch pretty hard. The battle for viewers’ eyeballs is only just getting started.”Analysts also pointed out that Thursday’s share price movement should be taken in the context of 50 per cent stock growth since Christmas Eve. “The fact that investors reacted negatively to what amounted to a strong performance indicates the extent to which Netflix has set a high bar,” said Paul Verna, media analyst at eMarketer. “The bottom line is that Netflix remains the uncontested leader in the subscription video space.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chief among them is an activity known as credential stuffing, where the logins are plugged into a wide variety of services in a fast and automated way, in the hope of finding websites where people have re-used the stolen emails and passwords.Security experts advise people to use different passwords and change them regularly, so that stolen passwords cannot be used.

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film.

Angry at living under feudal rules, this\u0026nbspclass of mortgaged renters want the homes they paid for, says Harry ScoffinClick to followThe IndependentIllustrations by Dilruba TayfunThe sun is out in London’s\u0026nbspDocklands. In the emerging metropolis at the east side of the capital, where cranes are a permanent feature of the skyline and one-bed flats can go for up to a million pounds, trendy Hubbub Bar \u0026amp Kitchen is the last place you would expect to hear words like injustice and exploitation.\u0026nbspOutside in the beer garden, local residents gather over drinks to discuss possible names for a new self-help group. “Leasehold Freedom Fighters” is rejected for sounding too political. After some discussion, they settle on “Friends in High Places”.\u0026nbspAs the first meeting concludes, contact details are exchanged. They plan to meet again.With Canary Wharf on the doorstep, and the long-awaited Elizabeth Line set to make the West End a 12-minute hop away, it is striking to find people so unhappy with where they are living.\u0026nbspBut leasehold does not care if you are rich or poor. It preys on those who have the home ownership dream, keen to avoid paying sky-high rents.This erse group s bankers, media types, public sector and office workers, alongside retirees. Some have lived in the area long before its re-development and gentrification. While it might be difficult to shed a tear for those fortunate enough to have bought in such a sought-after location, these people have in fact found common cause with a group of northern working-class mums, who last year established the National Leasehold Campaign (NLC) to tackle similar issues.Rent arrears more than double under universal credit, figures showFrom newbuild houses on private estates across the northwest, to fancy flats in the shiny residential towers crowding the Isle of Dogs, properties originally marketed as offering ‘home ownership’ are uniting people up and down the country in a shared concern.As London expands and demand for homes across the southeast continues to grow, developers are building ever higher and at much greater densities. Leasehold tenure is exploding as more and more flats are constructed.\u0026nbspUnfortunately, many of\u0026nbspthose who do manage to leave the rental market, proudly brandishing the keys to their new home, fail to understand what leasehold means until it’s too late.When you “buy”\u0026nbspa leasehold flat, you are buying the right to occupy it for a certain length of time. Think of it as a long-term rental, with the minimum term 99 years. You pay most of this upfront. You’ll probably have to take out a mortgage to cover the purchase costs.\u0026nbspBut it’s not ‘yours’.\u0026nbspYou don’t own the flat, the building, or any of the land on which it sits.\u0026nbspYou have effectively signed up to become a renter with a mortgage.\u0026nbspEven the law calls you a tenant.The landowner, known as the freeholder, nominally owns the building and is your landlord. He or she will appoint a managing agent to run the estate, often on a\u0026nbspcommission basis. The freeholder\u0026nbspenjoys an annual ground rent from you, which is essentially\u0026nbspprofit, unconnected to services that might be provided to tenants (cleaning of communal areas, for instance), which also come at a cost.Through control of the managing agent, the landlord can choose how high the service charges are set (although the law states that charges must be ‘reasonable’). And he has the all-important power to award contracts to anyone he chooses to undertake works, irrespective of the cost, quality or (say critics) even necessity of the job. But you have to pick up the tab. Every time.\u0026nbspThere are short and long leases, with leases running down to below the 80-year mark deeply unattractive and hard to remortgage.Although your charming estate agent may suggest that a 999-year lease is as good as owning the property outright, this is still a glorified tenancy.\u0026nbspYou will still have to deal with a landlord and his agents\u0026nbspwhen things go wrong.The landlord has the all-important power to award contracts to anyone he chooses, irrespective of the cost, quality or even necessity of the job. But you have to pick up the tab“Recently we have seen an erroneous narrative being propagated that freeholders are ‘noble custodians’ of the building and\u0026nbspserve some valuable service to the leaseholders. Nothing could be further from the truth,” says Louie Burns, managing director of Leasehold Solutions. He describes them as an asset class, using feudal property laws to make themselves owners of the buildings by proxy. “They own the buildings to make as much money as they possibly can from them,” he adds. “It shames us as a nation that this feudal, iniquitous system is still thriving in the 21st century when the rest of the world have rid themselves from it.”But how could such an unjust system come into being in the first place? Home ownership falls more in UK than any other EU countryAfter seizing all land in the name of the crown, and under threat from the landowners he had just dispossessed, the new King William I had to act fast to stay in power. The year was 1067. He consolidated his regime by gifting some of his land to a highly select group of people. These palace favourites, the lords, rushed to break the freehold land into tiny parcels\u0026nbspand sell them on as leases to lesser men\u0026nbspfor agrarian use. The\u0026nbspinnovation allowed for a perpetual form of land ownership. Leasehold would continue to shape patterns of class formation in early modern England, becoming a key instrument of capital accumulation for the wealthy during the industrial revolution. As people deserted the countryside for the cities, the descendants of William the Conqueror’s noble class\u0026nbspwere uniquely well placed to seize the opportunities of this new era. With their monopoly on land, they introduced “building leases”\u0026nbspto allow for the building of flats on their estates. Hard-working people became glorified tenants, with\u0026nbspfreeholders gorging on the ground rents, license and permission fees, building insurance and maintenance charges. Fast-forward 200\u0026nbspyears, and little has changed.With nine\u0026nbspout of 10 newbuild properties being sold as leasehold in London today, this is a rigged market. If you want a flat, it almost has to be leasehold. Although there is an established co-operative mode of property ownership for flats, “share of freehold”, this has been shunned by developers and investors as it offers none of the lucrative opportunities that they enjoy with leasehold.A newer, more advanced form of tenure, “commonhold”, made the statute books in the early 2000s. Commonholders, unlike leaseholders, would own their flats outright and, through an association, own and manage the common areas collectively. With no third-party landlord, residents would be in the driving seat. They would appoint the managing agent. Curiously, London has just one commonhold scheme in existence.Although it was assumed that commonhold would ultimately\u0026nbspmake leasehold obsolete, as savvy buyers sought\u0026nbsptrue home ownership, it never took root because of vested interests and poorly drafted legislation. Conservative MP Crispin Blunt blames leaving it to the market. By splitting the land into freehold and leasehold interests, developers can sell leasehold properties to unsuspecting buyers, pocketing the ground rents through their continued ownership of the freehold, and make a fortune in the process. Still not satisfied, many choose to sell on the freehold to faceless offshore investors. What to Look for When Buying Within a Development“Profit making businesses such as housing developers cannot be expected\u0026nbspto freely and voluntarily disclose their own ‘monetisation maximisation’ model,”\u0026nbspBlunt says.The MP’s intervention raises questions about our democratic politics. Twenty years after\u0026nbspgovernment described the leasehold system as “flawed to its roots”, the question remains:\u0026nbspwhy haven’t we killed it\u0026nbspoff yet? Is the corporate lobbyist really more powerful than the consumer homebuyer?There is growing anger from leaseholders in flats who want to be free of “hold”.\u0026nbspWe hear their stories at the Isle of Dogs beer garden. They have suffered in silence for many years and paid the service charges without question. Yet because these increased\u0026nbspmodestly each year, leaseholders often didn’t know\u0026nbspwhat was happening until they found themselves struggling to sell their leases on the open market. Their home was a depreciating asset all along, even with a residential tenure supposed to last a millennium. The financial nightmare gets even worse when buildings are left to deteriorate –\u0026nbspthe condition of tower blocks has little to no impact on the value of the freehold title or associated ground rent portfolio. The freehold landlord has bought a cash machine. He doesn’t need to worry about keeping the leaseholders happy.And those leaseholders who went\u0026nbsppublic with their experience in the past risked\u0026nbspangering their neighbours, who did\u0026nbspnot want to see the value of their homes affected by negative publicity\u0026nbspsome faced threats of legal action from the freehold landlord. And when your landlord controls every element of the way your block is run, right down to whether your windows get cleaned, it is understandable that many people preferred to stay\u0026nbspquiet.Unsuspecting first-time buyers signed leases with toxic doubling ground rent clauses.\u0026nbspWhen they wanted to buy the freehold, they found it had been sold on to shadowy offshore investors\u0026nbspThings changed when the big developers applied the leasehold model to houses, many of which were made available through the government’s Help to Buy scheme. They targeted the northwest, where 69 per cent\u0026nbspof houses sold in 2016 were leasehold. Unsuspecting first-time buyers signed leases with toxic doubling ground rent clauses. And when they wanted to buy the freehold, they found it had been sold on to shadowy\u0026nbspinvestors who had either taken it off the market or quadrupled the cost.Trapped in unsellable, newbuild leasehold houses, three brave women decided to take on the industry and government. They wielded placards outside new housing developments that were being sold off-plan, warning prospective buyers to avoid leasehold products. They even had themselves chained up as they sat in mock prison cells. Politicians and the media started taking notice, with the wider “fake home ownership”\u0026nbspscandal coming under scrutiny.Half of leasehold house owners didn’t know what they were buyingJoanne Darbyshire, a co-founder of the NLC, says the campaign moved quickly to broaden its reach by articulating the experiences of leaseholders in flats. “It didn’t take long for us to realise that the leasehold scandal was so much more than leasehold newbuild houses,” she says.\u0026nbsp“Newbuild flats were also being sold with onerous ground rent terms and we learnt about the immoral and unethical behaviour of a number of freeholders. We knew the NLC had to campaign for all leaseholders.”With more than 12,000 people now part of the NLC Facebook group, which is being used to direct leaseholders to complete consultations on reform, Darbyshire and her fellow campaigners are giving those who live in flats a newfound confidence to stand up and be counted. After the northwest, London is the next highest represented area on the NLC.Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick, whose constituents are attempting to overcome collective action problems with Friends in High Places, says: “Whether it is spiralling service charges, inflated refurbishment costs, fraudulent insurance premiums, obstructing residents’ associations being formed or various other ways to cheat decent residents, including forfeiture, the rules have to change.” His Poplar and Limehouse constituency has the second highest number of leasehold properties in the country, after the City\u0026nbspof London and City of Westminster. In 2016, Poplar and Limehouse saw the highest number of leasehold properties sold across England and Wales, at 97 per cent.Whether it is spiralling service charges, inflated refurbishment costs, fraudulent insurance premiums, or various other ways to cheat decent residents, including forfeiture, the rules have to changeAnxious to ease the housing crisis, Tower Hamlets council is\u0026nbspapproving leasehold developments all the time. It\u0026nbspdid not respond to requests for data on what some have identified as a new, more disturbing trend within the murky world of leasehold. The emergence of mixed-use schemes, where squeezed local authority and prospective buyer are enticed by the prospect of building a new school, doctors’ surgery, bars, restaurants and shops under newbuild flats, demonstrates the way leasehold is taking over. Where buildings are over 25 per cent\u0026nbspnon-residential, developers have artfully curtailed residential rights to almost nothing.An investor who gains the freehold of a mixed-use building can use his total control of the service charges from the residential floors to subsidise his commercial operations. Of course he’s not supposed to do this, but the ease with which service charge accounts can be delayed and fudged, and residential spending conflated with commercial makes it a temptation few will resist. If you don’t need to pick up the tab, why would you?The freehold landlord is safe in the knowledge that while\u0026nbspleaseholders theoretically hold the power to win disputes at\u0026nbspthe property tribunal, the chances of them finding the time and resources to cobble a case together against him are slim. People have lives, families, jobs. How many can dedicate the months, if not years, a legal battle can take? And why should a flat dweller have to go to court to force his landlord to clean his windows or repair his lifts or employ decent door staff for a reasonable cost? Especially when that landlord can bill him through the service charge for his own legal costs. Yes, go to the tribunal and if you lose you cold pay both sides’ legal costs. Think of that playground game where the bully forces his victim to smack himself round his own face and you’ve pretty much got the leaseholder’s plight.And to top it all off, the tribunal is not even a court equivalent. According to Christopher Howarth, a senior researcher working in the House of Commons:\u0026nbsp“It does not have the time or interest for long and complex cases, does not take evidence on oath and is easily swayed by the legal firepower at the disposal of large landlords.”Lacking the ability to break free of “hold”\u0026nbspby buying out the freeholder, through a process known as enfranchisement, and also barred from the Right to Manage (RTM), a way of cutting out the landlord by making the managing agent accountable to leaseholders only, flat dwellers in mixed-use developments are in a special kind of leasehold hell.The Law Commission, which has been tasked by government to review the law on enfranchisement to make it “easier, cheaper and quicker”, claims there is no need to change the arbitrary 25 per cent\u0026nbsprule. As developers move away from buildings that are predominantly residential, officials seem to be turning a blind eye to the fact that many more families and young people are set to fall into the leasehold property trap. The Law Commission has been\u0026nbspinviting views on its enfranchisement. Leaseholders will certainly be kept busy, with a commission spokesperson confirming that “the Right to Manage consultation paper will be published in early 2019, and the consultation will last for two months”.They say reform is on its way. But John Paterson, a veteran leasehold campaigner, is not hopeful. He says the government has known about the outrageous racket of leasehold housing since the 1980s. But there has been no meaningful change.High hopes for rent-to-own clampdown but UK’s poorest will struggleX Factor finalists’ house for rent for £12.5k a monthWhat’s next for Generation Rent?Paterson feels sure he knows where this latest chapter will end. “The government likes to stick with 1925 Law of Property and the idea of caveat emptor.\u0026nbspIt will consider that it has warned of the problems of leasehold tenure and, therefore, if iniduals fail to heed these warnings it is their own fault.”Paterson is not far off. The current administration seems content to sit back and watch existing leaseholders face surging ground rents. It hides behind the argument that intervention would set a ‘dangerous’ precedent. However, they are not warning of the problems of applying leasehold to flats. If anything, they have embarked on “Project Save Leasehold”. While\u0026nbspThatcher, Major and Blair envisaged the end of leasehold, May’s administration defends the feudal system. The ruling party sees a cross-class alliance conspiring to bring it down –\u0026nbspand it doesn’t like it. Just last month, Heather Wheeler, the minister for housing and homelessness, claimed in parliament that “leasehold can be an effective tool for making multiple-ownership more straightforward”. Within minutes, her claim was ridiculed online. In surprising numbers, leaseholders were citing US condominium and Australian strata-title as superior models to the leasehold regime.Wheeler’s colleague, the housing secretary James Brokenshire, has demonstrated his personal commitment to “Project Save Leasehold”. He is engaging in what campaigners have called “death-by-consultation”. Not only that, he is actively sabotaging the plans of his predecessor, Sajid Javid. Private Eye says choosing to set ground rents on new leases at £10, as opposed to making them zero financial value, will ensure leasehold persists.With a housing target of 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s, existing leaseholders are pained at the thought of yet more innocent homebuyers falling into the leasehold property trap.\u0026nbspAs a party which\u0026nbspsays it is\u0026nbspcommitted to the principle of home ownership, it is ironic that the Conservatives are effectively\u0026nbspforbidding young people from owning their own homes by allowing flats to be sold as tenancies. England and Wales are the only countries left that have this feudal system. In failing to act against this burning injustice, the Conservative Party may very well be signing its death warrant.Back in the Isle of Dogs beer garden, leaseholders mention a new development going up. They call it “Desmond Town”. Richard Desmond, the ex-press baron, wants to create an income stream of more than 1,500 new homes. There will be a new secondary school, healthcare services, lifestyle facilities, and restaurants and bars. Unfortunately, residents will have no way of buying him out. And if current rules stay the same, they will have no ability to get control of their building and service charges. As London Docklands continues to be a construction site, Friends in High Places has a huge fight on its\u0026nbsphands to end leasehold for good.help to buyOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was notable that Netflix is “now confident enough to use price increases to slash its cash flow deficit even faster”.“You can only squeeze customers so far, but we think there’s a way to go before the pips squeak. The average customer spends around 10 hours a week on the service, which works out at around 25 cents an hour. Hard to argue that isn’t value for money,” he added.“The worry, of course, is that international bruisers like Disney and Amazon aren’t going to go down without a fight, and both have the financial clout to counterpunch pretty hard. The battle for viewers’ eyeballs is only just getting started.”Analysts also pointed out that Thursday’s share price movement should be taken in the context of 50 per cent stock growth since Christmas Eve. “The fact that investors reacted negatively to what amounted to a strong performance indicates the extent to which Netflix has set a high bar,” said Paul Verna, media analyst at eMarketer. “The bottom line is that Netflix remains the uncontested leader in the subscription video space.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s still us. We’re still Slack. But more consistent and, we hope, more instantly recognizable.Previous companies to spark a strong reaction for changing its logo include\u0026nbspAirbnb, which replaced its lowercase \u0027a\u0027 logo for a looping design in 2014.People were quick to point out the new logo\u0027s apparent similarity to various parts of the body – one in particular.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An exclusive survey for The Independent shows that a fresh vote received more support than any of the\u0026nbspfour other options put to the public, including allowing\u0026nbspthe prime minister to go back to Brussels\u0026nbspor a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit.The survey by poling organisation BMG Research also suggests that more people oppose\u0026nbspMs May’s deal than back it, although the prime minister can take some comfort in the data showing a softening of opposition.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

The long answer is a bit more complicated, but is still \u0026nbsp“no”.Turkey is officially a candidate country to join the EU – so you might be forgiven for thinking it is likely to join the EU.The twist is that it has been a candidate country since 1999, and since then more than a dozen other countries have joined while Turkey has not.In reality, Turkey’s application has made no progress for years, and has been officially frozen for some time – most recently again in November 2016Why are talks stalled or frozen?Turkey is widely perceived to have taken a turn for the authoritarian in recent years under President Recep Erdoğan. As such it does not meet the conditions of membership on human rights grounds. Observers say Turkey is, if anything, moving backwards on the conditions, and that doesn’t look like it will change any time soon.On paper Erdoğan is still committed to joining the EU, but the accession process is very formal and Turkey has made little progress in meeting milestones set by the bloc. \u0026nbspAdditionally, many EU states have similar fears and prejudices to the ones Vote Leave tried to play on in the UK during the EU referendum – the underlying message of which is that a large, mostly Muslim country should not be admitted to the union.Created with Sketch.

Only the sleeping bag is left as a sign of what might have beenAngela Merkel and other leaders have specifically said they would veto Turkey’s membership. This situation appears unlikely to change for the foreseeable future.\u0026nbspBut doesn’t the UK support Turkey’s membership?\u0026nbspOfficially, it does. This is because in some respects, Turkish membership\u0026nbspis aligned with the UK’s long-term strategic goals.Benefits include: keeping a large country with an eastern border in the Middle East aligned with western values and norms, and using Turkey’s perceived support for looser economic integration as a brake on the federal ambitions of other member states.Turkey is also seen as a valuable intelligence partner\u0026nbspin an unstable region where the British state sees itself as having strategic interests.It’s for these reasons that David Cameron repeatedly said the UK supported\u0026nbspTurkey’s membership – even though antipathy towards immigration was probably higher on most people’s minds.Are any other countries going to join the EU?Yes, that’s on the cards – though they’re mostly smaller. The next states on their way to join the EU are the western Balkans – places like Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo and Albania. \u0026nbspSome tentative steps have been taken\u0026nbspto integrating these countries, but they do have some way to go before they can join. Most do not yet meet conditions\u0026nbspon rule of law, economic, and human rights grounds.They are also all fairly small and could be easily absorbed by the bloc: the EU likes to think it has learned from its previous rapid expansion eastwards, which led to immigration causing disquiet in some member states. Other problems with rule of law in recent joiners such as Hungary and Poland have also caused the EU to be more cautious about accepting new members.\u0026nbspOf the western Balkans, Serbia and Montenegro are both candidate countries who have begun negotiating. Macedonia and Albania are candidates but have not started negotiating, while Bosnia has applied. Kosovo’s sovereign status is disputed but it is a seen as a potential candidate.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

The government can take a lead and rule out ‘no deal’ now, in the process ending the grotesque waste of £4.2bn on ‘no deal’ planning.“It is also not encouraging that, as well as refusing to take ‘no deal’ off the table, No10 spokespeople and cabinet members have so far ruled out any movement on a new customs union with the EU, which would be necessary for a new deal to win support in parliament.”Downing Street’s refusal to budge on its so-called red lines “reinforces the\u0026nbspview that these are not genuine talks”, the Labour leader added.Liberal Democrat leader\u0026nbspVince Cable, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford and Plaid Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville-Roberts were among the parliamentarians who met with Mrs May following her offer.But there seems to be little progress on a fresh Brexit plan after the Conservative government’s Withdrawal Agreement was rejected by 230 votes in the Commons.The prime minister remains caught between two warrring factions of her own party.\u0026nbspAdding to her problems, Nick Boles, an influential Conservative MP,\u0026nbspwarned on Friday that members of the government would resign to support a cross-party members bill\u0026nbspaimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit.The MP told the BBC that\u0026nbspnon-Cabinet\u0026nbspministers\u0026nbsphad\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbsphim\u0026nbspthat they would\u0026nbspwould\u0026nbspquit\u0026nbspif\u0026nbsprequired to vote\u0026nbspagainst\u0026nbspa bill allowing MPs\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspdemand Article 50 be extended for fresh talks with Brussels.“There is a bandwagon rolling, it’s got a lot of momentum behind it and I very much hope that any MP who shares my view that a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspwould be a disaster, will jump on board,” he said.\u0026nbspThe bill is due to be tabled by Yvette Cooper on Monday.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the plan for further cross-party talks appears to have fizzled out.\u0026nbspNo further meetings are\u0026nbspplanned and Downing Street said the prime minister would instead be meeting with “a large number” of her cabinet this week, both in small groups and in one-to-one conversations.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Failing this, a general election will be called.The last time a motion of no confidence successfully received the required support of MPs was in 1979 - by just one vote. After the motion passed - defeating Jim Callaghan’s minority Labour government - MargaretThatcher emerged victorious in the resulting election, with a clear majority.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A team of specialists who are tasked with piecing together the iconic dinosaur Dippy unpack bespoke crates containing the bone structure at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow.

wait until the process of leaving the EU concludes before considering the matter further’Click to followIndy PoliticsTheresa May will consider\u0026nbspaxeing the Human Rights Act after Brexit, despite promising she is “committed” to its protections, a minister has revealed.The government will decide on the future of the landmark legislation once “the process of leaving the EU concludes”, a letter to a parliamentary inquiry says.The wording was described as “troubling” by the Lords EU Justice Sub-Committee,\u0026nbspwhich warned the letter\u0026nbspcasts doubt on repeated pledges to protect the European Convention on Human Rights\u0026nbsp(ECHR).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Is the government sincere in its commitment to the ECHR?”, asked Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws, the committee’s chair.“If so, why has it failed to give assurances that it will not repeal or reform the Human Rights Act, which in essence incorporates the rights set out in the ECHR into domestic British law?”Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting appeals to UK public to stop BrexitThe committee wrote to the Ministry of Justice after the alarm was raised by the wording of the political declaration, which was agreed with the EU in December alongside the legally binding orce deal.The declaration said the UK would merely agree “to respect the framework of the European Convention on Human Rights” – dropping the previous pledge of being “committed” to it.In response, Edward Argar, a junior justice minister, wrote: “The difference in wording does not represent a change in the UK’s position on the ECHR.“A central tenet of our future relationship with the EU is our mutual belief in the importance of human rights and fundamental freedoms.”But he then suggested that the Human Rights Act could be scrapped when Brexit is concluded.“Our manifesto committed to not repealing or replacing the Human Rights Act while the process of EU exit is underway,” he wrote.“It is right that we wait until the process of leaving the EU concludes before considering the matter further in the full knowledge of the new constitutional landscape.Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: “This new Conservative threat to repeal the Human Rights Act and withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights is a scandal.”Before the act was passed in 1998, anyone who believed their human rights had been breached could not pursue a ruling in a domestic court – and had to go to Strasbourg.Pushed through by Tony Blair’s government, it is hailed by many as among his finest achievements, but is a bete noire for many Conservatives for giving too many rights to criminals and even for undermining personal responsibility.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all

that pulling out would jeopardise a future security dealThe peers said it would imperil human rights if the government “intend to break the formal link” between the UK courts and the EHCR.Baroness Kennedy said: “Again and again we are told that the government is committed to the European Convention on Human Rights, but without a concrete commitment, and with messaging that is changing and becoming diluted.”There is suspicion because the prime minister has previously backed leaving the ECHR, expressing frustration there was no Commons majority for doing so.In her 2016 Conservative leadership campaign\u0026nbspshe said she believed ECHR membership had made it harder to deport terror suspects and criminals.Johnson claims he ‘didn’t say anything’ about Turkey during Brexit‘No plans’ for cross-party talks to break Brexit deadlock, says No 10Nigel Farage urges Brexiteers to prepare for second referendumMay tells Corbyn ruling out no-deal Brexit is ‘impossible’On the eve of the Brexit referendum, Ms May said: “The ECHR can bind the hands of parliament, adds nothing to our prosperity, makes us less secure by preventing the deportation of dangerous foreign nationals – and does nothing to change the attitudes of governments like Russia’s when it comes to human rights.”She became an opponent when she was home secretary during her attempts – which eventually took eight years – to extradite hate preacher Abu Qatada to Jordan to face terrorism chargesMs May, then the home secretary, tore into the Human Rights Act in 2013, blaming it for the long delay in extraditing Qatada, a radical Islamist cleric.He was first jailed under anti-terror laws in 2002, while living in London as an asylum seeker, but was described as a leading extremist and al-Qaeda associate.Never convicted of a crime in the UK, the future prime minister protested it was “unacceptable” that Qatada’s removal had taken 12 years and cost over £1.7m in legal fees.She blamed the European Court of Human Rights, in Strasbourg, for having “moved the goalposts” by establishing new, unprecedented legal grounds for blocking his deportationIn a statement released on Friday night a\u0026nbspMinistry of Justice spokeswoman did not deny the Human Rights Act could be scrapped.She said that leaving the EU would not change the UK’s “longstanding tradition of ensuring rights and liberties are protected here and abroad”.The country was “committed to membership” of the ECHR post-Brexit, she added, saying that Equality Act rights for minority groups, including LGBT people, would still be protected.The

Every potential bomb, even ones suspected of being hoaxes must be treated as a threat.A recent study on the mental health of bomb disposal operators found that up to  per cent of serving and former personnel could be suffering from PTSD.The study was conducted by the Felix-Health Group — Felix is the Army codename for bomb disposal officers.At least  serving and former operators took part in the anonymous survey.The report states that members of the bomb disposal force may be “more susceptible to PTSD because of the repetitive exposure to traumatic situations”, such as the threat from terrorism and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.One serving bomb disposal expert said: “We are incredibly busy. Every day there is a team somewhere on a task around the UK.“They might be dealing with a suspected terrorist device or a pipe bomb, which can be lethal, which has been built by a teenager after downloading a bomb making manual from the internet.“We also accompany counter-terrorist police on every operation these days because in many cases they will be targeting a terrorist suspected of making bombs.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even worse, it would deny us the right to walk away from these new arrangements without the EU’s say-so.May’s dodgy deal would reduce the UK to a vassal state, a bossed-about colonial outpost of the Brussels ­oligarchy. The people voted for Leave, yet May offers us Remain by another name, a deal that sells out Brexit.For the PM to so wilfully ignore the cry of her people is a sucker-punch to the most basic principles of democracy.But it gets worse. The MPs who plan to revolt against May’s deal in the ­Commons today will not do so to protect Brexit.They are not taking a stand against May’s deal to defend what .million of us — the largest bloc in British ­electoral history — voted for in June : A clean exit from the EU.No. They see taking down May’s deal as the first step to taking down Brexit itself.Whether it’s Europhile Tories or Labour, SNP and Lib Dem MPs who have long loathed the idea of Brexit, an army of parliamentarians plan to knock down May’s deal so they can set about knocking down Brexit.So the real ide in ­Parliament today is over how to stop Brexit.The main thing our MPs will disagree on today is whether Brexit should be killed off by May’s shady deal, by extending the Article  process or even with a second referendum, as anti-May MPs would prefer.Think about this. Think about what it says about the state of British politics.The people vote in historic numbers to leave the EU. Yet the political class plot and conspire to make sure we do not.It is hard to think of another time in living memory when politicians have been so ­spectacularly out of touch with public sentiment — and so ­sinisterly cavalier about overriding our democratic wishes.There are honourable exceptions, of course. From Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg in the Tory camp to Kate Hoey on the Labour benches, some MPs will opposeMay’s deal precisely because they believe in Brexit and plan to carry on fighting for it.But a majority of MPs fall into one of the two Brexit-phobic camps — whether it’s May’s “Remain by another name” or those who would stop Brexit entirely.Some MPs are terryingly upfront about their distaste for the democratic process and their disgust with us, the pesky ­electorate.In an unhinged online rant, Labour MP Clive Lewis branded Brexit a “racist endeavour” and said “we need to end it, now”. Let’s be real about what this means.Ending Brexit means overturning the largest vote in British history. It means ending the right of ordinary people to have a say in Britain’s future. When MPs like Lewis scream, “Stop Brexit!”, they are really saying: “Stop democracy!”Labour’s David Lammy is also open about his desire to overthrow the largest act of democracy in our history.He described the vote for Brexit as “madness” and says MPs must “bring this nightmare to an end”. By “this nightmare”, he means the ­public’s reasoned, ­democratic request to leave the EU.This is the depth of the ­contempt some MPs now feel for ordinary people. They see our political beliefs as a “nightmare”.On the Tory side, people such as Anna Soubry have not been shy about their hatred for Brexit. On Sunday Ms Soubry posted a chilling message on Twitter.She said Parliament has “historic” business to take care of this week and reminded everyone that under Section  of the Public Order Act, it is an “arrestable offencea person uses ­threatening or abusive words”.In essence, she is warning the masses to stay away from Parliament, to not even think about protesting.It is testament to the arrogance of the political elite that they can openly call for the overthrow of Brexit and warn the little people they might be arrestedthey get too angry about this blatant assault on our democratic rights.“Know your place, plebs.” That is what they are saying.The extent to which Parliament is ­conspiring against the people can be seen in Speaker John Bercow’s ripping-up of parliamentary rules.Last week, Bercow let MPs vote on an amendment to a motion put ­forward by Tory arch-Remainer Dominic Grieve.The amendment, voted through by  MPs to , would force the ­Government to come up with a Plan B within three daysMay’s deal is defeated in the Commons.It should be noted here that Grieve has changed his tune.In his election message to constituents in May  he declared: “The decision of the electorate in the referendum must be respected and that I should support a ­reasoned process to give effect to it.”Now he is saying it is “the biggest ­mistake of our recent history”.As one commentator astutely put it ­yesterday: “It’s precisely this sort of ­sophistry that ­created the backlash that led to Brexit in the first place.”The BBC has stated that Grieve’s ­amendment means MPs who are “plotting” against Brexit would have “more space in which to work”. Thanks to Bercow’s unprecedented move, backbenchers will have much greater ­leeway to hamper and even kill off Brexit.It is believed anti-Brexit backbenchers are planning to table an amendment that would give their motions priority over Government motions.This would not just dramatically change how Parliament has always operated — it would let backbenchers scupper a No Deal Brexit, perhaps even force through a second ­referendum.Some are referring to this as a coup — an attempt by certain MPs to take back control from the Government and also from us, the public.As one senior Government figure said: “This could be ‘game over’ for Brexit.”Democracy is hanging by a thread in this country.Last year, MPs celebrated the th anniversary of women and working-class men getting the vote. This year, they are using their clout to overthrow ­something millions voted for.The hypocrisy is staggering.In today’s battle between MPs who back May’s Brexit betrayal and MPs who want to go even further in ending the “nightmare” of Brexit, there will be one clear loser . . . democracy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To allow Brussels,it wanted, to keep us bound hand and foot forever in the Irish backstop, unable to forge our own independent trading policy.It would rapidly have become clear to the Leave majority that their decision, while nominally honoured, had been sold down the river. That we had not truly left the EU and maybe never would.More practically it all but guaranteed the collapse of the minority Tory Government since,it had somehow passed, the DUP would have withdrawn their support.The Government was always going to lose heavily. The discredited Commons speaker John Bercow ensured it by refusing to select any amendments to the Bill that might have helped narrow the margin of defeat.It was another low for a man who has already brought disgrace to his historic office by abusing his powers to help engineer the destruction of Brexit. Parliament will be a better place without him.But let’s not pretend it would have made much dference. The deal was fatally flawed.Mrs May’s response to the vote last night was feisty — challenging Parliament to find a viable alternative that could win a majority and honour the ­referendum. No one has a clue what that would be.And her call for MPs to “listen to the British people” was dead right.Outside Westminster, the public just wants Brexit done. They are aghast at the political games.The Sun reluctantly believes we must head for a clean break, finalise preparations as best we can and batten down the hatches.We never wanted a No Deal. It would mean a tough and probably damaging few months. But it would be the only solution left which defends what should now be paramount and most precious to us all: Our democracy — and the public’s faith in it.None of the alternatives does that.  They neither honour the referendum, nor are possible to sustain.They are all damaging in their own way. Yet our Remainer-dominated Parliament will fight tooth and nail to secure one of them and thwart a clean break, in direct conflict with millions of voters.The Norway-Plus proposal, however its champions spin it, is EU membership without the voting rights. No independent trade ­policy. No end to free movement.It is a short-term Remainers’ Brexit which would lead to only one ­conclusion: A new and irresistible clamour to exit properly.Another Tory idea is to lure Labour support by offering the permanent customs union they want with the EU, abandoning all thoughts of independent trade. It is a potentially suicidal idea which could destroy their Party and put Corbyn’s Marxists in power.Then there’s the toxic second referendum which would upend our democracy, shatter trust in politicians for all time and burst fully open our national isions.Its only upside is that Leave would probably win again. Plenty of the more sensible Remainers have seen through the EU now — and dislike the blatant unfairness of overriding a democratic mandate before it has been enacted.But what would the question be  Remain versus a deal already now rejected by a monstrous Commons majority as bad for Britain And whatRemain DID win  It is staggeringly naive to imagine that would settle it. Why should Leavers accept it  The wounds would never heal.Labour appears almost ready now to buckle to its europhile members and back that second vote — and its betrayal of millions of left-leaning Leave voters will finally be complete.Shadow Cabinet ministers are already teeing it up, laughably attempting to deflect blame by claiming Tory failure gives them no option. Don’t believe a word.The Tories have dedicated nearly three years trying to see Brexit through while Labour have tried to thwart every effort and their Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer has secretly lobbied relentlessly for a ​new referendum. Labour will own every ounce of the betrayal their working-class voters will feel — and will richly deserve the ballot box backlash.Mrs May has had the hardest task of any Prime Minister since Winston Churchill, trying to fulfil the Brexit mandate with no majority in a Parliament stuffed with Remainers, some colluding with the EU to sabotage her position.Even so, her handling of it has been a woeful failure.She is clinging to power by her fingernails. And only a fool would predict now what happens  to her, her Government, Brexit or Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Disgracefully, this attempt is being led by the Gloomster of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond.This is just another version of ’s Project Fear that was launched by the Treasury to try to persuade us against voting for Brexit by prophesying disasterwe did. Some prophecy that turned out to be! Project Fear Mark II is just as ridiculous.That said, Brexit has always been primarily about politics, rather than economics. The strongest argument for it is quite simply that we should be free to make our own decisions. But there is a connection with economics, because freedom includes being able to make decisions about economic matters.Moreover,people could be persuaded that re-establishing self-government for our country would carry a heavy cost that would hit them in the pocket, many might be dissuaded from supporting it.But it would NOT carry a heavy cost. Quite the opposite. It would bring large gains.Listening to the Remainers who dominate the BBC’s coverage, you might easily believe that the EU is a raging economic success. It isn’t. Yes, it was a relative success when we joined it in . But over recent decades the EU’s relative economic performance has been poor.The reason is clear: The EU makes bad decisions, including about economic matters, because its institutions don’t work very well and it is pursuing a political project, namely the establishment of a federal state. In the process, it is pushing barmy policies of harmonisation and integration and it engages in excessive regulation. The euro is the worst of the EU’s blunders — so far. But you can be sure that there will be more.Nowhere  are countries pursuing anything like the EU’s mad agenda — no single markets, no monetary unions and no federal super-states. Unlike so many members of our elite, other countries’ leaders have noticed that the EU doesn’t work.So why are so many clever and decent people among our leaders apparently still keen that Britain should stay in the EU  There are two reasons. First, many of them simply don’t know the facts about economic performance and don’t understand economics anyway.People with little experience of business who are steeped in the world of politics or the civil service naturally tend to assume that prosperity flows from the pens of those who sign agreements. People like them. But it doesn’t. It derives quite simply from the efforts of millions of men and women and of the businesses that employ them.Yes, trade deals can be good, but you do not need them in order to trade. Currently we do not have a trade deal with the United States. Yet the US is our biggest single trading partner. Go figure!Second, many among our governing elite do not like nation states. And they particularly don’t like ours. By contrast, they have a touching faith in the EU’s ability to suppress the uglier sides of nationalism while keeping the peace and pursuing an agenda of good government for all. Doubtless they also believe in Father Christmas.If we leave the EU in March without signing a deal, we would not be “crashing out” or “falling off a clf”. Nor would it be accurate to describe this as a “hard” Brexit.Rather, it would be a clean Brexit, a full Brexit, a true Brexit, in contrast to the half-baked non-Brexit proposed by Mrs May.Mrs May’s “deal” was the Remainers’ Revenge. You only had to look at the expression on the face of Jean-Claude Juncker to know what had happened.The EU got everything while we got nothing. And we were due to pay £billion for the privilege.Now that Mrs May’s capitulation of a “deal” has been consigned to the knackers yard, we should devote our energies to preparing to leave in March without any such deal. I am not suggesting that a No- Deal Brexit would be roses all the way. There would be some immediate dislocation that would carry some costs. But they would be relatively minor and short-lived. And it would be wrong to mistake such short-term minor disruption for the eventual destination.Just like umpteen other countries around the world, we can thrive outside the EU — without anything like Mrs May’s deal.Within a few years I am sure we would look back and wonder how anyone could have thought otherwise.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was there because I tried to take my own le, I couldnt take it any more.My husband was there because of his back, its painful being in the car.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

Winston is  this year and when you reach  youre entitled to sheltered housing.However his birthday is in May and we could be dead by then. Im worried we are going to die here.Universal Credit is the Governments new flagship benefits system, but it has been slammed by charities and claimants who say it is pushing more people into poverty.Currently it takes five weeks to get the first payment, leaving many people in insurmountable debt, and working families have to pay childcare costs upfront, before later claiming back  per cent of the cost.The Sun is campaigning for the Work Allowance to be raised and the taper rate reduced to p for every £ earned to help at least four million families hold on to their hard earned cash.A spokesman for Colchester Borough Homes warned could take up to two years for some people to get a home.As a general rule this meansany applicant presents as homeless and we believe they may have a priority need, we may have a duty to provide accommodation while we look to find a housing solution that relieves their homelessness.If we do not believe they have a priority need, accommodation will not be provided but we will still assist them to secure alternative accommodation.If we are unable to relieve their homelessness, we are required to make inquiries under the full or main homeless duty.If we accept this duty, temporary accommodation will be provided and their banding on the housing register will be amended to reflect this.Applicants will then remain in temporary accommodation until they are either housed through the housing register or we end the duty by placing them in private sector accommodation.It is dficult to determine theof time an applicant will have to wait for specic property types to become available, as applicants are able to decide this by bidding on properties.In general, most applicants wait in excess of  to  months."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004345841693.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince philip continued driving hip replacement retiring","story":"The Duke of Edinburgh is said to be a law unto himself after he miraculously walked away from the dramatic crash near Sandringham, which left his x overturned.The royal source said: Prince Charles will have input from now on, as it is stressful for the Queen to make major decision on her own.The only person who he will take heed of is the Queen, who at  will be horried by this accident.A stern talking to Philip with rules from now concerning driving will be spelt out once Philip is over his shock at this potentially very serious car crash.They added: He will not be contained, he has a low boredom threshold and is now causing a problem with his wandering and off piste activities.He is basically living in Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate and runs his own timetable, his trusted staff just tend to let him get on with it.The Queen is due to leave Sandringham on February , with Prince Charles expected to have an input in what will happen with his father after that date.Prince Philip was pulled from the wreckage of his Land Rover after colliding with a Kia carrying two women and a baby. Norfolk Constabulary confirmed today they were carrying out a routine investigation.The -year-old Duke has regularly been seen driving himself or the Queen in recent years.Weeks after his hip operation last April he was photographed behind the wheel of his Land Rover appearing in good spirits at the Royal Windsor Horse Show.Looking extremely comfortable in the drivers seat, he even briefly stopped to speak to the Queen through his window.And he continued to defy expectations when he was seen travelling with the Queen in the royal Bentley to a church service in August.Prince Charles had previously told of his concern about his dads getting behind the wheel.Did you see what happened  Were you involved  Contact The Sun Online brittany.vonow@the-sun or call   .

Im always worried, Charles said, before gesturing towards Mr Thomas, and asking: But his eyesights all right But the fiercely independent royal was left shocked and very, very shaken following a dramatic crash near Sandringham.Eyewitnesses reported seeing his Land Rover flip over onto the drivers door.The Duke was pulling out of a driveway onto the A at Babingley when his car was smashed on its side.Philip - who miraculously walked away from the crash - is now being cared for by royal doctors and the Queen is by his side at Sandringham.This morning he visited the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kings Lynn for a precautionary check-up.A Palace spokeswoman said: This confirmed His Royal Highness had no injuries of concern.The Prince made it clear that his retirement from royal duties after  years in the public eye was not due to health reasons, but so he could have more leisure time.A few days after Buckingham Palace announced his retirement, the Duke, then , was out and about carriage driving at the Royal Windsor Horse Show.He has even continued to enjoy carriage driving, which has been one of his favourite hobbies since the s.Days before Christmas he was full of festive cheer as he drove a carriage out in Windsor Castles grounds.But last month he sparked health fears as did not attend the traditional Christmas Day service for the first time.Back in , the Prince hinted after he retired from competitive carriage racing he would drive around the countryside.In his book,  Years On and Off The Box Seat, the Prince wrote: You may well wonder why I have continued to compete for quite so many years.Sales director Pat Daynes, whose car had £, of damage, said: “I was leading a normal le. Then whack, I’m part of a royal soap opera.”The simple answer is that I have enjoyed every moment of it, or, more accurately, almost every moment of it. It gets me into the fresh air and it keeps me reasonably fit.I suppose I could just drive about the country but the challenge of the competition is a great inducement to get out and practise, even when the weather conditions might be a bit discouraging.Although the Prince faced a number of health scares beyond the age of , he continued to stay behind the wheel.He even drove Barack Obama around when the then US President came to visit in April .Abdominal surgery, bladder infections and a blocked coronary artery have seen him admitted to hospital on a number of occasions.Concerns were expressed for Philips health when he appeared to lean against a pillar for support while standing during the Whitehall service.But a week later he was carriage driving at Windsor on the day of his platinum wedding anniversary, and he and the Queen celebrated in the evening with a party for more than  family and friends.And this summer break he made a remarkable bounce back to health when he was seen fishing and hunting.In September the Prince was last seen taking his Land Rover out for a spin near Balmoral in September.Donning a pair of trusty spectacles, the -year-old drove alone on the A Braemar while on his way back to Balmoral Castle.Royal biographer Hugo Vickers told BBC News: Any kind of car accident at the age of  is likely to produce shock.Some years ago he gave up flying planes long before he needed to because he was scared thatsomething happened there would be a lot of criticism.You know, why was he, at the age of , still flying a plane when he should have retired at  or something like that.So he does listen to these things - hes very, very sensible.If anyones involved in a car accident, its quite a frightening thing. If he thought that hed lost concentration or something or he hadnt seen somebody he would realise hes not up to it anymore.After his decision to retire, the younger members of the Royal family vowed to rally around and support the Queen.Prince Philip completed , solo engagements at home and abroad after he assumed his title in .When the Obamas visited the UK for a state visit in , they werent escorted from their helicopter by a security driver.Instead, the task fell to Prince Philip - a keen motorist.Mr Obama was complimentary about the dukes driving skills, and said at the time: I have to say I have never been driven by a Duke of Edinburgh before and I can report that it was very smooth riding."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004607038033.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john bercow named european week eu media hero","story":"Dutch, German and French media outlets have portrayed him as a hero with videos going viral on social media.Radio France Internationale named him European of the Week for allowing MPs to table an amendment that “thwarted the strategy” of the UK Government.But Bercow faces the threat of being thrown out of Parliament after it emerges his local Tory association has began looking for a candidate to replace him, The Sun can reveal.Today the chairman of the Tory Buckingham association is meeting the Conservative party’s national head of candidate selection Gareth Fox to find a suitable figure to fight the seat.He wants the party to start advertising the position from today.The Speaker has stood unopposed in his Buckingham seat since standing down as a Tory MP in  to take the neutral role of Speaker.But the Tories are hoping he will quit before the next election to free up the seat.The move will put pressure on Mr Bercow amid the outrage over claims he is helping Remainer MPs thwart Brexit in the Commons.When he was elected in  Mr Bercow had pledged to only serve until  but has cited the uncertainty over Brexit to justy staying on.It was understood he would only extend his tenure until June this year but Tories now fear he will use the deepening Brexit crisis to cling on longer and even beyond the next General Electiona snap vote is called.But that would be the fourth General Election in a row at which the Buckingham seat is left uncontested.Buckingham Tory association chairman Cllr Clive Harriss said anger was rising among constituents over their lack of a choice for MP at elections.He said the party would traditionally only start looking for a new candidate when the Speaker stands down.But he told The Sun: “We’ve started to put feelers out with a view we’ll have someone in place soan election is calledhe decides not to stand we’ll have someone in place to fight the seat in the normal way.“I’ll be talking to central office on Friday to make sure they advertise the position.”However he admitted the party has “absolutely no influence” over when Mr Bercow decides to stand down.Mr Harriss added: “We don’t know what’s going to happenthere is a General Election.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He is happy to hang around with Stalinists and anti-Semites, Holocaust deniers and apologists for terrorism. But he won’t talk to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.The Labour leader’s refusal to discuss Brexit with his Tory — and come to that, Lib Dem, SNP, DUP and Plaid Cymru — counterparts reveals the utter smallness of the man.For two years, Jezza has been noisily demanding that Theresa May “reach out” to other parties. Yet the moment she does, he comes over all snooty and stand-offish.He won’t join any discussions about our EU policy unless and until the PM pledges that we won’t leave without a deal.That condition is absurd. Mrs May, as Corbyn well knows, is also keen to avoid No Deal. But the only way to avoid that is to agree on, you know, a deal.That’s precisely why the PM is talking to the other party leaders.The only effect of publicly ruling out No Deal — as several MPs in all parties have been pompously doing — is to encourage Brussels to dig in and thus, paradoxically, to make No Deal more likely.What explains Jezza’s sudden coolness  Is it simple tribalism of the sort that has now taken over the top ranks of Labour Immediately before the vote, for example, Richard Burgon, the Corbynite Shadow Justice Secretary, repeatedly described Conservatives on TV as “the real enemy”.After the confidence motion, another Labour MP, Danielle Rowley, posted a picture of the Conservative benches with the caption, “People are dying because of these people”.Is Corbs unwilling to talk to Tories because he sees them as evil murderers I don’t think so. Part of the old booby’s schtick is that he will talk to anyone. It’s how he justies his meetings with Irish Republicans and jihadi extremists.It’s how he justies taking money to appear on a TV station backed by the ayatollahs in Tehran.He has even said that he would be prepared to negotiate with the head-hackers of IS in order to facilitate peace.I don’t think so. Part of the old booby’s schtick is that he will talk to anyone. It’s how he justies his meetings with Irish Republicans and jihadi extremists.It’s how he justies taking money to appear on a TV station backed by the ayatollahs in Tehran.He has even said that he would be prepared to negotiate with the head-hackers of IS in order to facilitate peace.No, there is a much simpler explanation for why he won’t talk to the PM. It would force him to take a public position on Brexit. And that is the last thing he wants to do.Corbyn is an Old Left Eurosceptic. He took what was, effectively, the Moscow line during the Cold War, namely that the EEC was the economic arm of Nato.He disliked what he saw as its capitalism, and knows he will be able to implement a far more radical form of socialism once Britain is no longer constrained by EU rules on competition and state aid.He also knows that the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs want to stay in the EU.During the referendum campaign, he reluctantly went along with his party, though he made little secret of his distaste.Although we’ll never know for sure, I have a strong suspicion, looking at his face as he left the polling station, that he secretly voted Leave.Be that as it may, he has since kept the Labour coalition together by attacking the Government while saying nothing about what he would do.That ambiguity has allowed him to appease his party without alienating the millions in Labour’s northern heartlands who voted Leave.From a self-interest point of view, it made sense. But the impact on Britain’s negotiating position was dire.Labour’s tactic has been to demand impossible conditions from the Government. As Barry Gardiner, the Shadow Trade Minister, was overheard saying in Brussels: “It’s bollocks — always has been bollocks.”The trouble is, that by adopting its testicular conditions, Labour has ended up arguing for something that would represent the worst of all worlds.The main stated dference between the two parties is over the customs union. Labour says it wants Brussels to control Britain’s trade policy in perpetuity after we leave.As recently as last year, Corbyn was against the customs union on the unarguable grounds that “It is protectionist against third- world countries”.That was the reason successive Labour Eurosceptics, as far back as Clement Attlee, opposed joining the EEC.But last February, spotting an opportunity to vote against the Government without having to commit to anything, Labour somersaulted and started demanding customs union membership.Be clear: Being outside the EU but inside its customs union would be disastrous. It would keep the costs of membership without the benefits of leaving.As former Canadian PM Stephen Harper, a massive Anglophile and a Remain supporter in , put it recently: “It is really critical that this country rediscovers itself as a trading nation. If you do not do that, then frankly the Brexit experience will be bad.” When I put that point to another member of the shadow cabinet in a BBC green room, he looked at me asI was mad. We’re this close to the first truly socialist government in Britain,” he told me. “You really think we care about the customs union either way ”Yet it is precisely that cynicism that voters are turning against. People are furious at the game-playing in Westminster. They accept that MPs have dfering views, but they can tell when a party is advancing bogus arguments for purely selfish reasons.In the last analysis, Jeremy Corbyn has shown himself to be unwilling to work in what he himself sees as the national interest. That is what makes him unfit for office.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its giant firms admit they are “staring into the abyss” of a No Deal. Ireland would be severely hit.If we kill that possibility off,we tell them that we’ll effectively Remain by default, that’s it: We lose.That’s why Remainers, from Nick Boles to Hammond himself, are so keen on it.Corbyn is too because he is paralysed by indecision and just needs something to say.But the Cabinet and those MPs, Tory and Labour, who know Brexit must happen need to wake up right now.They are being played like fiddles by Brussels, aided by Parliament’s Remainers and a Commons Speaker gone rogue.They must not cave in. They must fight — or the public will never forgive them.IS anyone seriously looking for a “consensus” on Brexit What concessions have any opposition leaders offered Theresa May  They all just demand a second referendum and or No Deal “taken off the table”.Yes, the Government is sticking to its guns too. But there’s a dference:IN case there was any doubt about the nauseating Remain bias of Commons Speaker John Bercow, his new accolade extinguishes it.The continental Press have named the pompous little toad “European of the Week”.How proud he must be.Let’s hope his local Tories speed up their plans to oust him as an MP.He is not the gatekeeper of our democracy.

They are leeches. I just saw what they did on Takapuna Beach.“We know who they are. I’ve asked the council to follow up because I want to see them loaded with an infringement fine for trashing our country.“If I was Minister of Immigration I’d be trying to find a way to get these guys on the next plane.”Within hours, police and immigration officials swooped, charging Tina Maria Cash, , with theft and issuing her family, who are on tourist visas, with deportation notices on the basis of “character”.But Cash’s brothers-in-law, John and David Johnson, told local media on Friday they were “a respectable family” from Liverpool who were now too scared to go to an airport.John said: “We are hiding at the moment. We don’t know what to do.”David said they headed to New Zealand because they are fans of The Lord Of The Rings movies that were filmed there, adding: “We’re here to see the hobbits.”They also claimed that their grandfather was “the tenth richest man in England”.Both brothers insisted the trouble began because David’s eight-year-old son had been hit at the beach, leaving them to decide to leave quickly because they felt “intimidated”.And of the rubbish they left in their wake, David admitted there was “a bit of a mess left there” but added it was “not the end of the world”.John added: “I’m just a fat kid from England on holiday. If we go on holiday we treat every country like our own country, no dference.”Until the family leave, New Zealanders have banded together on social media to report on the clan’s every move and urge businesses to protect themselves.A Facebook group launched on Monday already has more than , members, and is sharing details of the family’s vehicles and providing tips on likely destinations.The tactics appear to be working, with the family turned away from one car dealership where they tried to trade in their vehicles, as well as from a motel and a beach cabin.And staff were on high alert at Hobbiton, once the main set for The Lord Of The Rings films.Manager Shane Forrest told The Sun: “We were a bit nervous and had some people in the car park keeping an eye out for them.“We wouldn’t have let them in. We just didn’t want the risk of damage or disruption to other guests.”As the family headed south from Auckland, the alert spread to the Interislander ferry, where the crew feared the clan might try to board. Spokeswoman Ahleen Rayner said: “Our staff will be keeping a close eye out for any disruption, including by groups with small boys in large hats.”The madcap rampage by the family and the Kiwis’ attempts to defend themselves has drawn some unflattering comparisons.Former police sergeant Bart Blithe, who spotted members of the group at a petrol station near Wellington on Thursday, said: “It’s like Pokemon Go, the New Zealand edition. They’ve got thousands of eyes watching them.”Mr Blithe, , who admits being barred from Facebook for  hours for calling the family “cockroaches” and “scum”, said he hoped the constant scrutiny would force the tourists to change their behaviour.He added: “I hope they will, but they seem to act like animals at home and maybe that’s all they know.”The chaos began in early December, soon after Tina Cash arrived on a six-month tourist visa on November .On December , she and another woman, along with two small children dressed in green onesies, were captured on CCTV raiding a petrol station north of Auckland.In brazen scenes, the youngsters saunter out of the front doors carrying a Christmas tree while the women grab handfuls of groceries and leave without paying.Cash was back at the same petrol station on New Year’s Eve, stealing cans of Red Bull while another woman, wearing a dressing gown, stashed a bottle of milkshake.One local claimed she had been plagued by trouble from the site for years.Too scared to be named, she told The Sun: “They copulate, defecate and urinate. It is never-ending.“It’s scary. They seem to be able to ride roughshod over everyone.”The family’s origins has been a hot topic in New Zealand, where initially locals mistook them as Irish.The group later said they were from Liverpool, but when Cash appeared in court she was listed as of no fixed address. The family has British passports.A Facebook group set up to track their movements is called Gypsy Scammers In New Zealand, but the family has denied being travellers.One of the clan, John Johnson, said yesterday: “Locals started spitting at my family, calling us names like Irish scum.“We are not Irish, we are not gypsies either.“The way we have been treated, we are scared to leave, we are scared to move.”When she ed for a third time on January , video security recognised her car number plate and workers called police.The same day, members of Cash’s group used what was to become a regular tactic, ordering meals at a local restaurant, the Backyard Bar, and “finding” ants on their plates after eating, then refusing to pay.At nearby Mr India, the family ran up a £ bill, scoffing curries and garlic naan before showing staff a hair in their vindaloo.It was the same story at Nando’s, at the Montrose Cafe, at the Coffee Club and also at the Ibis Hotel. On top of that, staff were abused and food casually thrown on the floor.Six more of the clan arrived in Auckland on January , after turning a journey from Hong Kong into what one fellow passenger described as “the worst flight of my le”.They said that while their parents drank themselves into a stupor, a nappy full of poo was stashed in hand luggage, then into an overhead locker. Shouting children ran up and down the aisle.At an Auckland hotel, manager Sufi Muhammed was appalled when he realised that, having rented the family a studio apartment, they broke into a bigger one and made themselves at home for a week.He said: “The apartment was a total mess — the television was broken, even the toilet was leaking.”On Wednesday, after a night in police cells, Cash pleaded guilty at Hamilton District Court to theft of the drinks, a wire rope and a pair of sunglasses from the petrol station. After her lawyer said she had no known criminal history she was fined  .The family has now been handed deportation liability notices, so they have  days either to appeal or leave the country before they are forcibly kicked out.Laura Clarke, the British High Commissioner in New Zealand, said: “The vast majority of British tourists who come here have an extraordinary time and behave really well and this is the exception.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For the state school is celebrating after  of its students received offers to study at Oxford or Cambridge — the second highest in the country.Brampton has left big-league, expensive public schools in its wake. Dulwich College has had  Oxbridge offers, Charterhouse just . Only Eton, with , has had more.The London Borough of Newham, where Brampton is located, has more children living in poverty — , — than anywhere  in the capital.One Brampton pupil to be offered an Oxbridge place came to Britain as an unaccompanied minor five years ago, while others have been in care or were refugees. The school’s success is an uplting tale of gted youngsters beating le’s odds.Student Dorcas Shodeinde has been in care since she was . She is elated after receiving an offer to study law at St Catherine’s College, Oxford.Rama Rustom, , who has Palestinian and Syrian parents, arrived in Britain as a refugee from Saudi Arabia in . She has been offered a place to read English at St Hilda’s College, Oxford.Victor Idowu, who is from a single-parent family and receives free school meals, will be the first in his family to go to university.The teenager, who has been in care since she was , said: “First I rang my foster mum and then I rang my actual mum. Both of my mums were so excited.“When I was put in care because of family dficulties, all I knew was that statistically care leavers don’t do very well.“But I wanted to prove that it’s not the end of the world and show my foster-sister that you can change the outcome of negative experiences. I was determined that my future would be dferent.”However, she admitted: “I nearly didn’t apply because I was scared of leaving London and figuring out where I’d live during half-term and after I graduated.”He has an offer to study medicine at Selwyn College, Cambridge.Jeffery Maya, , has been offered a place at Pembroke College, Cambridge, to read natural sciences. He said: “You don’t see a lot of people around Newham going to college. A lot of people get into illegal stuff.”So how is Brampton producing such excellence  The school aims to instil a self-belief in its pupils that any Etonian would be proud of.Its director of sixth sorm, economics teacher Sam Dobin, believes the school motto — Success Through Effort And Determination — sums up its mission statement.The -year-old has been offered a place to read English at St Hilda’s College, Oxford.She said: “My first language is Arabic and lots of people outside of school said I couldn’t do it, but my teachers always believed in me.“For me, this offer sets my family on a new path.“In my culture, women are traditionally told not to pursue education. I’m trying to prove that girls can do it too.”He said: “We tell our students, ‘No one has won a race they haven’t started’. We tell them to believe in themselves. It’s about high aspiration.“We have a very traditional approach, no gimmicks or shortcuts.”A Cambridge graduate himself, Sam added: “We say to students, ‘Do not be intimidated. You will meet people who don’t speak the same way or look the same way as you, but they’re no more intelligent and no more worthy than you are’.“We don’t get all our black students into a room and say, ‘This is something you can achieve because you’re oppressed’. We say, ‘You’re good enough’.He has an offer to study medicine at Selwyn College, Cambridge.Victor explained: “This is something that I have wanted my whole le. It’s made my family really proud.“The application process was challenging but being surrounded by other students going through the same thing made it a lot less daunting.”“We think it’s a dangerous message to spread that the only way you’ll succeed is to become more like students from traditional backgrounds.“There is no traditional background for Oxbridge, it’s about your academic talents. We don’t think they should be defined by where you’re from.”As for mixing with students from Eton and other public schools when they get to Oxbridge, Sam said: “Fundamentally there’s no dference.“They might have had dferent le experiences but what binds them when they go to these universities is talent. Oxbridge is becoming increasingly erse.”Blessing came to the UK when she was  and attended a failing secondary school before arriving at Brampton Manor.She said of the offer: “It felt like all my work was worth it. My family were very happy for me and proud of what I have achieved.“Attending Oxford University is something I couldn’t have imagined. I wasn’t sure about applying at first because I didn’t think that I would get in.Support from my school has given me a lot more confidence in myself.”Yet self-belief can only take you so far. Brampton, which chooses its  sixth formers on academic ability, also buys each one their own textbooks to encourage independent study. And it uses cash from the Pupil Premium — the extra Government money given to raise academic results in disadvantaged communities — on funding a study centre.It is open and staffed from am to .pm, with many students working there until it closes.Sam said: “You do get students in at am. You might see  students in the study centre at times.”The school does not rely on supply teachers and has high staffing levels, including five Oxbridge graduates.It’s an academy in Newham, London — one of the country’s poorest areas.Yet  sixth-formers this year alone have got Oxbridge offers. Nearly all are ethnic minority kids, most of them the first in their family ever to go to university.There’s no big secret. Just hard graft, long hours and bright, motivated pupils encouraged to believe anything is possible.Plus tireless and dedicated staff.It’s an incredible success story.Sam added: “We over-staff as a school. In economics we have . more teachers than we need.“That gives you the opportunity to break out and have students work in smaller groups and cover staff absence. But staff absence is very low at the school because teachers want to be here teaching these students.“We believe putting our students with staff who have had the experience themselves is going to help them aspire to achieve.“The students that come to us in the sixth form come here with good GCSE grades and a desire to go to university, and when they’re surrounded by other students who want to do the same thing and teachers who teach them well, that’s how it goes.”Parents are also encouraged to be aspirational for their youngsters.Sam added: “Parents generally want what’s best for their children. We expect parents not to make excuses for their children, to have very high expectations for their students and to support us in the work we’re doing.”No one can doubt the results. Brampton Manor Academy, rated “Outstanding” by Ofsted, only opened its sixth form in .Its first year of Oxbridge applications led to one offer, the following year it was five. Last year it was  and now it has reached .There is an honours board proudly displayed at the school with the names of every pupil who has won a place at Oxford or Cambridge.And it’s not just to Oxbridge — pupils are also gaining places at universities across Britain in remarkable numbers.Sam said: “We’ve got the highest progression rate to university of any school in the country — over  per cent.”Despite Brampton’s success, there is still a long way to go for state school pupils. Just seven per cent of children go to independent schools, but  per cent of Oxbridge places go to privately educated kids.Yet Brampton’s hard-working and aspirational youngsters prove that our state schools are also brimming with often untapped academic talent.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Jacob Rees-Mogg invited leading Tory eurosceptics including Boris Johnson, David Davis and Iain Duncan Smith to a celebration party. Guests were greeted with a champagne flute at the door of the Tory MP’s pound million mansion just minutes from the House of Commons. The other side of Westminster, Theresa May was contemplating her humiliating defeat and steeling herself for another tumultous day ahead. Her strategy for surviving the no confidence vote was to make sure she didn’t take the fizz out of the Brexiteers champagne too early.   Instead, she waited until after the result was announced by her chief whip before inviting Jeremy Corbyn and other party leaders to talks. But before they even made it to the steps of Downing Street she had scuppered any attempts at compromise by ruling out a customs union. It is Labour’s biggest ask - and would infuriate hardline Brexiteers - but is also one of the few plan Bs that could command a majority in Parliament.  Instead - as the clock ticks ever close to crashing out of the EU without a deal - more stalemate beckons. Over the next few days the PM will try to win over the leaders of smaller parties and backbench Labour MPs. But her refusal to even countenance budging on her red lines suggests she is putting the Tory party ahead of the national interest. She has just four days to try to reach agreement. At that point the Government will have to table a fresh motion which - crucially - can be amended by MPs.   Parliament will take control of Brexit with a series of votes on their own alternatives. Pro-EU MPs are expected to demand the Government rules out a no deal, delays Brexit or holds a second referendum. Even though the votes would not be legally binding, it would be politically impossible for the PM to ignore them. With a softer - and delayed - Brexit looking the most likely outcome, perhaps the champagne should have been kept on ice.

For destabilising the government, damaging democracy, ignoring the will of the people, and hurling us all into an unwanted unknown. And no, theyre not Remainers.This drinks party from hell included household names who, were they living in Hackney, would have been given ASBOs by now. Boris Whose We Is It Anyway Johnson, John Be-Knighted Redwood, David I Can Kill With My Bare Hands, You Know Davis and Iain Universal Credit Was A Great Idea, Wasnt It Duncan Smith.These low-rent conmen, who couldnt sell you a used car without slashing the tyres first, wrap themselves in the Union flag and say they are serving our country while their actions undermine and destroy everything we hold dear.Brexit, they tell us, is vital to democracy, freedom, and the right of Parliament to pass its own laws. So they ignore the will of the people in  and demand we adhere to the will they had in  they demand we unshackle our nation from freedom-loving neighbours and tie it instead to the fate of an orange madman and they fulminate that Parliament passing its own laws is now our biggest fear. And while they strut across our national stage saying No Deal is a great idea, and we should rely on World Trade Organisation rules which would put tarfs on things that currently dont have any, terry the City and mean Northern Ireland gets a Trumpian wall built along its entire , they forget the fact the people not only didnt vote for it, but were expressly told by the Leave campaign it would NEVER happen. There are two main dferences between patriotism and nationalism - thought and effect. Patriotism requires you to put your countrys needs before your personal wishes, so the country wins. Nationalism promises that whatever you wish MUST be delivered because of which rocks you stand on. And the effect of nationalism is always failure. It failed in Ireland. It failed in Germany. It failed in France, Italy, Cambodia, China. It failed in Cable Street. Because nationalism wants, creates and fosters stupidity, those countries which fall victim to it always suffer. To be a nationalist, you have to look at the problems around you and decide its someone s fault. Patriots look at the mess and decide to clean it up. Unfortunately, there arent enough patriots to go around at present.  Theresa May leads the first government in history to be held in contempt of Parliament. For two and a half years, she has put the needs of her party above those of her country. She called a snap election to refresh her popular mandate, and lost it. She has never sought genuine cross-party support for the most serious constitutional decision in our letimes. Instead she is an ideologue interested only in serving the % of the country she thinks is the most racist. Jeremy Corbyn holds a chunk of his own party and voters in contempt, and they hold him in the same. Instead of offering a solution for Brexit, he keeps calling for a general election he doesnt want and cannot win. He has ignored the democratic will of his party and MPs on Brexit because it does not chime with his own wishes, and when asked to talk about Brexit he demands, in effect, that Brexit be stopped first. And this even though he doesnt want it stopped and knows that, politically, it cant be. And around these two in Parliament are others who lack love for their country. MPs who voted resoundingly to begin Article  without a plan in place. Who voted for a referendum that was not binding, and which they now insist must be implemented. Who wrote legislation for that referendum so poor that even after we learned electoral law was broken, we were unable to declare it null and start again. The referendum was always advisory, not legally binding. That meant that even though the Electoral Commission found evidence of tampering at the criminal level of being beyond any reasonable doubt, the referendum could stand. Had the thing carried legal weight, the courts would have cancelled it and ordered another. Although the referendum was badly-legislated and badly-worded - the UK leaving the EU was never an option, only the UK dissolving itself and THEN leaving - no-one working at the heart of our democracy had the wit to write it properly, or the patriotism to put our need for a democratically-reliable vote above their political whim.Because without a legal need to do so, the only reason to enforce the referendum result is political. It depends on the mood of the country. And the mood of the country is a long way from criminals in hi-vis jackets poncing around Parliament Green on a livestream. The country is tired of this. It wants normal and calm and for Parliament to find the time and inclination to fold social care into the NHS, relieve the never-ending winter crisis, fund schools properly, fix the potholes and empty the bins. The nation wants Universal Credit to be fixed, HS to be scrapped and Northern Ireland not to get too excited. But this gravity well at the heart of Westminster is sucking the patriotism, the common sense, and the long-sightedness out of our Parliamentarians. Instead too many of them are manoeuvring for Mays job, while not wanting to do it. Labour is fighting itself, the Lib Dems are barely inhaling and the DUP is giddily running the show despite the fact it is in charge of Northern Ireland only by dint of .% of the vote and couldnt run a tap without screaming. However you voted, you know this: this is not our country at its finest.  The nationalists at Jacob Rees-Moggs soiree have ensured that Theresa May is their leader for another year, but that her plan for Brexit has failed. Parliamentarians have ignored the national will for an orderly Brexit, and the PM has ignored the need for compromise while the unionists of the DUP have done more to dissolve the union than the equivalent amount of hydrochloric acid. And meanwhile, here are we: blaming David Cameron for the mess we voted for him to get us into, arguing over what a badly-written and illegal vote meant, fretting about things which a large chunk of us refuse even to try to understand, and telling pollsters well go for No Deal Because Thats What We Voted For even though a quick look proves that we didnt. If we push on with Brexit, itll be delayed or disastrous. That doesnt suit anyone, Leave, Remain, nationalist or patriot. The costs will be immediate, the trade talks will last for years, and the blame will be apportioned for a century. No-one, but no-one, will win.

The four-year-old pupil wandered out of Forest Lodge Academy, in Leicester, under the noses of teachers and support staff. One driver said she had to slam the brakes to avoid running him down on a busy main road. The incident took place at the end of the school day at around pm yesterday. The boys dad, who wants to remain anonymous, said he felt “physically sick” that it was allowed to happen. Now he is demanding answers from the school. He told Leicestershire Live: “It was at the end of the school day and when parents and s were collecting the children.   “Somehow my son, who is only four, managed to walk out of the school past teachers and school staff. “He wandered out of the door and out of the school gates. “He’d managed to cross one road and was trying to cross Charnor Road, which is very busy at that time of day, when a woman picking up her child spotted him. “She had to slam on her brakes to avoid hitting him and got out and grabbed him. “It wasn’t until that point that anyone realised he was gone.” The boy had been waiting along with other pupils to be collected from school when he went walkabout. His father said: “His aunt was picking him from school. She had parked nearby and was walking through a jitty when she saw a commotion in the road ahead of her. “All the cars had stopped and there was a crowd gathered around. “It wasn’t until she got closer that she realised it was my son who was involved.   “He was unhurt but it could’ve been so much worse. “The driver said she felt sick – I feel sick too that this was allowed to happen. It’s disgraceful.” He added: “I was at work when my ex-partner rang me about  minutes later to tell me what happened. “I wasn’t very happy about it at all. “I rang the school and was told a member of the school staff had been standing at a door reading a roll call. “When a parent arrives to pick up their child then their name is called out. “They said no-one had called out my son’s name so they assumed he was still there.” The school has since issued an apology to the boy’s parents and held a meeting with his mother. His father said: “I want answers. I don’t know how he simply walked out.   “He could have been run over or abducted. And we’d have had no idea. It’s only luck that prevented it from turning out very dferently.” He added: “I want assurances that it will not happen again. “When you send your child to school you expect every precaution to be taken to make sure they are safe.” A statement issued by the school said it was making “enforced, proactive improvements” to increase security and prevent any repeat of the incident. Headteacher Claire Caldwell said: “An incident took place after school on Thursday that was resolved quickly and effectively - of which we immediately informed the mother of the child. “Following this, and in line with good practice, we informed all necessary authorities and a full staff briefing was held where a thorough risk assessment and review of the relevant policies was completed. “We have already made and enforced proactive improvements and processes moving forwards.” She added: “A full face to face meeting was held this morningwith the mother where all of this was comprehensively outlined and acknowledged. “As always, the safety of our whole school community is of paramount importance to us.”"},{"url":null,"title":"boy 4 who couldnt swim","story":"NewsBoy, , who couldnt swim found floating after dad left him alone at water parkThe boy was found floating under the water by a female swimmer in the adult pool in Burnham on Crouch, SomersetShareByMartyn HalleAbigail OLeary:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe horric incident occurred at Brean Leisure Park in Burnham on Crouch, Somerset\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old boy almost drowned after his father left him alone in a toddler pool to go on a water slide. The father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was slammed by a judge for leaving his son alone for a momentary frolic. The boy was left alone in a special toddler part of the pool at Brean Leisure Park in Burnham on Crouch, Somerset, before he made his way into the adult pool. He was found floating under the water by a female swimmer who felt her foot brush against something on the bottom. The father had taken the boy swimming after an argument with his former partner and forgot to take his sons armbands. He was charged with causing unnecessary suffering of a child under  following the incident in August . Emma Martin, prosecuting at Taunton Crown Court, said: This was a tragic case of a momentary error of judgement on the defendants part.He didnt take arm bands with him knowing full well that his son couldnt swim.   He went with his son to the small toddler area. The defendant decided to go on the flume himself leaving his son to play in the toddler area. By the time he came back his son wasnt where he left him. The court heard the mans son, who was just four and a half at the time of the incident, had climbed out of the small toddler area and gone into the adult pool. Mrs Harding, a swimmer who was in the adult pool at the time of the incident, said she felt her foot brush something during her swim and was shocked when she saw the body of a child floating under the water. Mrs Martin said Mrs Harding pulled the boy to safety and put him on the side of the pool but leguards and swimmers were shocked and didnt know what to do so the boy lay motionless on the side of the pool for a few minutes. The court heard off duty paramedic Emma Aims then ran over to the scene and started to resuscitate the boy and luckily he regained consciousness after coughing up a large amount of water. The boy was taken to Bristol Childrens Hospital for treatment and stayed in their high dependency unit for two days.   The court heard when the father called his former partner to tell her what had happened he lied he had just popped to the toilet when the incident happened and also lied when interviewed by police. Mrs Martin said the man later called the police and admitted he had left the child unattended and said the son has made a full recovery.Defending, Charlotte Pitts said the defendant and his former partner broke up shortly after the incident but said he managed to rebuild the relationship with his son and sees him on a regular basis. Ms Pitts said the man is deeply remorseful for his actions and said references describe him as a great father and friend. Sentencing, Judge David Ticehurst, said: This must have been any parents nightmare. What was wrong as you may realise was to leave your son for a momentary frolic and forget about him.  If you had just turned awaynone of this would have happened, your son wouldnt have had to spent two days in hospital. I have no doubt that you feel remorse after this incident. Any parent could go and do something with their children and think,only I had taken things a bit more carefully. Dont you dare leave him alone again. Judge Ticehurst sentenced the man to an  month conditional discharge and ordered that pound of public money be given to Mrs Harding and Emma Aims to recognise the efforts they made in rescuing the boy. He was also ordered to pay pound in costs including pound to the two ladies who saved his sons le.

The new charge is aimed at freeing up roads in some of the UKs busiest cities.A workplace parking levy is being considered by at least ten councils in England and Scotland to reduce traffic and pollution and to raise money for public transport, according to The Times.The charge would be imposed on businesses with more than ten parking spaces and is designed to push employees out of their cars. The AA told the newspaper that the plans were a “poll tax on wheels” and that costs would be passed onto workers.   In Nottingham, the only city to introduce the levy so far, about four in ten companies pass costs on to staff, it has been reported. Hundreds of teachers pay to park cars in the city but NHS buildings are exempt. The charge has raised pound.million since it was introduced in , with much of that money being spent on improving the citys tram network. However critics have claimed there is little evidence that the levy had in fact cut car journeys and have warned they could lead to job losses.   Robert Halfon, Conservative chairman of the Commons education select committee, told The Times: “This is complete madness. It’s yet another tax on motorists and all it will do is hit working people with the cost of living. It’s entirely the wrong thing to do.” Hounslow in west London is proposing to charge between pound and pound, a year per parking space.  A consultation closed on Friday and the plans will be examined by the council’s cabinet. At least nine other councils are pushing for the levy, according to The Times. Edinburgh and Glasgow councils have declared their intention to introduce a charge.Reading, Oxford, Bristol land Cambridge and the London boroughs of Merton, Brent and Camden are consulting on introducing them."},{"url":null,"title":"dancing ice didi conn cried","story":"NewsDancing on Ice Didi Conn cried when autistic son first said I love you age EXCLUSIVE: Grease star Didi, , took years out of her career to give round-the clock care to Danny, who was diagnosed aged three and cannot be left aloneShareCommentsByJulie McCaffrey:,  JAN NewsDidi with husband David and Danny\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHearing her son say “I love you” for the first time made Dancing on Ice star Didi Conn cry tears of joy. That’s because the shyemotional moment came only weeks ago – and her son Danny is  years old. For a young man with autism, who struggles to understand abstract ideas and emotions, it was a major breakthrough. Didi says: “The first time Danny said, ‘I love you’ was this year. I was leaving to fly to the UK and he said it on the phone. I kept saying, ‘say it again, baby’. And he did. “Then he said, ‘why are you crying ’. So I told him they were happy tears. And oh my God, did I cry  It was the biggest milestone, it really was. Because I couldn’t really hold him as a baby, as he was so sensitive and didn’t like to be held, so that was tricky. It really was something special to hear.” Grease star Didi, , took years out of her career to give round-the clock care to Danny, who was diagnosed aged three and has extreme sensitivity to sound and cannot be left alone. She agreed to leave her New York home for her new Dancing on Ice role only after he settled happily into le on a self-sustaining farm and school supported by -hour carers. The move springboards her to the second chapter of her career. And although younger contestants are scoring higher marks, thoughts of her son help boost her confidence.  Didi says: “When I saw a film of my first dress rehearsal on the ice, I was upset because I didn’t look good and everybody  seemed to be much better skaters. “I was feeling stressed so I meditated and what came to my mind was how accepting we are of Daniel and his limitations. You go into another time zone when you are a parent of an autistic child, where any micro movement in a positive direction is such a cause for celebration. “That’s a gt, because children can grow so quickly and we don’t see every incremental change. “Then I have to give myself a break, put things in perspective and realise I am doing more than I did two months ago. I didn’t fall down.” Didi, who has been married to composer David Shire for  years, will for ever be remembered as Frenchy in Grease, the biggest musical film of the th century. She played a teenage beauty-school dropout, but in reality she was  and ending her first marriage to Frankie Conn when the film was released in .   Didi performed her first Dancing on Ice routine in her original Pink Ladies jacket, which she only realised was valuable after hearing about the one belonging to co-star Dinah Manoff, who played Marty Maraschino in the film. “TV producers told me they once had to insure Marty’s jacket for pound,. Mine’s just been on a hanger next to all my ordinary clothes all these years.”Judge Jason Gardiner was witheringly unimpressed with her routine to film track We Come Together and accused her of “dining out on that song for years”. Didi says: “I wasn’t hurt by Jason’s comments because he’s a nice guy. But my husband got a copy of the episode and showed it to my three brothers. They were upset by his words, so that upset me. “Actually, my brothers might fly over and have a bit of a word with Jason.”  Didi’s Grease co-star John Travolta might also be pretty mfed with Jason. Ever since starring in the global hit, the pair have remained firm friends.Didi’s bond with Travolta, , grew even stronger when his son Jett, who died in , aged , after suffering a seizure, was diagnosed with autism. “His son Jett was six months older than Daniel and he was diagnosed with autism, but they didn’t want to call it that when he was alive. “After he passed away they said yes, it was autism. He was so concerned and I would talk with his we about it. “I know they invested millions of dollars into dferent research because Jett did not speak. Anything I ever heard about new findings, whether it was diet or anything, they would follow up.”  Didi says she is in touch with everyone from Grease, including Barry Pearl, but not Stockard Channing, and is very close to Olivia Newton-John, . She was stunned when news spread that the star, who has breast cancer, is close to death. Didi says: “That was a terrible shock. Someone told me they’d just heard this awful rumour. But I’d just talked to her two days before and she sounded fine. “Then they showed me the video of her saying she was well and she looked beautul. So I called her right afterwards and she said, ‘you know how these rumours start’. She’s very well.” For now, Didi is looking ahead to tomorrow’s show when she and her professional skating partner Lukasz Rozycki will perform to the Mary Poppins song Spoonful of Sugar.  She says: “My shoulders keep coming up when I skate, but that’s a lot to do with being  and you start to get a hump. “But Mary Poppins is so elegant she would never have her shoulders up. So it’s a great challenge...” Look closely at Didi’s costume and you might see the outline of a secret gadget she created to help her through rehearsals. “I made an invention,” she says. “One place I don’t have a lot of padding is my ribs. A little further down’s fine. I’m learning new lts and my ribs were very sore. “So I got knee pads, brought them to the wardrobe department and they extended the elastic so they go around my waist and protect my ribs.  “And they really help – just don’t tell anybody.” This series of Dancing on Ice, hosted by Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, has been rocked with controversy after Holly accused contestant Gemma Collins of being unprofessional for holding up filming by leaving early because she was bored. Didi is diplomatic. “If Gemma held up filming, I wasn’t there. If someone had that experience, it wasn’t me. “Gemma was up on the balcony cheering me when I did my first skate – and that helped me so much. “Every time I pass her, she’s doing something on her phone and she says, ‘oh, there’s my Didi’. She’s always so loving. “She’s a beautul, golden Mae West. She’s so sexy and funny and really knows how to hold an audience, which is a beautul thing to see. She sparkles.”  For Grease-lovers, there is only one legend on the show and it’s Didi. For  years, fans across the world have adored her portrayal of Pink Lady Frenchy and it’s clear Didi also has huge affection for the character.Didi is touched by the outpouring of love for her on Twitter , but says there are some drawbacks to being so well remembered.“My voice triggers people into recognising me, often at the weirdest times. If I’m in the theatre and talking while in line to go to the loo, the rest of the queue will turn around and say, ‘wait a minute, it’s you’. “Then they try to talk to me when I’m about to go into the stall. And that’s not a good place to talk.” "},{"url":null,"title":"healthy mum seven 34 suddenly","story":"NewsHealthy mum-of-seven, , suddenly drops dead from silent killer in her homeLoyal and loving Jacqueline Totty, of Wirral, Merseyside, died after suffering from a rare heart disease she was not even aware she hadShareCommentsByRachael McMenemy:,  JAN NewsJacqueline Ann Totty, , died from a rare form of heart disease \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum-of-seven who appeared to be perfectly healthy dropped dead at her home from a silent killer.

Liverpool Echo reports that despite being rushed to Arrowe Park Hospital all attempts to resuscitate her failed. Jacqueline died on September , , Liverpool Coroners Court was told. In a tribute posted on a Just Giving page the mum was described as a loyal, loving partner shortly after her death. Pathologist, Dr Christopher Johnson, warned her family of the dangers of the rare inherited heart disease, that killed her during an inquest into her death. Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy is known to cause sudden death, especially in younger people.   Dr Johnson also told the court toxicology results showed Miss Totty had a small amount of cocaine in her system. However he did not believe this to be a signicant factor in her death. He said: I felt these changes [to her heart] were more extensive that just previous cocaine use.I asked for a specialist opinion to have this reviewed with particular concern about her age and something going on with her heart. However, he said he could not discard the cocaine entirely, telling the court:Both can cause abnormalities , together its not a good combination.

She added: She died of the natural disease Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathyin conjunction with cocaine.In its own right it can cause sudden death, more than likely a combination of both has increased the risk of fatality.

Roy Warne, , was a witness to the crash and first on the scene. Asked what the Duke first said when he was freed, he replied: I cant remember, but it was nothing rude. He was obviously shaken, and then he went and askedeveryone  was all right. Barrister Roy added the Dukes first words to him while he lay trapped were: My legs, where should I put my legs . He described seeing the Land Rover roll across the A like a somersault, adding it was turning on its side over and over, reports The Sun. Roy, who was travelling with his we Victoria at the time, stopped his car and rushed to help, eventually pulling the Duke from his seat after smashing through the windscreen and sunroof.   He revealed how Prince Philip said the Duke went on to ask where to , when Roy told him to move one of his legs to free the other. After placing his hands under his armpits and gently pulling him from the smashed car, Roy said Prince Philip stood up, unharmed - with his first thoughts for others involved in the smash. He added: The roof was where the window should have been, because it was on its side. I think I helped him out through either the sunroof or the front windscreen, but Im a bit blurred about that. He was disorientated and humbled. I believe he was very sorry about what had happened. He was very shaken and then he went and askedeveryone  was alright. Roy revealed how he first attended the passengers and baby in the blue Kia, saying how he thought it was going to burst into flames when he saw smoke rising from it.   He said he could hear a baby screaming in the back of the car and that his mother was understandably hysterical. Roy told Radio  Today: The person in the car behind me also stopped and a passenger from that car actually took the baby in his arms after we had freed it from the baby harness. One of them had a broken arm. They were very shaken. One of them was the mother of the child and she was quite upset. I think theres no doubt that it was hit . Thats my recollection. I didnt see it come from the side road, I saw it careering and tumbling across the road and ending up on the other side. It would take a massive force and it had rolled on the other side as well. Roy also told the Sun how the Duke, who escaped without serious injury, had been dazzled by the sun.  The glare of the low-lying sun can be a particular problem for drivers at certain times of year. According to the AA, being dazzled by bright light is frequently cited as the cause of road accidents. Figures released in  showed the glare of a low-lying sun was contributing to an average of  road deaths a year. Two women required hospital treatment after the crash, with one suspected of suffering a broken arm. The full statement from Buckingham Palace, released yesterday, reads: The Duke of Edinburgh was involved in a road traffic accident with another vehicle this afternoon. The Duke was not injured. The accident took place close to the Sandringham Estate.   A police spokesman said: “We were called to the scene at around pm to reports of a two vehicle collision. The road is not blocked. Recovery has been called and we are at the scene waiting for them to arrive.” Norfolk Police is investigating the incident and a full investigation is taking place, it is understood.

Showcasing incredible control of the jet pack, the green beret manages to land on top of a wall before zooming off again. With Tanner remarking “You don’t see this every day”, the stunt came as part of a test-flight performed by British technology start-up company, Gravity Industries.   Created by former marine-turned-inventor Richard Browning, the jet suit is made up of five small kerosene-fueled turbine engines - with two worn on each arm and one of the pilot’s back - generating an eye-watering , horsepower.   The suit, nicknamed “Daedalus” after the mythological Greek artist who made wings of feathers and wax, can fly for up to four minutes at a time and can propel the operator up to , feet in the air.

Although not part of an official mission, it showed off the skill and heroism that has made the regiment admired by armies around the world. But most of its exploits will never be told as it prides itself on secrecy. The soldier, in Kenya training the country’s own special forces, was said to be out shopping when al-Shabaab fighters targeted a hotel. He sprinted back to his car to kit-up and then waded in, storming the luxury Dusit complex in Nairobi single-shyhandedly to tackle terrorist gunmen and leading terried hostages to safety.   The astonishing images rank alongside the famous footage of the regiment taking the Iranian Embassy in West London in , where  hostages were being held. Here, SAS legend Chris Ryan, who spent  years in the regiment and walked  miles to the Syrian border in the Gulf War to escape Iraqi forces, tells of a few of its finest hours… Afghanistan, January   When a Taliban commander escaped a joint British and Afghan special forces raid and disappeared into a narrow mountain tunnel, an SAS soldier volunteered to go in after him alone. Afghan soldiers had refused to enter the terrorist-riddled cave complex, where tunnels were barely big enough for a man to fit inside. So the SAS sergeant crawled into the dark tunnel system to locate the enemy fighter. The unnamed -year-old, from the Midlands, eventually found three Taliban soldiers inside the narrow caves and shot them dead with his Glock sidearm. When he saw another, he pointed it towards him but the gun failed. Without enough room for a long-barrelled weapon, he picked up a claw hammer and hit the Taliban soldier over the head. A source said: “He fought two more in the dark where the tunnel opened into a larger room which was partially lit by a candle. “After he killed those two, he was attacked by another but killed him almost instantly with a single blow. It was a brutal fight to the death. “The SAS sergeant emerged from the tunnel half an hour later covered in blood, both his own and those of the men he had killed.” He later said that the minutes he spent inside the caves had been the hardest of his military career. Chris says: “It was an incredible act of bravery, going in to one of the tunnel systems by himself, the claustrophobia, and lack of air – the thought of it is absolutely terrying. “The soldier was so traumatised he was unable to speak for a time after coming out. But his bravery is not extraordinary among SAS soldiers, it’s just what they do.” Lufthansa Flight , October ,   When terrorists hijacked Lufthansa Flight   minutes into its flight from Palma de Mallorca to Frankfurt, German chancellor Helmut Schmidt asked for help from our special forces. SAS veterans Sgt Maj Barry Davies and Maj Alastair Morrison were summoned to Downing Street, where they set about devising a plan to rescue the hostages –  passengers, including  German beauty queens, and five crew. Davies told ministers, as well as German anti-terror unit GSG, an assault using recently developed stun grenades offered the best chance. Over the next few days, they trailed the Boeing  as the four Palestinian terrorists, demanding the release of prisoners in Germany and Turkey, made the pilots fly to airports in Rome, Cyprus, Bahrain, Dubai, Aden, and Mogadishu in Somalia.In Dubai, the SAS and GSG operatives were on the point of making an assault when it took off and flew to Aden – where pilot Jurgen Schumann was shot dead. The co-pilot flew the plane to Mogadishu, where Schumann’s body was dumped on the tarmac and an ultimatum issued for the release of the prisoners. There, Davies and Morrison’s daring plan was put into action. Shortly before midnight, Somali soldiers lit a large bonfire on the runway to create a ersion and draw the hijackers into the cockpit, as the assault team approached the rear. As the emergency doors were blown in, the SAS men hurled stun grenades as German soldiers stormed in, telling hostages to lie down and opening fire. Three terrorists were killed, including the leader, who died before he could detonate the grenades rigged up around the plane. Only four hostages and one German soldier were wounded. Chris says at first, no one knew of the role of the SAS. “Whenever anything happened they were who governments would call first. But often no one found out the SAS were behind them. Even during the Waco siege in the US we had two advisors there. The way the Lufthansa hijacking was carried out follows the textbook to the letter, I’ve taken part in training on planes using exactly the same tactics.” Davies, who died in , was later awarded the British Empire Medal and Morrison the OBE. Malayan Emergency -  Disbanded after the end of the Second World War, the SAS was reformed after communist fighters started a guerrilla war against colonial British rule in Malaya, southeast Asia. The CTs – or communist terrorists – set up bases in the thick jungle and from there attacked police stations, rubber plantations and tin mines. As the brutal attacks escalated, three SAS squadrons – first called the Malayan Scouts – were formed, tasked with taking the fight to the insurgents by operating as guerrillas themselves. Commanded by Maj Mike Calvert, small SAS patrols of  men disappeared deep into the remote jungles for up to three months at a time, in appalling conditions, and soon became skilled in jungle warfare.  One of the tactics of the SAS men was to befriend the jungle tribes who often supplied the terrorists with food, using their medical skills to treat their diseases and even learning to speak their tribal language, Sakai. This way, they were able to cut off the CTs’ supply sources, forcing them to retreat further into the swamps and jungles, where they were hunted down and either killed or captured. Chris Ryan says the Malaya jungle experience served as the basis for SAS tactics to this day. He adds: “Every tactic the SAS usestoday originates in jungle and isthe most important part of soldiers’training. “If you can soldier in the jungle, you can soldier anywhere.” Pebble Island May  to ,   As British troops headed to recapture the Falkland Islands in May , an advance reconnaissance team of SAS troops discovered an Argentine airstrip on Pebble Island. It was feared the Pucara and T- Turbo-Mentor planes stationed there might attack the main British force when it landed at San Carlos. Due to the presence of civilians nearby, an air strike was deemed unsuitable – so a daring SAS mission was quickly planned instead. On the night of May ,  SAS operatives were dropped by helicopter five miles from their target, then marched towards the airstrip. While the destroyer HMS Glamorgan began raining shells on the barracks, two seven-man SAS assault teams made their way to the aircraft, placing the explosive charges on their fuselages. They then retreated and set off the charges, destroying all  planes in a series of explosions. The smouldering wrecks were then raked with machine gun fire and anti-tank rockets to prevent the enemy repairing them or reusing any parts. Fuel spilling on to the airfield then caught fire and the enormous blaze, along with the continued shell and tracer rounds, lit up the night sky. The only SAS casualties were two men lightly injured by a landmine. Chris says: “This raid was classic SAS, just like the regiment’s famous missions blowing up German airfields in Africa during the Second World War. “It’s the kind of mission that makes the SAS feared by any army.” Tragically, just days later, many of the Pebble Island heroes lost their lives in a freak accident considered the biggest SAS catastrophe since the Second World War, when a Sea King helicopter with  people on board crashed after a large sea bird was sucked into its engine. Twenty servicemen were killed,  of them SAS, and most of whom had taken part in the Pebble Island raid.

But the ex-RAF fighter pilot opened his eyes and, though barely coherent, was able to respond to questions.

He told the court: “I remember he [Hill] had quite a lot of blood around his face.” The pilot had symptoms consistent with a head injury and his medical condition was deteriorating rapidly, he added.

Mr Kemp told the court Hill was sedated with mg of ketamine and rushed to hospital. Without immediate treatment, he would have died at the scene. The Red Cross nurse told the jury he had to climb through undergrowth to get to the wreckage and could see “a lot of debris” as the blaze from the aircraft raged on August , . Firefighters ran out of water and were soon unable to tackle the flames, the jury was told.  Thomas Maloney, the former owner of the doomed Hawker Hunter fighter jet, earlier told the court how he watched the tragedy in horror. Mr Maloney, a pilot for about  years, said: “At the time I was quite shocked as the air speed was quite slow.”  Mr Maloney, who bought the jet from the Ministry of Defence in , told the court he had a “sickening feeling” and turned to his friend, also a pilot, and, referring to Hill, said: “Well, he’s dead then.” The plane failed to complete a loop and crashed into a “huge fireball” on the A, engulfing spectators and motorists.

In his  book ‘Duke of Edinburgh: A portrait by his valet’, John Dean reveal that shortly after the Elizabeth II and Philip got engaged in , the future prince was involved in a nasty collision. Skidding off the road in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, Philip - who according to Dean was renown for his speed - struck a tree, before crashing through a fence. Then , Prince Philip escaped relatively unscathed, suffering a few bruises and a twisted knee. He was rescued by a passing driver after midnight, who spotted him standing next to the wreckage.   The accident added further public scrutiny on young Philip’s behaviour during a bout of constant publicity after his proposal to the future Queen of England. The Duke of Edinburgh was advised to surrender his license indefinitely, according to Dean. “After the engagement was announced, his private le became so much a public affair that it was even suggested he should give up driving,” Dean recalled. The former valet described Philip’s driving style as “fast but safe” in his experience at the side of the duke.   “He is a very good driver,” Dean said in . The passage also cites a newspaper article from the time, which highlights the Prince’s penchant for speed. It reads: A keen mechanic and motorist, he has a zest for speed which has even upset even the Royal chauffeurs, men with accident-free records who are now chary of driving with him. Philip’s naval friends credit him with their camp record for the ninety-eight-mile journey from Corsham to London one hour forty minutes.  On Thursday, Prince Phillip collided with a blue Kia carrying a -month-old child on board near the Queen’s Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. A passing driver, -year-old Victoria Warne - whose husband helped hoist the -year-old from the wreckage - says Philip asked “Is everyone alright ” Before adding, “I’m such a fool.”  The Duke was treated in hospital on Friday morning, but is understood to have been “worrying about the others [involved in the crash]” Mr Warne said: I saw the car flip and thought f*****g hell. Before I even stopped I said to Victoria, dial . I looked down and had the Prince’s blood on my hands. All I could think is, thank goodness there wasn’t more, the pensioner told The Sun. I had his blood on my hands. It wasn’t much and one of the royal people gave me a wipe.”  The smash injured a grandmother and mum but the baby travelling in the Kia was unharmed. The duke retired from royal duties in August  and underwent a hip replacement in May last year, having completed some , solo engagements since .

Darran Evesham, , Ieuan Harley,  and David Osbourne, are jointly accused of murdering David Gaut, , after discovering he brutally killed a -month-old baby in . They are alleged to have lured Gaut - who also went by the name Dai - to Osbournes flat in New Tredegar, South Wales, before stabbing him  times and cutting off his finger nails, jurors were told. Newport Crown Court heard a message was sent to Osbourne from witness Kyle Alford, saying: Don’t let Dai know we all know he’s a baby killer. Catch the f***ing nonce out,” reports Wales Online. Mr Alford, Osbournes neighbour, told the court how he wanted nothing to do with setting Gaut up so left the premises before the killing.  Mr Alford also told the court Gaut told people in the community he had been to prison for murdering a solider. In fact, Gaut had served  years in prison for the murdering his girlfriends son, Chi Ming Shek, while babysitting. The babys mum Jane Pickthall, then , had been out drinking and left Gaut to look after her two young children before he battered, kicked and burned the youngster. She arrived home in Caerphilly, South Wales, and made love to Gaut - but the next day she found her sons dead body under a chest of drawers. The court heard how Mr Alford discovered Gaut was convicted for a childs murder, not a soldiers, after searching for his name on Google . He told the jury he felt shocked, disgusted and angry at the discovery and then told his neighbour, Osbourne. Mr Alford said: Osbourne was fuming. Angry. Very angry. Just about wanting to beat him up really. Ozzy made a comment, want to cut him up and chuck him down the plughole or something.  Fellow neighbour Ieuan Harley then became angry at the news - calling Gaut a dirty f***er before allegedly planning his murder. Osbourne is alleged to have lured Gaut to his flat by asking him round to the flat to watch a DVD. There, Osbourne, , Harley, , and Darran Evesham, , are alleged to have stabbed Gaut to death before dragging his dead body back next door and trying to clean up the crime scene. Ben Douglas-Jones, prosecuting, said pathologist Dr Derrick James carried out a post-mortem exam and found at least  stab wounds all over Gauts body from at least one kne and a screwdriver. The prosecutor said: A screwdriver was found in the folds of his dressing gown. The injuries to his neck appear to have been consistent with the screwdriver found in the folds of the dressing gown.  “Many of the stab wounds are consistent with having been made with knives. “Dr James found it may be that a larger blade was used to cause the wounds in the belly. “He had been clearly stabbed many times until he was dead. Even then, he continued to receive stabbing blows. “All three wanted him dead. They encouraged each other and played their parts in the lead-up to the murder.” “Mr James found his finger nails had been cut off after he died. Evesham, Osbourne and Harley, all of New Tredegar, Gwent, deny murder. The trial at Newport Crown Court is expected to last four weeks.

Festival goers were promised luxury accommodation, gourmet food and the ultime music line-up including Blink , Migos and Major Lazer. But the reality was very dferent.   Instead of luxury, guests were forced to sleep on rain-soaked mattresses, the gourmet food was in fact sandwiches made from cheese slices and luggage was hurled into an unlit car park. Since the debacle in , organiser Billy McFarland has been sentenced to six years in prison for multiple counts of fraud.A new Netflix documentary, Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened, released today, lists the lid on what really happened.Billed as the ultimate millennial experience, people battling for tickets were promised they would be rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous.  But in reality, those who managed to bag a ticket for the hottest party in town said most people were as ordinary as they were. And it wasnt just festival goers who lost out - people on the island had pulled out all the stops to make sure it was a success. But with the whole thing being put together in just six to eight weeks, the signs it wasnt going to be success it promised were there from the start. And when party goers started to descend on the island, the whole thing fell into chaos.  After being promised a private jet and luxury limos to take them to the venue, people were in fcat transported to the island on a charter flight and picked up at the airport by bus. And when they arrived it was described as like something out of The Hunger Games.Seth, who writes on Twitter as William Needham Finley IV, said: Fyre Fest is a complete disaster. No organisation. No one knows where to go.There are no villas, just a disaster tent city. Furniture bought to transform the tents into a luxury experience turned out to be flatpack and was lying around the site, waiting to be built. Luggage dumped in the car park couldnt be reunited with owners and even the bars and the food stalls hadnt been set up. It has been reported people started looting the boxes of food and drink - and then even the piles of luggage. But then things got even worse. Organisers sent an email saying the festival was cancelled and everyone would have to be flown off the island. Seth told the BBC: Theres so much more to the story than rich kids of Instagram meets Lord of the Flies.Workers on the island also werent paid for the time. And the island locals also massively lost out with one restaurant owner stumping up pound, of her le savings to cater for the festival. Chris Smith, who directed the Netflix documentary, told the BBC: She put up her savings to try and live up to the obligations she had made to them. In the end, when things fell apart and everyone just left, she was left having to deal with this.  Prosecutors called McFarland the consummate con artist in a sentencing memorandum according to the NYC Times. He betrayed and deceived his investors, customers, and employees while he was living the high le at his luxury apartment, traveling to exclusive locales, staying at luxury hotels, being chauffeured in his Maserati, and entertaining himself and his friends at restaurants, bars, and casinos, they added. McFarland begged U.S. District Court Judge Naomi Buchwald for leniency and said Im sorry several times during his sentencing hearing. He claimed he had faced violence in prison and said: The best way to be sorry is through my future actions.

But help would come from a very unlikely source for the Gibbon family - a group of lorry drivers to be precise.  The drivers, who were also desperate to clear the roads to make deliveries, began clearing away huge blocks of ice, like giant snow plows. Talking about the surreal experience, Gibbon said: I was shocked because we had to leave [where we were staying] and as you could see it was an impossible mission. [My two] kids, on the other hand, were laughing and enjoying the snow. Since the snow was huge, we had to exit from behind where people who work at that [truck] depot or whatever it is were cleaning snow and they cleared a path for us.When we got out we had to wait for the road to be cleared fully so we waited there for two hours. Mr Gibbons footage shows the lorries shuffling through the thick snow, leaving a rectangular impression just deep enough to allow vehicles in and out.  Press in Austria have reported that the extreme weather conditions have affected both locals and tourists, with up to , people left cut off from the outside world. Snowstorms have covered parts of central Europe over the last week, andthe forecast is correct Britain could be also in for a big freeze in the coming days.

We can’t know exactly where but we know she is always looking over her shoulder for a Real IRA assassin. Her husband David was a senior member of the Republican group, while a double agent for the FBI and MI, with Maureen undercover, too. So trusted was the American – nicknamed the Big Yank for his ft in, -stone build – that he was appointed to the terrorists’ elite Army Council.He was not only let in on a plot to assassinate then prime minister Tony Blair but even charged with acquiring the weaponry to carry out the attack.When he gave evidence against the Real IRA’s chief of staff, blamed for the horric  Omagh bombing, it led to Michael McKevitt being jailed.   Maureen says: “When it went to court, it blew our lives up. I don’t know how he did it or how I did it. But I believe we saved so many lives. “We got Michael McKevitt and I am very, very proud of David for that.” The US couple’s story is told for the first time by Irish journalist Sean O’Driscoll in The Accidental Spy. Maureen met trucking firm boss David in August , when he rented an office at the truck stop she ran. David was a regular visitor to Ireland and was friends with many IRA sympathisers, having been introduced to the community by an ex who raised funds in the US for the terror group. That summer, David took Maureen with him for the first time. She recalls walking into a pub in Donegal where the walls were covered in IRA posters. “It was all threatening stuff,” she says. “And women were coming in with prams and dancing around singing all these IRA rebel ballads. I thought, ‘Jesus, what is this ’”   David’s regular transatlantic trips did not go unnoticed. He had already been approached by the FBI to work for them. The night they ed to Chicago he told Maureen they had now offered to pay him to be an undercover agent. At that point the former wrestler agreed only to milk the FBI. David says: “I thought, ‘Hey,I can sucker the FBI into paying for our trips, great.’ We both loved Ireland. I didn’t know anything anyway.” It wasn’t long before the MI also wanted him on their books.  Maureen, who became David’s fourth we in November , says: “At the time I thought it was all very James Bond. After  years as a woman in the trucking business, nothing scared me. It was exciting andthe FBI pay for us, great. “Looking back, I had no idea how deep into this thing we would go.” As the peace process progressed, before culminating in the Good Friday Agreement in April , terrorists on both sides gave up their weapons. But the Real IRA splinter group refused. These were the people Maureen and David had befriended. “These people would kill us in a secondthey knew the truth,” Maureen says. “One day I said to David, ‘I can’t wait until we have a normal le’. And he says, ‘You know it will never be a normal le’.” They had a system where immediately after David met with terrorists, he would recite to her what occurred and she’d write it down. Maureen says: “I would give David the notes, then he’d email encrypted details of the meetings to MI and the FBI.” They then burned the notes in the sink. They became so trusted by the IRA that they were invited to dinners with McKevitt and his we Bernadette Sands-McKevitt – sister of Republican Bobby Sands, who died on hunger strike in Maze jail, Co Down, in .  The Ruperts’ double le was thrilling at times but having to lie to their families was exhausting. Maureen says: “It was draining, we lived in a dferent world. My dad, who would’ve been in his s, two brothers and a sister all thought David was in the IRA running guns.” And they came close to being found out. After meeting with an FBI agent in Ireland, David discovered the man had left his business card. Had it been found by the IRA, David would have been killed. He said: “I knew the FBI had this rule: never flush anything down a toilet unless you flush it three times because it can float back up again. So I took the card and ate it.” To prove his loyalty, David smuggled cash into Ireland from Republican sympathisers in the US. He became known as “the man with the bag of money from Chicago” after offering to help Chicago’s Irish Freedom Committee, who funded arms for the IRA. David was later appointed to the Real IRA’s Army Council, rubbing shoulders with bombers.McKevitt would discuss with himhow he wanted to secure sophisticated weapons and said big attacks would soon happen in England.He told David about an “excellent” assassin in Boston who he wanted to target “Tony Blair or somebody of that calibre”. Soon, authorities were urging David to give evidence against the terrorists in court. He refused. A turning point was the Real IRA’s Omagh bomb, which killed  people in the worst atrocity of the Troubles since they began in the late s. Maureen, based in Bundoran, Co Donegal, at the time, says: “We were reeling.  “I remember David coming home, I never saw anyone pack so fast. “We went to the airport and flew to Edinburgh to fly to London, just to get back to the US. We just had to get out of there. It was terrible. “When they asked us to testy, we decided it wouldn’t be a good thing to do. Then all of a sudden we saw a broadcast of the Omagh bombing. “It showed these poor kids, body parts everywhere. David looked at me and said, ‘We have to testy’.” In  David took the stand at McKevitt’s trial in Dublin. McKevitt was convicted of directing terrorism and membership of the IRA, and jailed for  years. David was accompanied out of Dublin by SAS bodyguards and flown out on a Hercules transport aircraft. McKevitt, now , was released in . Maureen says: “We lost some sleep but now our fear isn’t so much McKevitt. “There are a lot of sympathisers in Boston and Chicago who’d love to do us harm they want the badge saying they got Rupert.” David received almost poundmillion from the Federal Rewards for Justice fund. In  he was paid a final sum from the MI. O’Driscoll claims it is about pound,. In all, he received about pound.million from authorities. Yet the couple are both on prescription medication for anxiety and depression. In spite of this, Maureen says: “I would love to go back to Ireland but I don’t think it would ever be possible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle superfan recreates duchess","story":"NewsMeghan Markle superfan recreates Duchess of Sussexs stylish looks in spare timeLinda Martinez, , from Mexico, first saw Meghan as Rachel Zane in the American hit series Suits - and was immediately wowed by her sophisticated dress senseShareCommentsByBradley Jolly:,  JAN NewsLinda Martinez in the Club Monaco dress Meghan wore on a visit to the Hubb Community Kitchen \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis ultimate Meghan Markle superfan dedicates her spare time copying the Duchess of Sussexs impeccable fashion choices and sharing her looks on Instagram. Linda Martinez, , first saw Meghan as her Rachel Zane alter-ego in the American hit series Suits and was immediately wowed by her sophisticated dress sense. Linda, from Mexico City, Mexico, says she also became impressed with the royals personal backstory and humanitarian work. Now the -year-old shops around for a low-cost alternative to Meghans often pricey dresses and gowns. When budget allows, she even snatches up the original piece before it sells out. Incredible pictures show Linda, a business professional, channelling her inner Meghan whilst emulating the Duchess Sentaler coat outfit she wore to her first-ever Christmas church service at Sandringham in , the Club Monaco dress worn by the expectant first-time mum on a visit to the Hubb Community Kitchen which was opened after the Grenfell Tower disaster and a Reformation inspired sundress which was worn on the Sussexes tour of Australia in October last year.   Other images show Lindas take on the blue and white floral Oscar de la Renta dress which the Suits star wore to Princess Dianas niece, Celia McCorquodales wedding in June last year and her spin on Meghans Wimbledon outfit worn to the tennis competition with sister-in-law Kate Middleton. Linda has repli-Meghaned around  of the Duchess better known looks and has spent up to pound on a single coat. Ive always followed the royal family but when I learned about the engagement of Meghan and Harry, I got involved more with Meghan, said Linda. I was a Meghan fan because of Suits but when I did my research and I found out about her family and work, and all the things she has done to get what she has and where she is today, I started to admire her a lot and wanted to be like her. I wanted to be like her as a human being, shes an empowered woman and has the most incredible style.   I didnt have a defined style before and when I realised that I felt confident in the neutral colours, sophisticated combinations and this elegant yet comfortable way to dress I loved it. I really believe that someone like Meghan can feel confident, look good and still be a great human being. I guess is not easy for her [Meghan] to be there in the royal family with all the prejudices in society and classy people who maybe would only accept royals before.  Right now, we see her living a great le, but we dont know all the things she has had to change or accept to get that. I admire her strength and her kindness with people and that she is true to herself through it all. Linda is always looking for a bargain and snaps up her Meghan inspired outfits from Club Monaco, J.Crew, Aritzia, Zara, HM, Mango and even Amazon. Her all time favourite look of the Duchess is her stunning Givenchy wedding dress worn at her nuptials to Prince Harry in May last year.Linda is excited for the royal couples baby due this Spring.   I was so happy for them when they announced the news and Im quite sure it was their decision to have the baby regardless of what others would say about it, said Linda. Its amazing because she never stopped the royal agenda either. I love fashion, so I keep my eyes on the low-cost brands because sometimes they have things that are alike to Meghans outfits. If my budget allows me, I buy the original outfit,its not sold out. I just want to express my admiration for her by sharing my looks, my travels, what I love and makes me happy. Id like to express that a woman is free to express whatever she wants and to be a successful and happy woman no matter what people say.

All you are really thinking about day-to-day is the next game and getting three points.“Maybe afterwards there will be people talking about it and you are pleased you’ve got a win for him because it is the first time he’s been here.“Before a game, though, it’s not something we’re thinking about.”And,Nesbitt and his team-mates would have liked to have played better in front of the man who pays their wages, he believes the owner could take encouragement from the way United battled for three big points.In danger of being detached at the turn of the year, back-to-back defeats for Ross County and Ayr have left United just one win off the pace in the battle for automatic promotion.And,the former Celtic kid would have liked to have put on a better show for everyone who was at Tannadice, he knows getting the job done mattered most.“Three points and the results where went our way, that makes it a good day.“It was, obviously, a bit of a battle but we got there in the end and that’s what matters.Performance-wise it wasn’t the best and we would expect to play a lot better than that and put on a show but sometimes circumstances in a game mean it doesn’t go that way and then you need to grind it out and win it.”If Nesbitt was nothing like satisfied with his own display, he had the consolation of knowing for the second week running he played a part in a vital goal.His debut against Partick saw him win the penalty to earn United a point and on Saturday he provided the cross for Nicky Clark’s dramatic late winner.“It’s good to contribute when you’re new and I’ve done that in my first two games.“My game play against Dunfermline wasn’t good enough but to make contributions is important andI’m still making those contributions when I’m playing better I will be happy.”In setting up the all-important goal, Nesbitt showed character. He had not been happy with his performance but he wasn’t going to hide.“I had a pass that went nowhere and, before the goal, a cross that went right to their keeper.“When that happens you can put your head down and go into a shell, especially in a game like that one but you just need to keep going, believe in yourself.“I kept going and when I saw Cammy I cut it back to him. It came back out to me and I saw a couple of boys running. Nicky made a brilliant run and when I saw him I just put it in that area and let him meet it. He’s done that and finished brilliantly. It was scrappy but one good ball and one good header and it’s a good day.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c41d925525d28.88073341.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds sam stanton does not want to experience another scottish cup shock","story":"Sam Stanton has been on both ends of cup shocks in his time, and it’s the feeling when he was on the wrong end of one that makes him determined to make sure Dundee United win their fourth-round tie against Montrose.As a Hibs player, Stanton was part of the side that made an unexpected exit at the hands of Raith Rovers.That painful memory is one he does not want to experience again.“I’ve actually had good and bad in the cup and, hopefully, this can be another good memory,” said the midfielder.“When I was at Dumbarton, we had a couple of games where we weren’t expected to win and did, so that was a nice feeling.“But, when I was at Hibs, we were beaten by Raith and that definitely wasn’t a nice experience.“They were in the Championship and we were in the Premier League, so everyone expected us to get through. It wasn’t good when we lost.“That feeling is one you don’t want again and results like that one just show you can’t take anything for granted.“Teams in Scotland in all the leagues have good players and,you don’t have the proper approach, you will have problems.”And Stanton expects Montrose to battle tooth and nail to cause a shock tomorrow but believes United will be ready to cope with that.“These are dficult games because you know one team is giving everything they can to beat you because they have that nothing-to-lose mentality about them.“I’ve been there myself in those cup-ties when I was with Dumbarton, where you play teams who are bigger than your club and you don’t normally play against.“It excites you and it’s a chance for you to show how good you are. It’s why,you’re the bigger team, you can never take these games for granted.”He believes the key to avoiding a shock is treating the opposition with the respect they deserve and working towards the tie asit was a big game.“We have prepared for this one like we do every other game and that makes sure you have the right attitude.“The manager has had his videos of Montrose and been telling us about their strengths and weaknesses.“That way you make sure you are going into the game with the right mentality.”And,promotion from the Championship this term is by far the No  goal, Stanton admits he would love to go as far as possible in the cup.“A cup run is always important for the supporters and we know that.“For the players as well, it’s nice to do well and, as a football club, it is always important that we go as far as we can in the cup.“It’s another game we want to win and,you can string some wins together in the league and add a cup run to that as well, it’s always a help.”Stanton is also well aware that a side story tomorrow will be Tangerines legend Sean Dillon coming up against them for the first time since he ended a -year stay at Tannadice in .He expects the man who won the cup with United in  to get a rousing welcome from Arabs but, once that is out of the way and the game kicks off, it will be business as usual.“Sean left before I arrived at United but I know what a good player he was for the club.“He was here a long time and I’m sure he will get a good reception from our fans who travel up there.“For us, it’s about making sure he’s not the one getting clapped off the pitch after the game has finished.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c4079a3cf34a9.68815705.jpg ","title":"dundee winger andy dales looking to make instant impact","story":"Dundee winger Andy Dales is hoping to hit the ground running after checking in at Dens Park on loan from Scunthorpe United.The -year-old former Derby County youth academy product has joined up with the Dark Blues until the end of the season and goes straight into the squad for Saturday’s Scottish Cup fourth-round visit of Queen of the South.It was a deal that was agreed quickly, so much so, the England C international had to race north on Monday morning to complete the move.He has been in training with Jim McIntyre’s men since and is hoping to make his debut at Dens this weekend.“It’s been really good, I had a little chat with the gaffer on Tuesday morning and have had some intense training sessions so I’m really looking forward to it,” said Dales.“I only found out on Monday morning.

I’ve enjoyed it, the lads, the training, everything about it has been good,” said the man who is teaming up again with boss Jim McIntyre after their time together at Ross County.“The fitness levels are really good and the lads are at it. You can see they are up for the fight and there is some really good quality here, there’s no doubt about that, so it’s looking promising.”And the Liverpudlian believes three weeks off has given Dundee the chance to recharge their batteries.“I think the break has been a good thing, mentally in particular. I’ve been in this position and sometimes when you are in that rut when you are finding it dficult to pick up points it’s nice to have that break.“Mentally and physically you get away from it and then you come back in like it’s almost a new season, so I think it has been welcome.“And the mood here has been good but I don’t think I’ve been surprised by that because the lads know there is enough here and we are adding a few more bodies, so we know we have what’s needed.“We are up for a fight and you can see that looking round.”Curran believes that willingness, starting with tomorrow’s cup-tie, to do whatever it takes to get wins will be vital in the coming weeks.“There are times when it’s not going to be pretty because of where we’re at. There is going to be that sense of anxiousness going into games but we have that hunger and drive to overcome that.“There might be games that are ugly but these are ones we need to make sure we go on and win.“Whether we scrap it out - or -, we have to win and, once we do, we can then go and play a bit like I know we are capable of.”If, on paper, Dundee have been handed the perfect opportunity to report back with a win by being paired with a side from the second tier, Curran knows they’ll have to perform to make the next round.His time at Tannadice taught him there are decent outfits in that ision and, after facing them twice, he puts Queens in that category.“This is not going to be an easy game, just because they are in the Championship, no one can think that.“They have boys who are good players – Stephen Dobbie is on fire right now with his goals.“So, the mentality is the one thing we have to make sure is right and that’s not something I think we have an issue with. We have to make sure we come out on top, that’s our aim.”Curran also took the opportunity to stress he left United on good terms and thanked Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson for allowing him to move early in the January window.“I had a good relationship with Robbie and I only have good things to say about him.“The style he wanted was to play with one striker and Pavol Safranko has been the best player at United by a margin, I feel.“I understood that and he understood what an opportunity this move was for me.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c051af07378a-e1543840266799-940x555.jpg ","title":"tom duthie scottish football should never allow merger of dundees clubs","story":"The latest outbreak of merger fever in Dundee was no more than another in a long list of  alarms among the city’s football public.It’s not unlike the hypochondriac who catches a cold and immediately thinks he’s gone down with pneumonia.The revelation Dundee owner Tim Keyes wants to increase his shareholding to over % and remove the right of the club’s supporters’ society to veto any merger with neighbours United, had temperatures running high.With another American, Mark Ogren, now in control at Tannadice, fans of both clubs had been examining the “symptoms” and reached the diagnosis that a coming together was desired.That shows the accusation the media never let the facts get in the way of a good story can also, sometimes, be levelled at supporters.All along a forensic examination of the timeline of those symptoms strongly suggested this had everything to do with Keyes wanting to be able to build his new stadium at Camperdown without having to get the go-ahead from the fans’ group.Moving away from Dens is another on the list of protected items they can block and,Keyes is going to spend millions on “Nou Campie”, it’s not stretching the imagination to see why he might not want to need permission from a group that won’t be asked to inject a penny.More signicant is the fact Dundee first raised the matter months ago – before Ogren was on the scene at United. Even though this was a case of putting two and two together and getting five, it shows, despite merger being mooted and quickly dismissed on numerous occasions down the decades, it remains a worrying subject for the fans.And while those further afield may see a lot of sense in a one-club city, for those punters who actually turn up at Dens and Tannadice, it is the nightmare scenario. They’ll take hard times like financial crisis and relegation and stick with their team but what they’d never do is watch a merged team.That alone is why such a move is too dangerous. The clubs should always take the “nos” of the fans who go to games over the “I woulds” of potential new customers of a ‘Dundee City’.There is every chance a build-it-and-they-will-come merger would leave us with a club only slightly bigger than the two that exist.That wouldn’t just be bad for the city but Scottish football and it makes it surprising that, when the topic is raised, no one at the top of the game has come out against it.While sporting performance is rightly the normal criteria for the make-up of our top ision,ever it was to be done on size of club, Dundee and United would be in there – and comfortably so.If Premiership membership was decided on that second basis the top  would be something like Celtic, Rangers, Aberdeen, Hearts, Hibs, Dundee United, Dundee, Motherwell, Kilmarnock, St Johnstone, Falkirk and St Mirren.The likes of Morton, Dunfermline and Inverness may argue they should be in there but it would be on the basis they have more potential than the names at the end of that list.When it comes to core support, the first seven clubs listed are untouchable. If Glasgow giants Rangers or Celtic, on their own, are bigger than the rest put together, those from the country’s three other major cities are also well ahead of the others below them.To reiterate, in all but exceptional circumstances, results should determine who’s in the top league, so it’s up to the likes of United to get back there by winning matches.But when the Tangerines and the Dark Blues are in the top flight, Scottish football is the better for it.That will always be the case."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c420e22491638.93486908.jpg ","title":"tributes to bowling legend kevin","story":"Tributes have been paid to a Dundee bowling “legend” following his death from cancer aged just .Kevin Brunton, from Mid Craigie, played bowls locally and nationally for almost  years.The former Morgan Academy pupil racked up a number of honours in both indoor and outdoor competitions over the years.After losing his battle with oesophageal cancer, Kevin’s brother Calum, , led the tributes.He said: “Kevin won numerous titles, both indoor and outdoor.“He was a Dundee bowling legend.

The last two seasons were spent battling against relegation with the Staggies and, in the   season he was at Dundee United when they were relegated.The -year-old is embracing the pressure on the Balmoor outfit and said: “It’s a nice feeling to be involved in this. When I was at United we were under pressure to win every week.“But we were never really in a title race, there were a couple of times we started well but it was never a full-on title race.“There was one yearus and Aberdeen were still with Celtic in January and early February but it was always going to be hard to sustain.“Then, at County, for the last couple of years it has been down battling at the bottom of the league.“So it’s nice to have a dferent kind of pressure. We’re expected to win every week but it’s a much better pressure to have on you.“You would rather have the pressure of trying to push for a title than the pressure of relegation.”Despite defeat to Clyde a fortnight ago, Peterhead are handily positioned in the League Two title race.Jim McInally’s men are three points behind leaders Edinburgh City with a game in hand.Tomorrow Berwick Rangers visit Buchan and Dow is looking to continue his rich vein of form, which has resulted in three goals in his last three games.He added: “I’m just looking for my form to continue. After three goals in three games, I just want to add to that.“I’m playing well and contributing with goals and assists is what my game is about.“I’ve been working hard and we’ve been winning, apart from the Clyde game, which has been good.“If I can do well and contribute to us winning then it’s happy days.”Berwick have struggled this season and currently sit second bottom.However, Dow is wary of the Wee Gers.

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13865741.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_JS172700549.jpg","title":"brexit conservative remainer mp admits","story":"NewsBrexit: Conservative Remainer MP admits he would consider voting Leave in second referendumBill Grant says \"arrogance\" from EU negotiators may push him towards voting Leaveany second referendum arose.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsBill Grant MP \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Scots Tory MP says he would consider performing a Brexit u-turnBritain goes back to the polls.

Tory group leader Martin Dowey made the plea for the area to be more car-friendly following the announcement of the closure of Hourstons last week. Councillor Dowey urged the council to ease parking charges in the High Street in a bid to encourage more footfall to the area. Speaking at Seafield, Fort and Wallacetown Community Council last Wednesday, he said: “I am frustrated and saddened at Hourstons closing. “Given the retail climate, it wasn’t unexpected.” The councillor said internet and retail park shopping had contributed to the demise of town centres across the country. “Town centre shops need to be smaller and more niche,” he added. “The town centre is far too big for the size of Ayr.   “We need to utilise what we have got to encourage footfall.” SNP ward councillor Siobhian Brown is disappointed that the iconic store is to close and said a long-term plan is needed to attract more people back to the town centre. “It is a sign of times as people buy online,” she added. Norman McLean, the community council’s chairman, said: “It didn’t get the footfall. It was only a couple of months ago I was in the store and I felt like I was the only person there. “Has the council got any contingency plans  “What about waiving the cost of the first hour parking at parking meters ” The meeting heard that Hourstons were paying pound, per year in business rates before they started paying staff and other costs. Now the iconic building could be turned into flats or used by the council for offices.   Councillor Dowey added: “We need more parking and we have to bring cars back into the High Street. “The one-way system brought in the s was probably a good idea then but it is not such a good idea now. “People don’t drive down the High Street as much any more and they don’t see how bad the bottom end is. “I am guilty as anyone because I go to Heathfield for shopping because you can get parking there.” One community councillor said more must be done to attract sport and culture to the town centre to get people back there. “Retail cannot be sustained,” he insisted. “We need cultural tourism to do draw people into the town centre.” Another pointed out that shops in Prestwick and Troon are thriving: “The dference between Prestwick and Ayr is that they have all small units and in Ayr it is all big High Street units for the past  or  years. Big units cost too much.” "},{"url":null,"title":"change-of-lawyers-delays-trial-of-nursery-workers-accused-of-cruelty","story":"THE trial of two nursery workers accused of behaving in a threatening

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

Today at pm and .pm in Glasgow Royal Concert there are screenings of Disneyrsquos Scottish fantasy animation Brave with Doylersquos soundtrack performed live by the orchestra under the baton of Dirk Brosse and guest musicians who featured on the original recording. Then on Thursday at Glasgow City Halls, the orchestra and Brosse perform a programme that combines selections from Doylersquos other film scores alongside new and old pieces that the composer has arranged for the occasion and which will feature contributions from members of his family.ldquoI was asked by Donald Shaw to write some original pieces, which I have done. I have written a piece for choir and orchestra that is a setting of William Dunbarrsquos poem Sweet Rose of Virtue which will be performed in the original old Scots by the Glasgow Phoenix Choir. The second new piece is a Scottish Overture, which is about six minutes long and will be the finale of the second half.CinematographerMichael McDonough: From a Scottish council house to HollywoodldquoPlus I have a piece I wrote as part of a Celtic song-cycle just for fun and which was used in the film Whisky Galore but has never been performed live. It will be sung by Maggie McInnes and my two daughters are singing as well. Abigail will sing Tir na Nog from Into the West, which was directed by Mike Newell, and Nuala is singing Never Forget from Murder on the Orient Express, which was originally sung by Michelle Pfefer.Family connections are important to Doyle, who himself arrived in the middle of family of  in Uddingston, whose sisters Ellen and Margaret are singers , and whose father was an opera-loving tenor who idolised John McCormack.ldquoBut I was the only one of the family who studied music. I had started picking out tunes by ear on a glockenspiel as a kid, and then my folks got me a piano. At Our Ladies High School in Motherwell I had a very good music teacher, but she left for a promotion in my fth year so there was no teacher to take me into my Highers. I was in a terrible state as there was nothing  that I was interested in. So four of us asked to go to Dalziel High School in Motherwell, where we had great teachers, and I sailed through the audition for the Academy from there.Celtic Connections: The  best showsldquoThe Academy, is of course, the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and an institution that was pivotal in the making of Doylersquos multaceted career.Young Patrick had gone to the Junior Academy as a schoolboy who was playing in brass bands as well as studying piano. But he also remembers being aware of how music was used on screen from an early age.ldquoThey used to call me square eyes in the house because I was never away from the television, but I was always studying the construct of it. I used to love watching Bilko [the American comedy series starring Phil Silvers], and was always aware of the music, as well the other technical details of the way that the programme was made. I clocked all that stuff when I was young.ldquoBut when I went to the Academy it was to pursue music. I think I thought Irsquod probably end up teaching, and the idea of that was quite appealing. But I was very interested in the drama there as well, and my fellow student Morag Fullerton approached me to write the music for her play at the Edinburgh Fringe and then to co-write a musical review and perform in it.From there Pat Doyle, as he styled himself then, found a job with TAG, the theatre-in-education company at the Citizens, before being asked by playwright John Byrne to read for the part of Hector in The Slab Boys. The David Hayman-directed premiere, with Billy McColl, Jim Byars, Robbie Coltrane and Elaine Collins was a huge hit at Edinburghrsquos Traverse Theatre and transferred to London. On the strength of it, Doyle and his we Leslie, who had studied stage management at the RSAMD and worked as a wardrobe supervisor for stage and TV, moved south.ldquoThe Slab Boys was such a success that casting directors would see me as an actor at the drop of a hat, Doyle remembers, but he was not willing to let go of his love for music. ldquoI wasnrsquot happy with le going for auditions, and I felt I needed to pursue my music.CinematographerMichael McDonough: From a Scottish council house to HollywoodA meeting with Kenneth Branagh led to a job as musical director with his Renaissance Shakespeare company, with some stage roles as well, and a UK tour with a company that included Judi Dench, Derek Jacobi and Geraldine McEwan. When Branagh made his film of Henry V, Doyle wrote the music and when the movie opened in Los Angeles it was at the same time as the company were there on tour, so the Doyles settled in LA with their two young children ndash and a bank loan from Barclays ndash while he looked for more film-score work. He has produced them at the rate of between one and three a year since, including during the period at the start of the new millennium when he was being treated for leukemia.His most recent score is for another Branagh movie, a Shakespeare bio-pic All Is True in which the writer and director appears alongside Dame Judi and Sir Ian McKellen.ldquoI still write by hand initially, says Doyle, ldquoand for that I chose two Shakespeare texts and composed two songs at the piano that are the thematic foundation for the score. There is a natural rhythm in the poetry that gives you the basis for a melody.For other scores inspiration can strike less conveniently. ldquoFor Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I heard the Potter Waltz in my head during a meeting and had to ask for paper to jot down the melody line. I donrsquot compose a piece for film that canrsquot stand up on a concert stage. Something like Harry in Winter, from the Goblet of Fire score, is written exactly as yoursquoll hear it in concert.Celtic Connections: The  best showsBut when it comes to a score like that for Brave, there is work to be done on the dynamics for a live performance. ldquoThat has had to be rebalanced for this concert, and thatrsquos been months and months of work.

He starred in many, a cluster celebrating his lack of punctuality. It was fitting, therefore, that he was almost late for his own funeral. An accident delayed his final trip to Islay. It was why bemused drivers on the road to Kennacraig ferry terminal witnessed a hearse going so fast it should have been fitted with a siren and flashing lights.Time and tide would not wait for UisdeanMacDonald so it was with some relief that an emergency stop on the last ferry of the day was followed immediately by the klaxon signalling the closing of the doors and the subsequent gentle slide towards Islay. There were three audible sighs of relief in the hearse, emanating from Brian and Bobby, the estimable undertakers, and from me, a son relieved that the funeral the next day would not be deprived of a somewhat necessary guest. The frantic, even febrile area of my brain also ined a mutter from the casket that said: ldquoNever in doubt.The question that did occur to me on that chilly night in December  and has gently haunted me thereafter is: why it was imperative for a man born and bred in Possil, of Irish and Cromarty stock, to be buried on island he first visited in middle age As a businessman he travelled the world, spending some time as an executive in Iran, but when he retired early through ill health he retreated to Islay. He was to spend  years as an Ileach, flitting occasionally back across the water to a flat in Busby. But wherever he was he retained the air of a Gael. ldquoI am descended from Somerled, Lord of the Isles, he would tell me. ldquoAye, Somerled of High Possil, Lord of the Co-op aisles, I would reply, evoking the family mantra of lsquorsquo you canrsquot be funny at least be wounding.He was vindicated dramatically after his death. On the day my brother sent me a photograph of his newly erected gravestone, I was called to the editorrsquos office. I had been selected for a DNA test to discover my heritage. The results were in. lsquoInteresting on your motherrsquos side, said the organiser of the test. ldquoThere is Slav, Russian and Jewish lines. But your dadrsquos side is pretty boring.ldquoWhy  I asked.ldquoIt is % Celt, he replied.ldquoSo I am a son of Somerled ldquoYes.FIVE years on, in the summer of last year, I ed to Islay for the first time since the funeral. It was planned as a break at my sisterrsquos holiday home with my partner, Alison. There was no conscious desire to find a trace of my father. But he was everywhere. There was no stated purpose to discover why he was seduced by Islay. But its charms were almost gaudily presented in a week the island was gilded by sunshine and by that peculiar, pure light that seems only to alight on Hebridean islands or Highland scenes that God in his generosity created for personal, spiritual uplt and the postcard industry. This was the first time I had been on the island without my father. It was, of course, impossible to avoid him. The proprietor of the Celtic House, a gt shop in Bowmore with a splendid selection of books, immediately recognised me as both a son of Somerled and of Uisdean.Hugh MacDonald on football and fatherhoodHis presence was recalled in pub, restaurant and even the Museum of Islay Le where some of his artefacts have found a resting place. I felt his presence on the walk from Port Ellen along the Three Distilleries Walk. Its eight milesjourney encompasses the Laphroaig, Lagavulin and Ardbeg distilleries. The crash of the waves on the walk and the warming wind of an extraordinary summer carried more than a whisper of my dad. It was in the Gaelic names, it was in the smell of the malts he consumed mostly sensibly and quietly, sometimes as fuel for raucous, invigorating singing.He was there, too, when I embarked on a walk along the Big Strand. This is a stretch of shore that once witnessed Uisdean as official beachcomber. He would stride into the face of ineffable beauty while retaining an eye for inconsequential rubbish. My long-delayed maturity as an adult can be measured by my increasing hesitation at acquiescing to his instructions to pick up something ldquointeresting toto his home. These ldquointeresting objects included metal buoys, discarded rope and, once, aof wood that I now believe was his crowning glory in his career of winding up No. son. I carried it for five miles, believing he had spotted something of aesthetic, even historic interest. Onto his house, it was promptly cut up and thrown on the fire.Fittingly, it was Finlaggan where the growing idea of a present Uisdean became a reality that first jarred then soothed. Finlaggan was the seat of the Lord of the Isles and of Clan Donald from the th to th century. They were sons of Somerled too. The Finlaggan Trust runs a site that holds more than memory for me. A visit there was mandatory on any stay at my fatherrsquos house. He snfed about the site with the energy of a bloodhound following the scent of a particularly odorous herd of deer.There was always something to attract his attention. He would peer towards the islands that were once the administrative centre for the Clan Donald. He would prowl about the ruins of the chapel with an enthusiasm that suggested that he believed the poor box was lying unopened in the debris.Hugh MacDonald on football and fatherhoodIt remains a MacDonald stronghold. His granddaughter was married there in . The visitor centre also displays a selection of the legacy he left, from swords to shields. One of his chairs sits in the centre, overlooking the High House of the Lord of the Isles. It was the easiest decision to give these items to the centre on his death.ldquoThis where we are from, he would say as he strode back to the car, lted by another visit to the Donald den. ldquoWe choose who we are in some ways and many of them are important, he once told me. ldquoBut we are linked to a past too and that is as important as you feel it to be. He felt it deeply in terms of a love of Celtic culture, an attachment to Caledonian landscape and in the sentiment and signicance of being a Gael. ldquoYou have to know who you are, he once advised me. He was a great-grandfather, grandfather, father, brother, politician, businessman, singer and poet. He was, too, a son of Somerled.IT lies just off the road, beyond a fence and down a lane. The Nerabus cemetery has other names. It is called the Donegal monks cemetery by some. It is signposted as the ancient burial grounds of the MacDonalds. It is the resting place of Uisdean within walking distance of his last home on the road to Portnahaven from Port Charlotte. It is not only fitting site but one that will always give signs to who he was and why he believed it mattered.On a glorious day in June, I abandoned the car at roadside and walked down to his grave from the first time since Friday, December , . I gave his gravestone a wipe and looked down Loch Indaal towards Northern Ireland whence sprung the McDonnels, McDonalds and MacDonalds who perch on one side of a family tree. They were mainly stonemasons, mostly from Antrim or Donegal. They pitched up with regularity on the west coast of Scotland and in Glasgow.My dad had originally bought a plot at the beautul round church in Bowmore. He was a character who was aware of death but never seemed frightened of it. He designed his own gravestone, left precise instructions for his funeral and who should give the eulogy and, ultimately, switched his grave to Nerabus.Why There were hints at the funeral. The splendour of the setting was oddly enhanced rather than disguised by the sort of December day that sent rain spitting spitefully through the air in the trajectory favoured by demonic machine gunners. But Northern Ireland was visible. It seemed close enough for Charon to ferry Uisdean to a place beyond le. He died with the same silver coin in his hand that his late father, Hugh, held when he died in . The instruction to my brother, Roddy, was to press it into his hand when death beckoned so that the spiritual ferryman could be paid his due.The connection was to the past was strengthened with a quiet word from one of the islanders who told me that Nerabus was the final destination for many of the Lords of the Isles. But it was the journey back to the purvey by bus that roared a message about who my father was and what he believed. The driver of the hired coach muttered to me that he had to stop briefly in Bowmore before he could take us to the hotel in Port Ellen where haufs, sausage rolls and words of comfort awaited.Consolation, though, came early and powerfully. With my head pressed against the window of the bus, the flecks of rain obscuring the outside world, I was momentarily startled by the swoosh of the bus doors opening in Bowmore and stunned by the childish chatter and laughs that swirled through a bus half-filled by mourners. The truth dawned quickly: the driver, with the funeral running late, had doubled up on the school bus run.One of my dadrsquos mates, who like so many others had left home at am to make the funeral and would not be back home until the next day, looked across at me. There was only one way to react. I burst out laughing. He joined in enthusiastically. The bus enveloped grinning mourners and pupils excited, as only teenagers can be, by the possibilities of a weekend.My response was subsequently considered. The laughter was provoked by three realisations. First, the driverrsquos duty was to the tradition of island le and children could not be left in the rain no matter who had died. Second, my father would have appreciated this and would have applauded the general sentiment that le must go on. He was a Gael and that had its emotional hold but he was also a character who knew that death could be sore but it must be overcome.But, most of all, he would have exulted in the wonderful spectacle of babbling, happy schoolchildren banishing the mournful looks from those he loved and who loved him. It may have been his last gt. It was a profoundly appropriate one. His funeral bequeathed an anecdote. I still tell it. My dad, after all, loved a story."},{"url":null,"title":"kaf-coffee-hyndland-street-glasgow-reviewed-by-ron-mackenna","story":" Hyndland StreetSUCH are the risks of dipping into weekend micro-cafe culture these days that we decide to eat before we go.

What would not be immediately clear is that Murphys crime, in the eyes of those who would silence her, is stating that men cannot become women.In fact her opponents would argue this is not just a crime in their eyes, but also according to the laws of the land. The reach of these laws ndash some federal, others provincial ndash is currently being tested, including in high-profile legal actions that are making headlines around the world.So why is a discussion on Gender Identity Ideology and Womens Rights so controversial, and what can Scotland learn from Canada about how to legislate around the contentious area of transgender rights  Equally, what might Canada be able to learn from us Our two nations have a few things in common. Each has a neighbour to the south with a population about ten times higher, each is led by a self-declared feminist, and each governing party prides itself on being progressive, especially in comparison to those southern neighbours. The leaders of both countries are, accordingly, loudly and proudly committed to promoting LGBT rights.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was already a regular at Pride marches before his election in , while last year Nicola Sturgeon led Glasgow Pride during Donald Trumps visit to Scotland, shortly before the Scottish Government committed to including LGBT issues across the school curriculum. Back in November , weeks after Sturgeon apologised at Holyrood to gay men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer illegal, Trudeau issued a formal apology in the Ottawa legislature for the past oppression of the LGBTQ communities.Incidentally, the ldquo stands for two-spirited, a term that refers exclusively to indigenous people with distinct spiritual and ceremonial roles in their communities.SHONA CRAVEN: Why we have so much to learn from lsquoold and irrelevantrsquo womenThe worldwide gender identity debate is, at heart, a debate about the meaning of words. In particular, the words ldquowoman, ldquoman and \"lesbian\". It is a debate about whether iniduals, groups, political parties or governments have the right to redefine those words, then compel others to accept the new meanings.The meaning of \"woman\" matters because this has implications for women-only spaces such as toilets, changing rooms and refuges. It matters because of the impact on all-women shortlists and womens sports. It matters because women around the world suffer discrimination as a consequence of being born female.Because the meaning of words directly affects how people ndash including the small minority who are transgender ndash navigate their day-to-day lives, this is a heated debate. And while many women politely nod along with mantras like \"transwomen are women\", either believing themselves to be progressive or fearful of the consequences of doing otherwise, many feminists are refusing to comply.It is a sufficiently heated debate that when Murphy and her fellow lists started to address an audience of around  women late on a Thursday night last week, there were more than two dozen security guards in the room and police officers too.Those who challenge the idea that men can become womenhave been called many things ndash ldquoTERFs , transphobes, bigots and even Nazis but in Canada ldquocoloniser is added to the mix, with the implication that such iniduals are also anti-indigenous people, anti-immigrant and pro-deportations. This goes down badly with those among their opponents who are indeed radical feminists, aligned to the left.Murphy grew up in a left-wing household, with a father who campaigned for Canadas New Democratic Party. But in recent years, since ldquocoming out as critical of gender identity ideology, she has found herself courted by those on the right, even those who strongly disagree with her positions on other issues such as abortion. When she was last year handed a permanent ban from social media site Twitter for questioning gender identity ideology ndash and then questioning Twitter for punishing her for doing so ndash she received a flood of supportive messages from right-wingers including Ben Shapiro, the influential US commentator.ldquoOf course Im aware that some of those outlets are using me for their own means, which is like, look at what the left is doing, its eating itself, but I dont really care, because theyre right, she says with a wry laugh.She believes politicians on the left who have backed a steady stream of policy changes informed by gender identity ideology ndash relating to everything from signage and the census to prisons and hate speech ndash are poorly informed. ldquoI think the politicians are advised to take a certain line and dont at all understand the implications of the arguments, and dont really think about it very much ... and eventhey did Im sure they would be too scared to say anything.Among those who have taken that line is Vancouvers newly elected mayor, Kennedy Stewart, who said of Murphys event: ldquoI find it despicable ... its not something I support at all. Murphy attempted to contact Stewart to find out what, exactly, he found despicable , but she received no response. Its clear, however, that Vancouver is very keen to promote itself as an LGBT-friendly city. Signs on lampposts ldquocelebrate queer Vancouver, stickers on doors announce ldquosafe places and rainbow and trans flags adorn public buildings.Unlike in Scotland, where the Scottish Trans Alliance has received government funding since , in Canada there is no national organisation pushing for changes to transgender rights. There are also no national womens rights campaign groups comparable to the UK-wide Fair Play for Women, Womens Place UKor For Women Scotland, arguing for the importance of protections based on biological sex. As a result there has been very little public debate about the implications of signicant changes ndash that is, except for the very public opposition of psychology professor Jordan Peterson to the inclusion of gender identity as a prohibited ground of discrimination.The question of gender identity has been in the news on this side of the Atlantic for months due to proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act ndash a piece of legislation that was passed following a European Court of Human Rights case in . The introduction of the GRA meant that people who identied as the opposite sex could change their legal sex by amending their birth certicates. At that time it was already possible to change the sex recorded on documents such as driving licences and passports, but transwoman Christine Goodwin argued that because she had been refused a new National Insurance number that reflected her new identity, an employer had gained knowledge of her past living as a man and discriminated against her on this basis. The court ruled that preventing trans people from changing their legal sex contravened the European Convention on Human Rights.As the law stands, those applying to change their birth certicates must satisfy a  of medical and legal professionals that they have experienced gender dysphoria, defined by the NHS as ldquoa condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because theres a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity have lived in their acquired gender for two years and intended to live in that gender for le. Concepts such as ldquoliving in a gender were not defined in the legislation, with their interpretation left to those appointed to Gender Recognition Panels. Transgender activists now argue that restrictive, stereotypical notions of gender are used to assess whether an applicant is indeed ldquoliving in a given gender, and that the UKs approach wrongly characterises transgender identities as evidence of psychological problems. These are among the reasons why they argue that the UKshould adopt a system of gender self-ID, scrapping Gender Recognition Panels and instead requiring applicants to make a statutory declaration about their identity.The debate about Scotlands census, changes to which are being considered by the Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs Committee, has become a proxy debate about self-ID, highlighting the fact that the current census format conflates sex and gender . The Scottish Government consulted on reforms to the Gender Recognition Act last year, and has pledged to bring forward legislation in this area soon.Official attitudes in Scotland have changed over time, due in large part to the efforts over the past decade of James Morton of the Scottish Trans Alliance. Writing about the challenges of securing and retaining funding for a trans-specic equality project, Morton has noted that the SNP, which inherited his pilot project from the previous coalition government in , ldquowere keen for the rest of Europe to recognise Scotland as a progressive, innovative country. He also explains the strategic thinking behind working with the Scottish Prison Service to introduce a gender identity policy ndashprisons could be persuaded to adopt a policy based on self-declaration in ldquovery challenging circumstances, other public services would likely follow.SHONA CRAVEN: Why we have so much to learn from lsquoold and irrelevantrsquo womenThose challenging circumstances have been in the spotlight since it emerged that Karen White, a male rapist who identies as a woman but is still legally male, had sexually assaulted female inmates after being remanded in a womens prison in England. White was described as an ldquoalleged transgender female by a prosecutor who suggested there was little evidence of any meaningful transition, but last week it was reported that the serial sex offender ndash who is serving a le sentence ndash is seeking cash from friends to fund gender reassignment surgery, in the belief this will guarantee a transfer back to the female estate.Trans activists argue that such cases are exceptions and that those who oppose prison policies based on self-ID are unfairly seeking to portray all transgender people as sexual predators. Womens rights groups argue that vulnerable women in prison, many of whom have experienced physical and sexual violence, have the right to be housed separately from males.They also argue that spaces such as womens refuges should be permitted to refuse males, and in Canada this is a contentious subject. Back in , a transwoman named Kimberly Nixon sought to volunteer as a counsellor for Vancouver Rape Relief, and when she was rejected on the grounds that she had not been born female she took the charity to the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal. She won the case, and was awarded , for injury to her self-respect and dignity, but the charity sought a judicial review and the case ended up in the Supreme Court, which ruled against Nixon and asserted that the charity was entitled to apply its women-only policy.Lee Lakeman, a pioneering feminist and fierce advocate for abused women, worked at Vancouver Rape Relief for  years. She joined the  for Murphys event in the city and delivered a passionate defence of female-only spaces, warning: ldquoTo those who imagine you can bully us into submission: you are clearly unfamiliar with us.One might imagine that a transgender person taking a rape charity to court would have damaged the cause of transgender rights, but it appears only to have damaged the charity. When a business in the city recently displayed a poster advertising a Rape Relief fundraiser in its window, its owner received a barrage of abuse and negative Facebook reviews. It remains to be seen whether a male taking more than a dozen female beauticians to the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal claiming discrimination on gender identity grounds ndash after they all refused to wax ldquoher male genitals ndash will be similarly supported by the transgender community and its allies.In the end Murphys event passed without disruption, perhaps unsurprisingly given the muscle on hand to enforce it. By the time the last stragglers left ndash in pairs for their safety, as instructed ndash they found that many of those who had been chanting out in the cold had since abandoned their placards and gone home. However, a local trans activist later argued that by allowing the event to be broadcast online, Vancouver Public Library knowingly took part in ldquopublishing to the internet an incitement to discriminate on the basis of gender identity or expression, an action prohibited by section seven of the Human Rights Code.As the Canadian left continues to eat itself, Scotland is having an in-depth discussion about what it means to be a woman or a man, in law and in our society. The wording of questions on the census might not seem like a vitally important matter, but the Canadian experience shows just how quickly small changes can have far-reaching effects."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-i-only-need-to-look-in-the-mirror-to-see-ravages-of-time","story":"I only need to look in the mirror though, to see the changes the ravages, of time.I arrived here a chain smoker with another Afghan Hound by my side ndash Portia ndash filled with a mixture of horror and excitement at what Irsquod done.The horror began on turning up to the sight unseen flat Irsquod rented, via my estate agent who owned it, to find a dingy, miserable apartment with an unmade bed and nylon, multi-coloured sheets.A Summer storm, with hailstones the size of tennis balls, had smashed rooves, cars, windows, and closed the only shop, leaving the pair of us huddled together in a dark and dismal sitting room.I spent that first night sobbing to the friends Irsquod left behind certain Irsquod made the biggest mistake of my le in a knee jerk defiant reaction to my redundancy from a ridiculously well-paid job.I became someone I didnrsquot know as I wailed, nose running, howling in my misery as they tried to comfort me from a distance that suddenly seemed insurmountable.Eventually, exhausted, drained, Irsquod crawled into the rainbow bed, comforted by the dog who curved into my back happy just to be with me, wherever we went.I woke, eyes boiled, to a determined sun pushing through the window and forcing me up.In the week that followed as I signed and initialed the numerous papers to make this folly my own opened accounts and policies I settled into a sort of shocked, happy, anticipatory acceptance.The heat helped. The sun wrapping me in its embrace as I sat in mediaeval squares supping wine, helped. The cheap fags I could smoke anywhere helped.Portia, who suddenly threw off city allergies and food fads, turned into a contented being accepting all homages to her beauty without strangling herself to get away from other humans.And that more than helped.

Ms Aitken still has to get sign off from a full council her party only has minority control of while the women - who are represented iously by Mr Crossrsquos firm Action  Equality Scotland and trade unions the GMB, Unison and Unite - will need to agree their inidual settlements.Given the time and effort that has gone into reaching the agreement, those matters are considered to be formalities, although there could be a small number of cases where further negotiation is required.The bigger issue from the councilrsquos point of view will be raising the necessary finance to ensure it can meet its stated aim of settling all , claims by December this year.It will be no small task. Though Ms Aitken made settling the dispute a priority when she took over from Labourrsquos Frank McAveety in , the previous administration had been so convinced that it could defeat the women through the courts that it made practically no financial provision for a potential settlement.With less than poundm in its contingency fund when Labour left office, the SNP-led council set aside poundm in the   financial year, all of which will now be put towards the settlement.It will also look to extend its existing debt facilities - which at the end of   stood poundm lower than a year previously at pound. billion - and mortgage some of the non-operational buildings held on its behalf by arms- organisation City Property.While raising half a billion pounds should not cause too much of a problem for a council as asset-rich as Glasgow, it is understood that all those financing deals are yet to be done meaning time, more than anything, is going to be of the essence.Then, of course, there will be the future to deal with.The starting point for this entire process was the pay structure put in place in  following an agreement between the Labour administration and the then male-dominated trade unions.Although it was supposed to eradicate an unfair system that had previously seen male workers earn bonuses their female counterparts were not entitled to, in truth all that pay scheme did was lock those bonuses in, perpetuating the inequality in the process.While the poundm settlement will compensate the women for that, the discredited pay system - and so the pay inequality - will remain in place for at least the next two years while work gets under way on devising a new scheme.It is going to be a complicated process, not just because there is an obvious need to get it right this time, but because it is going to require the value of , dferent jobs to be assessed, compared and signed off by both the council and the unions.When it is done, a further settlement will have to be negotiated to make amends for any pay inequalities during the period between this weekrsquos poundm settlement being paid out and the new pay grades taking effect .As Unison Scottish secretary Mike Kirby said when the settlement was agreed on Thursday: ldquoWhile we have made great progress, we still have a lot of work to do.With the council facing bringing thousands of female workersrsquo pay packets into line with those of just a few hundred male staff one thing is for sure: it promises to continue to be a costly business."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-kelvingrove-museum-prepares-to-put-dippy-the-dinosaur-on-display","story":"But after his long journey from Northern Ireland, the museum has spent the last few days piecing together its latest visitor ndash the biggest ever to come to Kelvingrove.Dippy is a .-metre dinosaur skeleton cast on a tour of the UK, and will be unveiled in Glasgow on Tuesday.He has travelled across the Irish Sea from the Ulster Museum in Belfast, and has spent days after arriving in  dferent crates, as his body is slowly pieced together by museum staff.Once complete, Dippy will stand in the main hall of the museum underneath the famous Kelvingrove organ.It will take a team of experts from the skeletonrsquos home museum, Londonrsquos Natural History Museum, five days to arrange the -bone casts into the diplodocusrsquos original form.The final piece, a toe bone, will be placed on Tuesday morning.Lorraine Cornish, who is leading the team, said: ldquoAs Dippy on Tour approaches the half-way point, having proved a huge success at the first three destinations, it seems very fittingthat the next stop is a homecoming of sorts.ldquoThe Scottish leg of the tour, where the creation of the NHM Dippy cast was first discussed, is the perfect destination to reflect on the many people Dippy has so far inspired to explore their own natural world.ldquoWe hope the visitors to Dippy in Glasgow will be equally enthralled by this Jurassic ambassador.Dippy is a plaster cast replica of a diplodocus skeleton, made in  at the request of King Edward VII.The original skeleton of diplodocus carnegii is named after Andrew Carnegie, the Scottish-American steel magnate and philanthropist who financed its excavation in Wyoming, US in .After visiting Carnegie at his Scottish castle, where he saw a sketch of the dinosaur, King Edward commissioned a replica cast for Londonrsquos Natural History Museum.Carnegie paid pound, for the cast to be taken and donated it to the museum.It was unveiled in  and has stood there ever since.Carnegie also paid for casts to be displayed in other European capitals, including Berlin, Paris and Vienna.In late , Londonrsquos Dippy was replaced with the -metre skeleton of a young blue whale named Hope, so the dinosaur tour could begin.Dippyrsquos tour will see him visit a number of museums around the country, and the Natural History Museum intends for five million visitors in the UK to see the skeleton.The Kelvingrove Museum is the only place in Scotland on the tourrsquos itinerary.Councillor David McDonald, chairman of Glasgow Le, said: ldquoDippy is here.

His latest vehicular escapade comes after a long le of seeking out powerful cars and other conveyances to hone is skills.The former Conservative MP Gyles Brandreth, a friend for  years of the Duke and also his biographer, said that his love of driving has been a le-long affair.Speaking on BBC Radio , he said: ldquoHe did enjoy fast cars. When he first met the Queen and when they began courting in the s he had a little MG sports car, and hersquod drive in that pretty fast by the Queenrsquos own account and I think he had a couple of prangs.ldquoThe he got an Aston Martin, and famously he had a Lagonda coupe which could go at mph.ldquoHe enjoyed fast driving and the engineering of a fast car, so this will be frustrating for him, as well as a great concern.The Lagonda, which was also built by Aston Martin, was no ordinary car. A  -litre, four-seater Drophead Coupe, it was made to order for the Duke and boasted a radio carphone and an extra vanity mirror, said to have been installed so the Queen could check her hat as they drove along.Legend has it that Prince Philip regularly used the car phone to make prank calls to Prince Charles, disguising his voice to prolong the joke.The royal couple were regularly spotted in the classic sportscar as he drove through Cowdray Park in West Sussex, where the Duke played polo.Mr Brandreth recalled: ldquoWhen he was younger he was a dynamo. He did everything fast and he could be impatient.ldquoHis cousin, Countess Mountbatten told me that her father Lord Mountbatten was once driving with the Queen and Prince Phillip through Cowdray Park and Prince Phillip was going far too fast. According to Lord Mountbatten the Queen was sort of yelping and drawing in her breath, flinching as he drove so fast.ldquoPrince Phillip turned to her and said lsquoLook,you do that once more I will put you out of the carrsquo.ldquoAnd when the hair-raising journey came to an end, Lord Mountbatten asked the Queen why she hadnrsquot protested, and she replied lsquoYou heard what he said ndash and he meant it.rsquoAside from fast cars, the Duke was also a keen aviator, taking up flying in  and clocking up more than , air miles in the cockpit of almost  dferent types of aircraft.Before earning his private pilotrsquos licence in , he gained his helicopter wings with the Royal Navy in  and was the first royal family member to ever fly out of Buckingham Palace Garden in a helicopter.He finally gave up flying in , when he was aged .But when it comes to horses, the Duke remains in the saddle, so to speak. After giving up polo at the age of , he took up horse-drawn carriage racing, beginning by practising in the grounds of Sandringham and eventually racing at the World Champions in .He was photographed in the summer driving a horse-drawn carriage, although he has given up competing. But with the Queenrsquos consort in his th year there may be calls from some for him to give up motoring.Mr Brandreth said Prince Philip would now most likely stop driving on public roads, though not without ldquomuttering under his breath about it.He said: ldquoIrsquom not sure he would react too well to that, but everyone will be telling him to slow down ndash from his we to the insurers and the Norfolk Constabulary.ldquoHe can afford a chauffeur after all, and indeed the Queen has several on the payroll. Knowing him a little, I donrsquot think hersquos likely to welcome advice to slow down. I mean ndash hersquos only , still walking without a stick, still carriage-driving and still living his le his way.ldquoIrsquom sure this morning, as well as being grateful to have survived, he will be concerned for the other people involved and he will be shaken by this experience and frustrated that after  years of driving hersquos likely now not to be driving outside of the private grounds of Sandringham and Windsor.The Duke is not the first royal to flip a Land Rover.

They first met three-and-a-half years ago after Baird made the Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth.Scorsese was looking for directors to work on his and Mick Jaggerrsquos short-lived HBO drama Vinyl and he tapped Baird to helm one of the episodes. Baird remembers meeting him for the first time and telling him he was the reason he got into film-making.ldquoBy the look on his face you could tell he sort of hears this all the time. He was probably thinking I was going to mention Taxi Driver or Raging Bull or Goodfellas, but then I said that King of Comedy was the one that really got me interested in film-making and he instantly became engaged on a really intense level.ldquoI donrsquot think many people pick that out as one of his best movies.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Colin Clark MP, UK Government Minister Lord Duncan and cllr Gillian Owen at the opening event\"  New centre opened in BalmedieviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"David Cook , Cllr Gwyneth Petrie, Cllr Gillian Owen, Cllr Anne Simpson, Cllr Anne Allan, Cllr Iris Walker and Cllr Anne Stirling \"  , Cllr Gwyneth Petrie, Cllr Gillian Owen, Cllr Anne Simpson, Cllr Anne Allan, Cllr Iris Walker and Cllr Anne Stirling \"  Unit to breathe new le into council services viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"ldquoFrom that moment, he kind of took me under his wing and ever since then, whenever I go to New York I go round to his house and wersquoll have a cup of tea or Irsquoll go to the edit and hersquoll show me stuff from the latest film hersquos been working on. It is like a boyhood dream.Of course, Scorsese is also a walking encyclopaedia of film history, so the fact that Baird has made a film about arguably the greatest cinematic comedy double act of all time must have made him a good person to have in his corner. ldquoHe did mentor me on Stan  Ollie, confirms Baird, who specically sought his technical advice on how to shoot the moviersquos dazzling opening scene: an extended one-take tracking shot following Laurel and Hardy at the peak of their career as they walk through a studio backlot in .ldquoWe only had one day to shoot that because we were in Pinewood and Star Wars had taken all the stages, says Baird. ldquoIt was unbelievable. ldquoWe planned it like a military operation.If the sequence owes something to the cinematic craft of the Copacabana nightclub scene in Scorsesersquos Goodfellas, it also feels like a sly homage to the opening shot of Robert Altmanrsquos Hollywood satire The Player, immediately setting this up as more of a bittersweet look at what happens to movie stars when the glare of the spotlight fades.When Stan  Ollie cuts to  years later, for instance, the protagonists are in a very dferent place.Fondly remembered by the public, but out of step with contemporary tastes, theyrsquore unable to secure even aphone call from producers as they embark on what feels, at first, like a grin-and-bear-it tour of Britainrsquos regional music halls, performing their old routines up and down the country, including in Glasgow, where the Lancashire-born Stan Laurel spent the latter part of his childhood and secured his first professional gig, aged , at the Panopticon.ldquoI didnrsquot really know about Laurelrsquos connection to Scotland until I started doing this film, says Baird, who has fond memories of his own childhood love of watching Laurel and Hardy films on TV in the late s and early s.ldquoTherersquos a picture of me as an eight year-old that my mum still has of me dressed as Stan Laurel at the school fancy dress party, he says.The enduring appeal of Laurel and Hardy is something the filmrsquos melancholic plot zeroes in on and though Reillyrsquos performance is justly winning the lionrsquos share of the acclaim, Cooganrsquos take on Laurel as the quiet, professionally-minded workhorse is perhaps the more relatable.It certainly seems more applicable to Bairdrsquos own career. Having grown up in a fishing town with no family connection to the arts world , he kept his own film-making ambitions secret, moving to London and working in telesales until a friend who worked for a newspaper tipped him off to an entry level job at a production company about to be advertised in the recruitment section.ldquoHe told them there was no space to run it that week and gave me the number. ldquoSo I phoned them up, had an interview, got the job and started the next week, by which point the advert had run and they got  applications.ldquoI know, because I had to st through all the mail!Even now, it still feels like becoming a director was a bit of a pipe dream.ldquoBut I think that made me work a lot harder. I had to. It was either work hard and put everything into it or it was never going to happen. ldquoSo Irsquom glad now, but there were a lot of dark days getting here.Jonrsquos formative years were spent in Peterhead. Educated at the local academy, he worked for his fatherrsquos roofing company and ndash like so many other young loons ndash also worked at the port.He even did work experience at the Buchanie!Despite all this, however, he harboured dferent ambitions ndash he wanted to see his name in lights.In an interview with the Buchanie in , he said: ldquoMy uncle lived in Hampshire and we used to visit him twice a year. On the way we would stop in London and go to a theatre production, usually a musical. My dad used to love musicals. By the age of  Irsquod seen everything ndash you name it Irsquod seen it.ldquoWhen I came out of those theatre productions I had this incredible euphoria. I thought when I was older I want to do something that makes people feel like that. ldquoPeterhead is not a place you can really come from and do that. Itrsquos not achievable.

He has since inspired Scotlands forgotten secondary school pupils to follow in his footsteps via his childrens charity, The Polar Academy.On his , he spoke about his -day adventure to school pupils and organisations across the country.He was also invited to a reception at the Scottish Parliament where he struck up a conversation with the then First Minister, a former school teacher.Craig said: “We discussed the fact that schools hadn’t changed much since I had been a pupil.“There were three groups of children in every school – the elite pupils from good, solid backgrounds the troubled youngsters at the other end of the scale and the forgotten group in the middle – that’s the kids that I really wanted to help.”In training...Bathgate Academy pupils are preparing for their expedition in April, which will cost The Polar Academy #,.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Saturday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Nevertheless, well over  party-goers turned out to sing along with local band CoverCover who played popular hits such as the Proclaimers Im Gonna Be .Thursos Santa Claus decoration in the square looked a bit worse for wear as it fell to the ground in the high winds, with one reveller joking that \"hed had too much mulled wine\".Santa wasnt the only casualty and a few wreaths from the base of the Victory war memorial were blown away as well.Tracey added: \"Well be holding an AGM soon and details of this will go on Facebook page for anyone interested in being a part of future events.\"Wed like to thank all those who volunteered, helping with the litter pick at the end, and the sponsors, as well as everyone who attended.\"In Wick, the heat was on as  revellers braved the wind and gathered around the annual bonfire at the top of Bignold Park.Under the guidance of local man Iain Sutherland ndash who revived the tradition over  years ago with friend Mackie MacDonald after the council had given up on it ndash a ft high conglomeration of discarded Christmas trees, wooden pallets and compressed paper had been built earlier that same day.Looking down from a safe vantage point in his daughter Helens car, Iain said he was proud and \"delighted\" as he watched the bonfire take hold.His son-in-law Mervyn Hill, who runs the Netherclfe Hotel with Helen, had not only learned the fine art of fire-building but had organised for some members of the towns pipe band to bring in  with Hogmanay tunes.\"Its been a successful night and despite the wind we had around  people show up,\" said Mervyn.\"We had people of all ages here.

Work is due to start this year, be completed by spring  and create  jobs during the construction phase.Councillor Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness on Highland Council, said: \"While Im keen to see an improvement to the north brae, I still believe we cant take our focus off the south brae. We have two major long-term concerns to focus on here ndash the gradient of the brae and the fact that we are still witnessing serious accidents on the bottom hairpin bend even where there is an escape bed.\"These accidents are a risk to le, causing road closures and impacting in all sorts of ways on our local community and economy. Improvements to the north brae are very welcome and I hope that it is the start of a bigger vision to improve the entire Berriedale Braes.\"We can expect the standard lead-in period of about three months and for discussions to be held with the contractor on how they propose to physically approach the works and discussions with statutory bodies like the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds among others.\"He said that archaeological investigatory works have been completed.The award of the contract was also welcomed by Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce.She said: \"We are delighted to see that after many years of dedicated campaigning by the chamber, Caithness Transport Forum and other local organisations, this project is finally moving ahead. For too long, the Berriedale Braes has acted as a pinch point for travellers on the A north of Inverness, disrupting business and jeopardising investment in the region.\"It has been good to see other work on A improvements and repairs going to local companies in recent years, and we hope the principal contractor will engage closely with our highly skilled local supply chain as these works progress.\"Ms Morris added: \"Now that the contract has been formally awarded, we hope to see clarication on exact start dates and expectedof works very soon. We would urge the Scottish Government to uphold its previous promise to start works within this financial year so that the north Highlands can start to see the benefit of this upgrade as soon as possible.\"A Transport Scotland spokesman said: \"R J McLeod Ltd has been awarded the construction contract as part of the pound. million project to deliver improvements to the road alignment and the existing tight hairpin bend on the A.\"Michael Matheson, cabinet secretary for transport, hailed it as a positive development for the area. \"It will enhance the skills development of the Scottish construction industry, with approximately  jobs expected to be supported in the region during construction.\"Related articles:Four in running for Berriedale Braes contractSilence on A schemeSaturday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : pmCampaigners working to overturn the conviction of Michael Ross have ruled out any collaboration with true crime author Wensley Clarkson on his book about the case.

Following on from its four other adaptations of children’s classics, as well as pantomimes and avant-garde entries to the SCDA festival, the group has decided to stage a musical version of Arthur Ransome’s well-known book Swallows and Amazons.Developed for the famous Bristol Old Vic theatre, it tells the story of four rather straight-laced children on holiday in the s, given permission, in those pre-risk assessment days, to take a dinghy out onto the lake with their father’s warning not to be “duffers,” in other words, just to be sensible. They soon get their sense of adventure heightened when they meet the fierce Amazon pirates, otherwise the Blackett sisters, Nancy and Peggy. After a brief “battle of the boats” on the lake, they decide to wage another war against the Blacketts’ Uncle Jim, soon to be renamed “Captain Flint,” simply because he has spent the summer writing a boring book and isn’t a fun uncle any more. That, and a mysterious burglary, makes for an exciting, funny and absorbing play, with a surprise at every turn.The story is great fun, all the more so since the production uses a number of clever devices to turn everyday household objects into boats, rocks, weapons and everything  needed to tell the story. The cast, made up of actors ranging in age from  to  plus, have enjoyed creating their characters and learning the very catchy songs with this year#s musical director Glenys Hughes.Soyou want to see how a hall can be turned into a lake without flooding it, Deerness Dram Group encourage you to come along on February ,  or  and join in the fun!

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards.

SSEN say these changes are aimed at improving the security of supply serving one of Orkney#s most remote islands, enhancing network resilience for the local community.The network operator has also installed new automation equipment on the network which allows SSEN’s teams to remotely operate switches, meaning power can be restored much quicker in the event of a power cut by remotely isolating the affected part of the network.Colin Rendall, SSEN’s Orkney Operations Manager, said: “The work on Sanday forms part of an ongoing commitment to target our investment towards improving network reliability in the areas with the greatest potential impact and improvement for our customers. We’re delighted to have completed this project on time and on budget, providing a more resilient, stronger electricity network for our customers on Sanday.“As a responsible network operator, we worked closely with archaeologists and ecologists to ensure all works were completed in a responsible manner, with careful consideration for the local landscape and environment. We’d like to thank the local community for their support and patience during these works.”This work, delivering on one of SSEN’s business commitments, means the main network line serving  properties from Stove to the north end of Sanday has now been upgraded — resulting in a more resilient network for SSEN’s customers living and working on the island.Mobile generation was deployed throughout the duration of the project to minimise disruption to the island community, ensuring schools, shops, hotels and local businesses stayed on supply whilst SSEN’s engineers undertook this essential work.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Therersquos no record showing where this bonnet came from other than what is said on the label and all that says is it was found in a bog at Fort Augustus.ldquoMr Harbord thinks it might be the earliest surviving example and that seems perfectly feasible.

He told the Ross-shire Journal: ldquoThis issue has rumbled on for some time and as the public interest shows, needs resolved quickly. I have written to Highland Councilrsquos director of community services, William Gilfillan, to ask that he attends a meeting with myself and other local community representatives.ldquoI am eager to get the community and the council round the table and thrash out the best way forward for Fighting Macrsquos monument. I have also written to the ward manager to request a site visit so I can see for myself the locally disputed health and safety concerns.More than  people have already signed a petition pressing Highland Council to take action. It states: ldquoThe time for excuses has passed, we have been let down far too often by officials.Its instigator, George Murray, who is leading moves for a business improvement district in the town, said he was delighted but not surprised by the public response.He said: ldquoThe council never understood the monument is more than just a local landmark with a nice view ndash in our area the MacDonald monument is a source of pride. The first man to ever make it from private to general in the history of the British army was a local from the Black Isle and people are proud of that history, why wouldnrsquot they be He said: ldquoWhat that shows is just how big the disconnect between the people and the council really is ndash I suspect its own officials are out of touch with the new chief executive, at least she listens.ldquoPeople are saying how they loved going up there as a child and how good it would be for education ndash the closure has really hurt the town.Dingwall Community Council chairman Jack Shepherd said support for the petition was a good indication of the strength of feeling towards getting the monument reopened.One who signed the petition, Iona McAuley,said: ldquoI used to love visiting the monument every Thursday evening with the Dingwall in Bloom group. I often take my children up to sit at the canons and tell them the story behind it. I have promised one day Irsquoll take them inside ndash hopefully in the near future.Another, Ireneusz Grochowski, said: ldquoIt would be great to see Dingwall from the top of the monument. I think it will be an amazing viewpoint for villagers and tourists.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoThe council has offered a community buyout and are waiting to hearthis is a proposal the group want to progress. We are following the findings of the health and safety report that highlighted a number of issues. Our insurance section has also advised us that the council would be unable to insure the monument for this public kind of use.The petition can be viewed at www.change.org p the-highland-council-open-the-hector-macdonald-monument-to-the-publicWhat do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupSaturday  Jan  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given. It#s been quite a lot of disruption to many of the fishermen andthe rig deviates even a hundred or so metres there is still plenty of opportunity to foul the moved. and now more-densely packed fishing gear but at least in the area where I am working there has been a -plus metre corridor cleared where the advertised track says the rig will be.“No doubt there are some fishermen who are on holiday or who for whatever reason have not had the opportunity to clear all their gear. However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/001WH1101NCA-1.jpg","title":"closure of tarbert ferry service to vehicles unavoidable say","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCalMac’s director of service has  described a planned temporary closure of the linkspan at Tarbert ferry terminal as “unavoidable disruption”.The operator has announced the vehicle service will be out of action for five days across February and March.

This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  . The Samaritans volunteers provide a listening ear,  days per year and you can call them any hour of the day, or night,”If you are able to help out in any small way, by baking a few scones tray bakes or by just coming along to have a cuppa and a scone and to give a donation, the organisers will certainly appreciate your kindness.IN PICTURES: Dromore High opens its doors to prospective pupils Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8770151.1547557159!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"Dromore High School recently welcomed prospective pupils to the school.

P children from Seymour Hill met with Mrs Jess before her birthday and found out more about her le, before sharing the story with the rest of the school.School Principal Mr Stephen Nimmons explained: “During World War Two Mrs Jess worked at a hem stitching factory near Dromore, where she worked on the machines and made fancy patterns around pillow cases and table cloths. “Every day she would have to cycle four miles to work and in the evenings four miles back home – rain, hail or snow. When the war was at its height, the factory started making unorms for the soldiers. From her house in Kinallen, she could see the lights of Belfast light up the sky when the German bombers came.“Just after the war, in , Mrs Jess married and went on to have three daughters. She has been a widow for  years and now has three children, six grandchildren and six great grandchildren. “Mrs Jess came to live in Seymour Hill on February ,  when there were no schools, shops nor churches built on the estate at the time. Seymour Hill Primary School was built by September  when the first pupils started the school. “She started working in the school when it opened in  and she worked in the school for over  years until her retirement.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

In Belfast we have load of Victoria places. A hospital, a shopping mall, a university. We also have a bridge named after Queen Elizabeth. Of course those named venues are not really about the women they are named after. We all know it is about their position, the reign of empire and monarchy.The only other place named after a woman that I am aware of is the Mary Peters’ Track. Unlike the aforementioned, it is hard to view that negatively. Mary earned it the hard way.There are also very, very, few places named after working class heroes. As we walk our streets in West Belfast we walk on the roads named after imperial battles or, less insultingly, places like Donegal. The exception is the Michael Ferguson Roundabout named after the beloved councillor who died too young but had dedicated his short le to the people of Colin.In the s, when standing in the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow, being hosted by Mikail Gorbachev, Mrs Emma Groves was handed a blini with caviar. She turned to the only other woman in attendance from West Belfast, Clara Reilly, and said, “I think I’d prefer a fish supper.” That night at the performance, Clara sat beside her friend Emma, who had no sight but could hear the glorious music, and she described to Emma the intricate costumes and the air-like dancing.Emma Groves and Clara Reilly were not there on a jolly. They were not invited as political favour. They had travelled to Moscow at the height of the Cold War to ask for help for the most forgotten and dismissed of victims of our conflict. They lobbied for Soviet support to end the use of plastic and rubber bullets. In the same breath we can mention a similar visit by these two women to Washington to lobby the other side of Cold War incredibly impressive human rights advocacy that would be recognised more universally had they not been Irish women from West Belfast highlighting British state abuses. Mrs Clara Reilly embodies the spirit of freedom. A spine of steel and a heart of gold. Her story is yet to be written. But she has some of that story still to write.When Emma Groves passed away, she was carried by those who loved her, including Clara, in a willow basket. She epitomised humility. It was no surprise that her final wishes were to contribute to the earth. She gave example to us all.Both women shone a light of humanity in the darkest of days. Despite horric violations of injury and bereavement visited upon them both, they could only think of others who they used their hearts and strength to support and advocate on behalf of. While other human rights advocates on this island looked to South Africa or Nicaragua in safety, these women stood in their own streets and insisted on human rights beginning at home.This weekend Belfast will have a new nameplate.

I worked there for a further two years under the stewardship of Jim Deery, who I owe a lot to. Jim really gave me a foot up when I needed it. I cut my teeth in the back streets of the New Lodge learning about social justice, community development and participative democracy.“I always knew I wanted to work with young people – it’s my passion. In St Malachy’s I spent as many free periods as I could get playing football as opposed to studying – I wanted to do teaching at that time, but I wasn’t really interested in the A-Levels I was doing.“There was always that draw to work with people, young people in particular. My mummy was always heavily involved in the community and volunteering, so I also have that family background.”After six years at the Star, Chris went on to become a Senior Development Officer at the Bytes Project before taking up a post as the Children and Young People’s Coordinator with Belfast City Council, where he helped set up a city youth forum and Belfast’s first skate park.Remarkably, he took up the Director’s role at NIYF just a few years later when he was just  years old. It presented a massive new challenge, which Chris insists he was well prepared to meet, despite his young age.“It was definitely in my DNA,” he said.“It’s about building the capacity of young people to affect positive change.“We always talk about young people being part of the solution as opposed to being the problem, and again I have to pay credit to Jim Deery, he was the one who schooled me in that chain of thought.“All of those people in the Star really heavily influenced my thinking. All of my jobs since leaving school, whether it was in voluntary or paid capacity, had that underbelly. It’s about people making positive change for themselves.“When the job in the Youth Forum came up it was like a dream job, it was allowing me to do something that I had been practising for years, but only on a regional basis.“The role here is very strategic. You’re linked into government, you’re linked into the EU, we’re presenting to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, so we’re doing all of this amazing work internationally as well as locally.“We are working with young people who are on the margins, such as homeless young people, and seeing those young people building their own capacity to affect change in their own lives and communities is amazing.”He continued: “Some days I feel like I should come in with a firefighter’s hat, because you spend an awful lot of time fighting fires and managing mini crises.“A big part of the job is strategising, lobbying and campaigning. I often talk about speaking truth to power, so it’s about bringing the voice of young people to those in a position of power. Sometimes that’s uncomfortable for those in positions of power, because you’re banging down doors to try to affect change for the marginalised people in society. Every day is a battle. You’re fighting a fight for people who are getting the rough end of the stick.”In an ever-changing world, the problems faced by young people have become increasingly complex, and Chris says that many of them are challenges faced by young people the world over. However, he believes that legacy of our recent conflict makes many of our own young people’s challenges unique.“Whether you’re in Belfast, Paris or Sydney, there are massive problems around mental health, drugs, poverty, exclusion and all of these things you can apply to any area,” he said.“The big thing here is the legacy of the past – it’s the lens that magnies all of these problems. I would relate a lot of the reasons our high suicide rates and mental ill-health to the conflict and the legacy of the past. There is a lot we still don’t know we talk about transgenerational trauma. You just need to look out the window and you can see people living with these issues and a lot of it is linked to the conflict. If we don’t deal with legacy and we don’t deal with the conflict then that’s not going to go away.”Despite the magnitude of the task ahead, Chris and the NIYF are relentless in their pursuit of a better society. After serving that eye-opening apprenticeship he now heads one of the largest providers of non-formal education in the country. There is undoubtedly a lesson to be learned from his experience.“I know it’s a cliché, but what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” he said.“Every time you are faced with a challenge it can be a valuable lesson. Again, another cliché, sometimes you learn more in failure than in success. I’m a great believer in ‘Mól an óige agus tiocfaidh sí – praise the youth and they shall prosper’.“In my work le and in my voluntary work teaching kids in sport I try to teach them about work ethic. I try to teach them that hard work beats talent and that talent doesn’t work hard.“The education system as it is set up is designed for maybe  per cent of high achievers, so in my opinion it is failing so many young people. Non-formal education, for us, is about finding that passion. For us it’s about encouraging young people to find the thing that lights the fire in their belly.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"poignant site set to be named after clara and emma","story":"LORD Mayor Deirdre Hargey, along with community leaders, are to attend the unveiling of ‘Groves Reilly Corner’ at the former Andersonstown barracks site in tribute to the late Emma Groves and fellow human rights campaigner Clara Reilly. The renaming of the site, taking place on Saturday, is especially poignant as it is where Emma and Clara stood for decades in protest at human rights abuses and in memory of those fatally injured and killed by plastic bullets. Speaking ahead of the unveiling Relatives For JusticeDirector Mark Thompson said: “What these two women have given our community and achieved is remarkable and as a community, a society, a country, we have been privileged and blessed to have had them there for us all.”Mark added: “And it is this very combination of their work, humanity and humility, which they bring to that very vocation of standing up for rights when and where required that makes them stand out even though they’d be the first to shy away from such public accolades. “Emma Groves and Clara Reilly were also instrumental in establishing Relatives for Justice , our NGO, in April , ensuring that a holistic support and care package, from professional therapeutic counselling support for trauma survivors partnering a rights based advocacy casework approach for addressing human rights violations, framed our work. We stand on the shoulders of giants in the sense that ordinary people both made extraordinary sacrices and did extraordinary work at great personal risk in extraordinary times. “Their motto was simple, in that they paraphrased Edmund Burke, in saying ‘That evil can only flourish when good people remain silent.’ They refused to stay silent,” he said. Paul O’Connor from the Pat Finucane Centre described Emma Groves and Clara Reilly as “two lives of resistance”.“Two women who were leaders in their community –and Clara still is,” said Paul. “Many communities would be lucky to have had one of these indomitable fighters. Belfast and beyond had two but for the saddest of reasons. We say that Emma was ‘blinded by a rubber bullet’ in November  but she was actually blinded by a British soldier, a Para, who deliberately fired a rubber bullet at her face. “There wasn’t even an allegation that she was a phantom gunwoman or nail bomber. She simply refused to turn off the rebel songs she was playing in her own home. At some level the British Government must have regretted that day because Emma Groves went on to campaign, highlight, expose, denounce and bear witness to the dangers posed by rubber and plastic bullets in the following decades.“It is totally appropriate that the site of the former Andersonstown RUC barracks, scene of so many pickets with Emma and Clara, should now be renamed to honour these two strong working class women who did so much for others. “The chattering classes can keep their MBEs and CBEs. Clara and Emma are and were real heroes. And Relatives for Justice is a fitting tribute to all those years of dedication and struggle.”NI Amnesty Programme Director Patrick Corrigan recalled first meeting Emma Groves and Clara in the early s when “in Emma’s living room in Andersonstown, over a cup of tea, she told her harrowing story”.“Wearing her trademark dark glasses, she recounted the day in  when she lost the sight of both eyes after being shot in the face at point-blank range with a rubber bullet. Like so many stories from our recent conflict, Emma Groves’ inidual experience was of one of unwarranted violence and unnecessary pain.Clara Reilly and Emma Groves founded the United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets to bring together families bereaved or injured by rubber and plastic bullets and to end their use here and everywhere.“Campaigning by Emma Groves and Clara Reilly shone a light on the human rights abuses and suffering inflicted through use of the weapons, and inspired many to stand with them. They would later help found Relatives for Justiceand inspire its model of mutual support and advocacy.”Ancient Order of Hibernians’ Sean Pender added: “We are proud to add our voice to recognise Clara Reilly and Emma Groves as the community that they worked so hard and long for dedicates the junction of Falls, Glen and Andersonstown Road in their honour.“These two remarkable women stood strong and never wavered in their quest for justice and peace. The AOH was proud to have honoured Clara with its highest award, the Seán McBride humanitarian award, several years ago in recognition of her long history of civil and human rights work.“It is entirely appropriate that there will be an area that will forever recognise the work of these two great women.”The Groves, Reilly and Livingstone families are lelong friends and played prominent roles in the campaign to ban plastic bullets. Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone said: “It was a pleasure and a privilege to have known Emma and to know Clara. The line of placards on the road beside the barracks was and is a familiar August sight and my family can think of no better place and no better way to celebrate the inspirational lives of two amazing women.” The unveiling of Groves Reilly Corner will take place on Saturday January  at pm."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37725189.ece/b50a8/AUTOCROP/w620h342/east_belfastmission.jpg","title":"belfast charitys disappointment after second burglary in a year","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

One of those families was Rachael Mooney and Kevin Lynch, whose baby, Hope Isabella, who was born at  weeks weighing  grams - she had stopped growing at  weeks.They had picked the name Isabella but when she was born their families said \"we will just have to live in hope and keep up the hope for everyday she is living so Kevin looked at her and said, we are calling her Hope.\"Baby Hope is said to be \"doing well’\" and has just been transferred back to Altnagelvin Hospital. The Dublin-based charity offering a haven for families of sick children was founded by Ade Stack after she lost her son, Hugh. Sadly, Hugh lived for just eight months and for the majority of that time he was cared for in hospital. Through her own experience she noticed families sleeping in waiting rooms, cars or having to travel long distances every day.Ms Stack took it upon herself to establish Hugh’s House so that parents in the same situation would have a place for respite which also allows them to remain close to their child in its time of greatest need.Parents are allowed to stay at Hugh’s House free of charge, it is situated at Belvedere Pl, Mountjoy, in Dublin which is a short five-minute walk to Temple Street Children’s University Hospital.Whilst there, parents are also able to share their own experiences which helps build an important support network at what it a very distressing time.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It’s a place where you’re loved, where you’re cared about, showing that the wider community does care that you’re going through this hard time,” Ms Stack explained.“We depend on the generosity of the people of Ireland, those who say, thank God I will never need that house. Hugh passed away in the August, we never got a cent off the HSE, but we knew the need was there so we actually opened the Spring after he died. The first Mother’s Day after Hugh died was spent hoovering the stairs.“We all expect to lose people in our lives but when you lose a child it’s really hard because it feels unnatural. But this feels really natural, it feels like we just made a little herd and the love of all the people who helped us in the house, all of the rooms have been adopted by families who lost a child, and I hope all of that love is present in the house, and people feel loved and cared for and wanted.”At the house volunteers cook meals for families and there is a play area for young children who may be visiting their sick siblings.Local Independent Councillor, Gary Donnelly, became aware of the charity recently in his role as a community representative. He has now encouraged the public to register to take part and support fundraising efforts tomorrow. “I became aware of Hugh’s House recently when I was looking for help for a local family and I am aware that a number of families from Derry have recently availed of the service. “Creggan Community Collective will be holding a fundraiser on behalf of Hugh’s House Dublin. We will be doing a sponsored Spin Cycle beginning at am on Friday th January. The cycle will cover the distance of  miles the distance from Derry to Dublin. Recently a number of Derry families have availed of the invaluable service provided by Hugh’s House and all money raised will go to this worthwhile cause.”If you would like to help out with this event by taking part please contact the Creggan Community Collective on .Photo shows parents Rachael Mooney and Kevin Lynch with baby Hope."},{"url":null,"title":"result weeks foyle hospice prize draw winner","story":"Winners in this weeks Foyle Hospice Prize Draw are - £,, Marion Boyle£, Lara Dingley£, Mary Agnes McCormack£, Grainne Shaw£, Issam Horshi .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"worlds largest collection famine art open derrys creative quarter","story":"Coming Home: Art and the Great Hunger, the acclaimed famine-related art exhibition, will officially launch at Cultúrlann Uí Chanáin in Derry tomorrow. The launch will be attended by Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr.

We could all learn so much from him.Cllr Walker said he hoped those who targeted Ryanrsquos cookie box would realise the error of their ways and stop again outside the young manrsquos home to pay for the food they took.ldquoWhat happened in the dead of night outside Ryanrsquos home is a sad reflection on those responsible. If they do not pay for the goods. I hope they can be identied so the authorities can have a word, he continued.Cllr Walker, who, along with his Rowallane counterpart Terry Andrews, organises several charity events each year, hopes that his  itinerary will allow him to raise some for Ryan which he can donate to a charity of his choice.He added: ldquoRyan is a shining example to us all. He works hard to help others and it is deeply upsetting that there are those in the community who would target of all things an honesty box.

The group of Independent councillors have held the balance of power on council and can swing the vote on issues vital to our community.Cllr Enright said there was a long tradition of Independent and environmentally-minded candidates winning one of the five seats in the Downpatrick and Lecale electoral area.He pointed to Independent hospital candidate, Raymond Blaney, who won a seat on the former Down Council almost  years ago, and the Green Partyrsquos Bill Corry winning a seat in .ldquoIn the  elections, Raymond nominated Bill and I acted as his election agent, while in the  and  elections, both Raymond and Bill supported my successful election campaigns, explained Cllr Enright.ldquoBoth ex-councillors will be active on my behalf for this Mayrsquos election and Bill is my election agent.Cllr Enright said at the  election to the new Newry, Mourne and Down Council, ldquoa remarkable coalition of activists from community organisations, the farming community and the environmental sector backed him to win the fourth of five seats, with an all time high of first preference votes for an independent candidate in the Downpatrick DEA.He believes the fact that he is one of the few local politicians who works full-time as a councillor has helped his support base in an area where he continues to work closely with community organisations in villages and in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Family’s plea to change organ donation system  ","story":"THE family of a Downpatrick man who died before he could get a heart transplant hope that an opt-out organ donation system will be soon introduced to Northern Ireland.Tommy McManusrsquos sister has revealed that even in their grief, the family honoured his commitment to organ donation by giving the  year-oldrsquos corneas so that someone  may see one day.Roisin Taggart said that she believes a system where people choose to opt out of donating their organs in the event of the death will increase the number of organs available.The current situation in Northern Ireland, as opposed to Scotland and Wales, is that people who do not wish to donate their organs have to opt-out by registering their details. England is to introduce an opt-out system in .Mrs Taggart said: ldquoWe need to talk about the people who have lost their battle for an organ. We need to put faces to these tragedies and we all need to make sure our families know about our wishes.Mr McManus was buried last Thursday in his home town after he died from multiple organ failure at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle Upon Tyne on December .Despite being put on a ldquosuper-urgent transplant list just days before Christmas, he succumbed to his illness as he waited for a suitable heart to become available.A successful mechanical engineer who travelled the world with his career, Mr McManus became seriously ill in .After six months of investigations, doctors diagnosed that Mr McManus had suffered cardiac arrest.A heart transplant was ruled out as he was too ill at the time, but doctors did all they could for him by fitting a mechanical pump in anticipation of a new heart.Despite being born with a congenital heart defect known as Transposition of the Great Arteries, the former De La Salle High School student had already defied the odds to live a normal le up until then.Raised in the Colmcille Road area of Downpatrick, Mr McManus ed home to be close to his father Tom mdash his mother Colette had passed away earlier mdash sisters Lisa and Roisin and their families.While he waited on the standard transplant list for three years, Mrs Taggart said that her brother bore his illness well.ldquoTommy was unable to work or travel and relied heavily on us for basic day to day things like shopping, cleaning, etc, she said.ldquoHis mobility was extremely limited through fear of over-exertion. Still, he did everything he could to aid his recovery.Tommy and his family were so thankful to the medical team at the Freeman Hospital for saving his le in  that they raised over pound, in order ldquoto pay back the care they had received.Mrs Taggart says that her family know that the doctors ldquodid absolutely everything in their power to keep Tommy alive and had promised that he would have had his heart transplant before Christmas.ldquoThere is a typical wait of between - days for a heart and we just donrsquot know why one didnrsquot become available. But it didnrsquot and his lungs and kidneys began to fail as a consequence of his heart failure, said Mrs Taggart.Despite the efforts of the ldquophenomenal medical team, Tommy required dialysis and ventilation to keep him alive.The medical team were unable to get him breathing on his own again and he was taken off the transplant list.ldquoWe had seen Tommy go through some much and come out of the other side that it never crossed our minds that he wouldnrsquot get a heart, said Mrs Taggart.She and her family now know from personal experience just how hard it is to make a decision to donate a loved onersquos organs.ldquoDue to Tommyrsquos condition, he was only eligible to donate his corneas, she explained.ldquoWhen we were approached about this, my fatherrsquos immediate reaction was, lsquoNo, hersquos been cut into enoughrsquo, despite the fact that Tommy campaigned so passionately about organ donation, and we all knew his wishes.ldquoThankfully myself and my sister were able to be Tommyrsquos voice, and he was able to give one final and very precious gt to someone.ldquoWe desperately hope that the subject of organ donation can be normalised, and that a change in legislation and attitude is seen very soon. We are just so sorry that this change will come too late for Tommy.Mrs Taggart paid a loving tribute to her only brother: ldquoTommy was a fiercely independent, successful and outgoing young man. He was extremely intelligent, loved technology and was a fountain of knowledge.ldquoNo matter where he travelled, he made friends instantly.Mr McManus is survived by his father, sisters, brothers-in-law Bryon and Kieran, nephews Daniel, Paul and Matthew, nieces Emma and Erin, great-nephews Jay and Donal and great-nieces Chloe and Freya.bull To join the NHS organ donation register, go to www.organdonation.nhs.uk.register-your-details.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Finnebrogue to create 90 new jobs with new food ranges  ","story":"THE success of innovative Downpatrick firm Finnebrogue Artisan is set to continue with the opening of a new ultra-modern poundm vegan and vegetarian factory.The latest signicant investment by the award winning company mdash which is one of the districtrsquos leading employers mdash will support  new jobs with the new facility capable of turning over poundm a year.The latest investment by the company is in response to increasing demand for vegetarian and vegan alternatives, with the ersication illustrating the firmrsquos willingness to respond to changing trends across the food industry.The artisan food producer, which has revolutionised the bacon and ham market in the past  months by launching the first mass-produced nitrite-free alternatives, has invested poundm as it looks to step up its meat-free offerings.Finnebrogue has been producing vegetarian and vegan products for three years, but the opening of a brand new factory marks a signicant up-scaling of the firmrsquos meat-free production.The companyrsquos managing director, Brian McMonagle, said Finnebrogue prided itself on providing consumers with ldquodelicious, innovative products.ldquoGiven the increasing demand for vegan and vegetarian alternatives, this new factory was the obvious next step in our extraordinary growth, he continued.ldquoWe are determined not to stand still and are always looking to make food the best it can possibly be, without being bound by the way itrsquos always been done. More and more people are switching to a vegan or vegetarian diet and even meat eaters are increasingly seeking a day or two off a week.Mr McMonagle added: ldquoAlongside the opening of our new factory, our new product development team is doing extensive work to make some of the tastiest meat-free products on the market.The Downpatrick firm is one of the fastest growing food manufacturers in the Province, with its turnover catapulting from just poundm in  to close to poundm in the current financial year.In addition to its soaring sausage business and ground-breaking Naked Bacon and Naked Ham, the firm is a top supplier of venison and wagyu beef to many leading retailers..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 9%2C 1979  ","story":"SNOW mdash Heavy snow blizzards lashed the locality this week and weathermen say that yet more snow could fall before week is over.Downpatrick and coastal areas from Strangford through to Newcastle escaped the worst of the snow, but Carryduff, Comber, Ballynahinch, Dromara, Saintfield and Ballygowan were not so lucky.However, many parts of the district, including Downpatrick, were thrown into darkness when a transformer in Killyleagh caught fire. An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall. Dromara got it bad yet again and Comber reported several inches.The Department of the Environmentrsquos snow ploughs were in use at Carryduff, Ballynahinch and Dromara, and gritting machines were needed on many local roads.In Downpatrick and coastal districts there was sleet and heavy rain mdash and roads were made treacherous when this turned to ice yesterday morning. There was a spate of minor accidents as cars slithered through the snow and ice.Roads are being gritted by the DOE, but owing to decreasing fuel and salt they have only been treating priority roads.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar is taking part in an appeal organised by the BBC programme Blue Peter, which will help provide bicycles for villages in Africa.The campaign, which involves the collection of stamps on Christmas card envelopes, is already well underway and these will be sold to buy bicycles which will help with transporting medical aid in remote African villages.Anyone in the Crossgar area who wants to help with appeal can leave their contributions at the Post Office.DOWNPATRICK mdash Representatives of Downpatrick organisations are asked to turn their backs on the wintry weather and go to the townrsquos library for a public meeting to consider plans for a major Maytime festival.A steering committee, which was born out of ideas kicked around by Down Councilrsquos arts committee more than a year ago, will present good thinking on how a wholehearted three-day festival of family fun will put the town in holiday form as never before.The centrepiece of the holiday weekend will be a pageant with a Patrician theme and possibly a medieval type flavour.

That is absolutely true of the Downe. First class facilities are nothing without first class staff and at the Downe we are very lucky to have both, she said.Mrs Hanlon remarked: ldquoHospital staff are clearly eager to embrace the challenge of expanding services and I have no doubt that in the years to come the Downersquos reputation as a first class facility with passionate, professional staff will see services grow and develop further..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Head blasts at ‘disparity’ over student allocations  ","story":"A GRAMMAR school principal has hit out at education chiefs for not equally planning for an expected increase for post-primary students.Peter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, says that the Department of Educationhas addressed the need for additional students in Belfast, Bangor and Londonderry by awarding some schools additional places, but has failed to address the local need for  .He has accused DENI of treating some areas in Northern Ireland dferently to others and has urged the Department to address the local problem sooner rather than later.ldquoWe know that this is a major issue waiting to happen, said Mr Dobbin.ldquoStatistics clearly show that there is a signicant number of extra girls to be accommodated across our vast catchment area and I will be left with very angry parents and pupils who are extremely unhappy with not being allocated Assumption Grammar as their preferred choice.ldquoThis would be understandableall schools in all areas were being treated the same, but this is not the case.ldquoHow can some areas be addressed proactively and then other areas neglected  This disparity and the disrespect towards the parents and children in our local area, compared to other areas, is appalling.Statistics from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency show that an increase of an average of  children in this age group in the Down district annually over the next ten years.However, last night a DENI spokesperson said that it had reviewed the anticipated shortfall and that no additional places for next year were needed in Ballynahinch.ldquoAt the end of the admissions procedure in ,  places remained available in Ballynahinch,  of which were in the denominational sector.

The paper said the issue of a Norway-style deal has been raised in meetings between the DUP and senior government ministers as part of attempts to break the Brexit impasse. One DUP MP is quoted as saying: “Our priority is to try and get the current withdrawal agreement altered but we recognise given the scale of the defeat this week that reviving it will be a challenge.“If that cannot be done, we are going to have to look at other options and that could include a softer Brexit as long as it applied to the whole of the United Kingdom. We are open to discussions to try and find a way forward as long as it respects Northern Ireland as an integral part of the UK.”The Times quoted another “senior DUP source” as saying: “If we are looking at a solution that encompasses the whole of the UK that would tick the unionist box.”In a statement this morning, Mrs Foster said the report was “no doubt designed to undermine efforts to get the necessary changes to the withdrawal agreement”.She added: “The Prime Minister is very clear on our position. We have been consistent that for us it is the backstop which needs to be dealt with.“For the future we want an agreement which s control of our money, our laws and our borders through a UK wide free trade arrangement with the EU.“The story in the Times is an attempt to cause ision.

Any deal which requires the backstop is not going to be considered by us.”He also said he was opposed to the prospect of the UK remaining within a customs union with Brussels, adding: “What is the point of leaving the EUwe can’t negotiate our own trade deals ”On Wednesday, DUP MP Jim Shannon told this paper that his party would be open to considering a two-year time-limit on the backstop, provided it was written into the withdrawal agreement.try catch  TrendingN.I. issued with severe weather warning - ice and wintry showers due in next  hoursN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownN.I. snow to arrive tonight and tomorrow - subzero temperatures to reach as low as -degCEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes falls          ..

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
