A study carried out by Essity in the past year found that incontinence was seen as even more difficult to discuss than depression. Many doctors speak of male patients using their wives’ sanitary pads so they don’t end up with a soggy pair of boxers, or staying indoors due to “bladder leash” – the fear of not being able to locate a loo when leaving the house. When is male incontinence most likely to strike?There are different types of incontinence, with men most likely to experience “urge incontinence”. If you’ve ever felt a strong, unexplained impulse to pee, but find you’ve only got a few seconds to sprint to the bathroom, it’s probably urge incontinence. That’s why some men suffer “latchkey incontinence”, the sensation that the floodgates are about to open the moment you twist the key in your front door. Our internal plumbing is usually to blame for leakage, particularly overactive detrusor muscles. When these muscles contract too often (perhaps because you’ve had too much alcohol, too few fluids or even because you’re constipated), it can result in an uncontrollable urge to urinate at unforeseen moments, such as when you hear running water. Other factors that may make it harder to avoid dampness down under include being overweight or having had surgery for prostate cancer, which can result in weakened muscles. Men are also likely to experience post-micturition dribble, which causes a map-like stain to form on underpants after urinating. It’s often down to weakened pelvic floor muscles. What other types of incontinence are there?Men can also experience stress incontinence. That’s not “stress” as in feeling overwhelmed by a bulging inbox, but “stress” as in pressure. It happens when the bladder is put under sudden strain, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing or lifting weights in the gym, all of which can cause urine to leak, possibly because the pelvic floor muscles are weak. Incontinence can also be caused by overflow incontinence (also known as chronic urinary retention). This is when the bladder doesn’t entirely empty, resulting in a man passing small trickles of urine regularly, along with a feeling that the bladder is constantly full. How can I manage my incontinence so I can lead a normal life again?For starters, go and get a checkup with your GP to help you find out the cause. A trip to your GP may result in you being prescribed a course of antibiotics, or given advice on how lifestyle choices (see below) could alleviate symptoms. Until that’s addressed, and any changes kick in, many men have found the easiest way to manage their urine leakage is by using incontinence products, which allow them to enjoy the social activities they did before. Unsure where to start? Try TENA’s free Keep Control sample pack, which arrives discreetly packaged and allows you to road-test the incontinence tech that works best for you. This could be absorbent protective pads or underpants that look just like normal boxer shorts but keep nether regions dry. What else can I do to prevent bladder attacks?Not gulping down endless cups of tea and coffee during your working day can help, as caffeine is a diuretic that can increase the amount of urine you make. That said, it’s important to drink enough fluids so try to sip plenty of water throughout the day. Eating a healthy diet and keeping to a good weight is also beneficial, as being overweight puts pressure on the bladder. And don’t forget the pelvic floor, the muscles that hold the bladder and rectum in place. Men have less active pelvic floors than women so any exercises that strengthen them, such as pilates, are great.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Joe O ShaughnessyChildren across the State are struggling to access early intervention disability services, according to concerned families who feel their children have been “left behind” by the HSE.Early intervention is a systematic programme of therapy, exercises and activities for children with disabilities.During the first wave of Covid-19, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists who worked for the HSE’s local early intervention teams were redeployed.Families say this has left the services in disarray, with many struggling to get vital therapies for their children.Barry Sheridan, CEO of Down Syndrome Ireland, says the organisation is hearing from hundreds of parents whose children are receiving “little or no” early intervention therapies.However, he says the problem pre-dates the Covid pandemic.“Before the pandemic, we surveyed families to find out how many speech and language therapy sessions they were offered in 2019. The average was five sessions in a whole year.”Mr Sheridan added the situation has significantly worsened over the past year due to redeployment.“Most of the evidence-based interventions need four to five sessions per week. Even once a week would be a huge improvement.”Tilly Higgins, from Caltra in Galway, is two-years-old. She has never received any physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, or occupational therapy from the HSE early intervention team.Her mother, Aisling, says Tilly did receive support from an early intervention nurse. “She was amazing. But then Covid hit and there was nothing. Just silence.”RedeployedDuring the first lockdown, the HSE sent a letter to the family, saying the early intervention therapists were redeployed. “It said we would be contacted in due course.”At this stage, Tilly’s parents were trying to help her crawl and stand up, but she had yet to receive any physiotherapy.They asked other parents for advice and Googled resources, but Ms Higgins says while they tried their best, they are not qualified professionals.Ms Higgins then connected Down Syndrome Ireland (DSI), who put her in touch with their early years specialist. “Only for her, I would have crawled into a corner at times, it’s so lonely and isolating when the supports aren’t there.”Around Christmas, Tilly began to get frustrated and angry. Ms Higgins believes this was because she couldn’t express herself. “The DSI Galway branch organised a family Lámh sign course, we paid for that ourselves.”This enabled Tilly to communicate with the rest of her family. “She can let us know when she’s hungry, when she wants play or to have a bath, she’s back to her happy self.”By the time Tilly turned two, Ms Higgins just “broke down”. “I was worried for her future. She’s two, she never had any physio, speech and language, occupational therapy.“How will she be able to keep up with her peers, and to make friends?”Ms Higgins contacted the HSE Early Intervention Team to raise her concerns. Over a month ago, she got an email saying a request for speech and language therapy had been made.Recently, Tilly’s early intervention nurse visited her, and she said she would try to organise a physio and speech and language assessment.‘Will it ever happen?’However, Tilly has received no appointment date yet.“It’s like chasing a pot of gold and the end of the rainbow . . . will it ever happen? Even if we get an appointment, is it just one appointment and then nothing?” she asks.She believes with the right support, Tilly can really thrive. “She can soak anything up, she’s so bright.”In a statement, the HSE said that while children’s disability services were initially stepped down in March 2020, services continued for children with high prioritised needs, with infection prevention controls in place.“Furthermore, children’s disability services have continued to provide services despite the challenges encountered since the HSE cyber-attack on May 14th.”The HSE added that it was “fully cognisant” of the stress caused to families due to waiting times.It added that service improvements are being rolled out. “Children’s Disability Network Teams are being established to provide services and supports for all children with complex needs within a defined geographic area.”These teams will include occupational therapists, psychologists, nurses, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, social workers and others.“Once all teams are in place, every child with complex needs will have access to a team, regardless of the nature of their disability, where they live, or the school they attend.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"poots accuses eu of using north as a plaything","story":"DUP leader Edwin Poots has accused the European Commission of doing demonstrable harm to the peace process in Northern Ireland with the implementation of the Brexit protocol.

Photograph: Rebecca BlackPA WireDUP leader Edwin Poots has accused the EU for using Northern Ireland as a “plaything” over Brexit. He also accused the EU of doing “demonstrable harm” to the peace process and said he is concerned of violence this summer due to anger over the Northern Ireland protocol.Appearing on BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Poots said once the grace periods on post-Brexit checks on goods from Britain ends, there will be 15,000 checks per week at the region’s ports — more, he said, than take place in Rotterdam, Europe’s biggest port.“We really need to ditch the protocol and ditch these checks because they are hugely damaging to the lowest paid workers,” he said.Mr Poots said although the European Commission over the years “put their heart and soul into winning peace in Northern Ireland”, they currently “don’t seem to care for the peace process . . . that really needs to change, that attitude needs to change, they are doing demonstrable harm to every inidual in Northern Ireland and it is having a devastating impact”.He said the UK government had the grounds to trigger Article 16 due to economic and societal damage, which he described as “very evident”.“This is the European Union seeking to punish the United Kingdom. As a consequence, Northern Ireland is being used as a plaything for the European Union,” the new DUP leader said.“I can assure you Northern Ireland should be nobody’s plaything, we are citizens of the United Kingdom, we were citizens of the European Union and we deserve to be treated with the same respect as everyone else.”Also appearing on the BBC programme, European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic rejected Edwin Poots’ ‘plaything’ accusation.“We really do our utmost to make sure we demonstrate our total commitment to the Good FridayBelfast Agreement and therefore we’ve been looking for the four years for the best solution to the very sensitive situation in Northern Ireland,” he said.“For us, and not only for us but also for the UK Government, the response was very clear that it was the protocol,” he said.“I think that now, what we should do is to focus on the policies and politics that rather unite than ide us.Mr Sefcovic said he wants to meet the Northern Ireland Executive parties before the next joint committee, which is expected to take place in the middle of June.“I would like to hear from Mr Poots himself but also from other leaders of the political parties who form the Northern Ireland Executive, and discuss with them what we can do better,” he said. – PA How is Brexit affecting you?

File photograph: Manan VatsyayanaAFP via GettyScientists in Vietnam have discovered a new coronavirus variant that is a hybrid of strains first found in India and the UK, the country’s health minister has said.Nguyen Thanh Long said scientists examined the genetic make-up of the virus that had infected some recent patients, and found the new version of the virus.He said lab tests suggested it might spread more easily than other versions of the virus.Viruses often develop small genetic changes as they reproduce, and new variants of the coronavirus have been seen almost since it was first detected in China in late 2019.The World Health Organisation has listed four global “variants of concern” – the two first found in the UK and India, plus ones identified in South Africa and Brazil. Mr Long said the new variant could be responsible for a recent surge in Vietnam, which has spread to 30 of the country’s 63 municipalities and provinces.Vietnam was initially a standout success in battling the virus – in early May, it had recorded just over 3,100 confirmed cases and 35 deaths since the start of the pandemic.But in the last few weeks, Vietnam has confirmed more than 3,500 new cases and 12 deaths, increasing the country’s total death toll to 47.Most of the new transmissions were found in Bac Ninh and Bac Giang, two provinces dense with industrial zones where hundreds of thousands of people work for major companies including Samsung, Canon and Luxshare, a partner in assembling Apple products.Church clusterDespite strict health regulations, a company in Bac Giang discovered that one fifth of its 4,800 workers had tested positive for the virus.In Ho Chi Minh City, the country’s largest metropolis with a population of nine million, at least 85 people have tested positive as part of a cluster at a Protestant church, the health ministry said.Worshippers sang and chanted while sitting close together without wearing proper masks or taking other precautions.Vietnam has since ordered a nationwide ban on all religious events.In major cities, authorities have banned large gatherings, closed public parks and non-essential business including in-person restaurants, bars, clubs and spas.Vietnam so far has vaccinated one million people with AstraZeneca jabs.Last week, the government sealed a deal with Pfizer for 30 million doses, which are scheduled to be delivered in the third and fourth quarters of this year.It is also in talks with Moderna which would give it enough jabs to fully vaccine 80 per cent of its 96 million people. – APEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"what is the eu digital covid certificate","story":"While the digital Covid certificate  system  is set for formal launch on July 1st, Greece has announced  it is ready to use the system earlier as it is keen to start its summer tourism season. Photograph: Getty ImagesWhat is the EU digital Covid certificate?The digital Covid certificate is aimed to help EU residents demonstrate whether they have been vaccinated when travelling within the bloc. The system has been developed at the insistence of member states that are economically reliant on tourism in the hope it will help to ease travel restrictions.How will the system work?The free certificate will be a scannable QR code that travellers can show on a piece of paper or on their phones, similar to the airport boarding passes familiar from pre-pandemic times.It is designed to include people who have not been vaccinated as well: it can also show if you have tested negative for Covid-19 or if you have had the illness and recovered.The certificate is not mandatory for travellers. It remains up to each member state to set their own Covid-19 health policies, and therefore to choose whether to treat vaccinated people that arrive in their country differently to non-vaccinated people.Some countries will choose to exempt vaccinated people from requirements such as to undergo a Covid-19 test or quarantine, particularly if they want to attract tourists. Some EU countries have begun to already exempt vaccinated arrivals from restrictions, including Croatia, Greece, and from June 7th, Spain. People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their final dose.When will it go live?The system is currently being trialled, and is set for formal launch on July 1st, though countries can choose to link in later. Greece has announced that it is ready to use the system earlier as it is keen to start its summer tourism season. Ireland is to join on July 19th.In order to link up to the system national healthcare systems must collect vaccination data in a standard format so that they can issue the certificates for their residents.The data that the certificates must contain includes name, date of birth, date of issuance, date of vaccine received, test or recovery from Covid-19, and a unique identifier.The information is not stored in a central EU database, but remains kept in each country’s national healthcare system. The digital architecture the EU has built essentially provides a way for this data to be presented in a code that can be read and understood in any of the 27 countries when travellers arrive.The vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency (AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson) are automatically accepted. Member states can choose to also accept vaccines that are not approved by the European Medicines Agency. Some of these have been used within the EU, such as Russia’s Sputnik and China’s Sinopharm in Hungary. What about travel beyond the EU?The European Commission says it is “working with the World Health Organisation to ensure that certificates issued in the EU can be recognised elsewhere in the world as well”.What about Northern Ireland?The State’s HSE has the responsibility of issuing Covid-19 digital vaccination certificates for residents of the Republic. Eligibility for vaccination throughout the EU is generally linked to where you have a social insurance or healthcare number, in Ireland’s case a PPS number.The European Commission has said that countries outside the EU could choose to join the system but this appears to be unlikely in the case of the UK. That means it will be up to each member state to set policy on how to treat travellers who have been vaccinated through the UK National Health Service.NHS England has a Covid app that can be used as a certificate: cabinet minister Michael Gove announced this week that the countries that have agreed to accept as proof of vaccination now include Barbados, Croatia, Greece, Turkey, Gibraltar, Iceland, Moldova, Bulgaria, and Estonia. Northern Ireland’s Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride told journalists this week that work on a version for residents in the North was “developing very quickly” and would initially be a paper system before moving to a digital format. “We hope to be in a position to announce that some time in July,” he told The News Letter.

Photograph: JACK GUEZAFP via Getty ImagesIsraeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu on Sunday sought to try to dissuade opponents from forming a “government of change” as media reports say a deal to unseat Israel’s longest-serving leader could be imminent.A mandate for opposition chief Yair Lapid to put together a coalition after four inconclusive elections in two years, expires on Wednesday. Israeli media said Mr Lapid was closing in on an alliance of right-wing, centrist and leftist parties.His chances of success rest largely with far-right politician Naftali Bennett, a kingmaker whose Yamina party has six key seats in parliament.Mr Bennett (49) was widely expected to announce whether he would team up with Mr Lapid, who heads the centrist Yesh Atid party. Israeli media reports largely predicted Mr Bennett would agree to the partnership.But first, Mr Bennett would have to rally his own party’s legislators behind joining what right-winger Mr Netanyahu’s opponents have described as a government of “change” comprising factions from the left, centre and right.Still short of a parliamentary majority after a March 23rd election that ended in stalemate, such a erse grouping could be fragile, and require outside backing by Arab members of parliament whose political views differ sharply from those of the Yamina party.Mr Bennett has maintained public silence in recent days, but Israeli political commentators largely predicted he would opt for a partnership with Mr Lapid. Faced with a possible deal, Mr Netanyahu made a sudden counter-offer on Sunday that would entail a break in the prime minister’s 12 consecutive years in office.In a proposal he signed along with leaders of parties in his current coalition, Mr Netanyahu offered to go second in a “triple rotation” of the premiership of a right-wing government.Under the blueprint, published by a Likud spokesman, Gideon Saar, head of the rightist New Horizon party, would become prime minister for 15 months, followed by Mr Netanyahu for two years and then Mr Bennett for an unspecified “remainder of its term”.However, Mr Saar, a former Likud cabinet minister, swiftly rejected the offer, writing on Twitter: “Our position and commitment are unchanged - to end Netanyahu’s rule.” – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: British spies say Wuhan lab leak is \u0026#39feasible\u0026#39Carrie Symonds to become Mrs Johnson after agreeing to take Boris\u0026#39s surnameThe hardline cleric being groomed to become president – and the Supreme Leader of IranChelsea graffiti appears on Winston Churchill statue at Parliament Square after Champions League winComment: Life begins when you don’t give a stuff about your sizeBoris Johnson and Carrie Symonds married in secret wedding ceremony at Westminster CathedralComment: Don’t believe the scare stories –Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds wed in secret ceremony: how the UK reacted to their marriageBoris Johnson wedding: How did Prime Minister marry Carrie Symonds in a Catholic church?Covid lockdown roadmap: the latest rules and news on June 21 reopeningWho is next on the list for Covid vaccines - and how will I be invited to book an appointment?Gavin Williamson: Pupils should not have to ‘run gauntlet of protests’ at school gatesComment: Around the world, the pandemic has fuelled a new authoritarianismNew Yorkers demand right to carry hidden guns as America reels from bloody week of mass shootingsTake it from me, the giant insects swarming Washington DC don\u0026#39t taste that badIndian variant Q\u0026ampA: are the symptoms different, and do vaccines protect against it? Sunday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Could severe ‘space weather’ pose the next major threat to our way of life?Bill Browder: Why I never fly over  Russian airspace – and nor should youAutomated spacecraft docks with China\u0026#39s new space stationBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bulldogs pugs struggling reach old age suggests research","story":"Bulldogs and pugs, beloved for their flat faces but notorious for their health issues, are the most likely dog breeds to struggle to reach old age, new research suggests.Researchers from the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) analysed data from nearly a million dogs in the UK, and assessed how common it was for a dog to be euthanised.A total of 18 breeds were included in the study, and all were compared to a Labrador. The study, published in Scientific Reports, revealed Rottweilers are 76 per cent more likely to be put down than a lab.However, the odds of a bulldog or pug being put to sleep are a third and a half as much as a Labrador, respectively.“We put some ideas and theories forward as to why but it is difficult to be conclusive,” Dr Camilla Peygrem, companion animal epidemiologist at the RVC, and lead author of the study, told The .But one possible explanation is that the small, snorty lap dogs, known as brachycephalic breeds, form particularly strong connections with their owners, which may make it harder for them to put them to sleep.This is exacerbated, experts say, by the fact any debilitating health issues are easier to overcome for owners than they would be in a larger dog.“If you have a big dog it is much harder to manage as an owner than if you have a chihuahua,” Dr Daniella Dos Santos, senior vice-president at the British Veterinary Association, and a small animal and exotics vet, who was not involved with the research, told The .“Rottweilers were top of the table for risk of euthanasia, but it is not because it is a Rotty but because it is a bigger dog and owners find it harder to cope as they age.“If you imagine a dog with a spinal cord disorder, if it needs help moving it is much harder to move a 30kg dog than a 2kg dog.”Dr O’Neill, a co-author of the study who is also a senior lecturer in companion animal epidemiology at RVC, and also chair of the Brachycephalic Working Group, said Britain is in the midst of a “flat-faced dog crisis”.Dr O’Neill adds that ongoing work shows English Bulldogs and pugs have different common causes of death to other breeds, and this may partially explain the statistics.“The core message here is that English bulldogs and pugs do differ to other breeds in how they typically die, and this is yet another piece of evidence showing how different these extreme flat-faced breeds are to other types of dogs.”Official figures show that since the year 2000, there has been a 17,198 per cent increase in the number of registered French bulldog puppies, another brachycephalic breed.Bulldogs and pugs have seen a 488 and 601 per cent increase in popularity in 20 years, respectively.“The rise in numbers has been influenced by social media and celebrity influence,” Dr Dos Santos said.“We see flat faces as cute and are normalising bulging eyes and skin creases which need cleaning. We are seeing it as normal to snore and for them to make noises when breathing, but it is not normal at all.“We should not be normalising obesity and not going for a walk, for example. It is an emotive subject, people have these dogs, they love these dogs and they are cherished family pets.“But if you love these breeds, you shouldn\u0027t get them. As the demand continues there will be unscrupulous breeders exploiting these dogs and it will lead to a health and welfare disaster.“With the popularity increase, we are seeing these dogs more often, and we as vets are seeing the harsh realities of their health issues.“We are treating the dogs when they can\u0027t breath, when they get heatstroke, and when they lose an eye from a corneal ulcer.“They are prone to heat stroke and have challenges in breathing, and panting is how dogs release heat.

It is expected to reopen in the summer of 2023.The new owners of Stoke Park, Reliance Industries Limited, are making a major investment into the estate and are committed to preserving Stoke Park\u0027s rich heritage, a club spokesman said, explaining how the club\u0027s fifth owner had a responsibility to future proof the business.The closure will also temporarily scupper the Boodles Challenge, an  international five-day tennis exhibition which is held in the week before Wimbledon and has seen players such as Tim Henman and Novak Djokovic compete.The club\u0027s 160 staff will be scaled down, with those leaving being properly compensated for their dedicated service, the spokesman added.Sean Connery was filmed on the course in 1964, playing golf as 007 against Auric Goldfinger with his henchman Oddjob, who later decapitates a statue with his chakram-loaded bowler hat.Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Renee Zellweger were filmed in the grounds and The Pennsylvania Suite for the 2001 film Bridget Jones\u0027s Diary.The park has also featured in The Crown.Members, who pay more than £4,000 a year in membership fees, expressed disgust that the club is closing so soon after reopening. They fear the clubhouse could become Mr Ambani’s private residence.Des Folliard, a former club golf captain who has played there for 23 years, said: It\u0027s all up in the air. There\u0027s talk of it being made into a private residence. A lot of the golf clubs in the UK are being bought over by very rich people from abroad – it\u0027s strange.Phil Slater, 45, from Ealing, London, added: A lot of rich people just want their personal plaything. He\u0027ll probably come over here for a couple of months a year and have the golf course to himself.John Lee, 46, a banker from Farnham Common, has had a family membership at the club along with his wife and son for the last five years.Closing it for two years is going to lose them members, he said. Some won’t come back because we now have to look for other clubs. There\u0027s probably four or five others near where we live, where you can take the family and have fun.Sue Gaskell, 74, from Marylebone, London, has been a member for 21 years and is a former lady captain of the club.The letter we received kept saying \u0027we\u0027re delighted, we\u0027re delighted\u0027 – well, you\u0027re shutting the place down! she said.Several people were in tears. There\u0027s one girl who lives round the corner who bought the property specifically to play golf here.There\u0027s rumours going around they\u0027ll have an exclusion zone around the mansion so plebs like me can\u0027t go in.Asked to clarify whether Mr Ambani intended to create a private residence, the spokesman said the new owners have been clear they will restore the club to its former glory, adding that its members remained the beating heart of Stoke Park and they look forward to welcoming them back to share a glorious future.He refused to be drawn on whether membership fees would increase.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government not enough tackle extremism behind britains rise","story":"It’s a worrying time for social cohesion. First there was Batley Grammar School, with a young teacher forced into hiding over a picture. Then the disturbing sight of a convoy of thugs driving through parts of North London broadcasting antisemitic obscenities. British Jews have been assaulted in broad daylight. And a Leeds headteacher who dared to suggest that schools should be kept free of partisanship has been hounded into a humiliating retreat. Social media has been awash with hateful commentary.You’d think that the government might take a view on this. Gavin Williamson has at last acknowledged that there is a problem. But he and other ministers have failed to meet the challenge. And the police – doubtless hoping to dial down tensions – too often tolerate what should not be tolerated. The result is that, with a few exceptions, those who threaten to rape Jewish women, or proclaim that “From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be Free” (therefore erasing Israel from the map) seem free to do so.It is perfectly legitimate to criticise the Israeli Defence Forces, settlement activity or the discrimination that Palestinians face. But holding all Jews responsible for the actions of the Israeli government, essentialising them as irredeemably hostile to Palestinian rights and demonising Israel for existing, is not.There is a profound difference between Islam as a lived faith and a rich 1400-year old tradition of philosophy, law and moral guidance, and Islamism as a modern revolutionary project. Historically, life for minorities in Islamic lands was not always the wonderland of tolerance that some like to imagine. Ask the Armenians, Copts or Maronites. But by and large people found ways to get by. To this day, many Iraqis and Egyptians bitterly regret the disappearance of the once thriving Jewish communities of Baghdad, Cairo and Alexandria.In contrast, Islamism may be said to be constitutively anti-semitic. The reasons are complex. They include the flood of Jewish immigrants into Mandate Palestine from the 1920s onwards and the wider legacies of British and French colonialism. Jerusalem – sacred to three faiths - has certainly been a factor. But there is something darker involved, reflecting the way in which Islamism emerged from the same milieu as much modern European counter-enlightenment discourse, including German ethno-nationalism, French anti-semitism and Italian fascism – mapped onto existing anti-western prejudices.Paradoxically, it is this stew of intellectual influences that explains the otherwise strange alliance between elements of the British Left and Islamists. Adapted by 20th century European theorists, it also helped shape what has become known as Critical Theory. This – like Islamism - has developed a view of the modern West as deranged and destructively rational. Imperialism and colonialism are seen as exclusively Western crimes. And behind all this lies the original sin of Whiteness.This is why the apostles of Critical Race Theory like to categorise Jews as White. Doing so enables them to frame Jews not as the victims of 1000 years of European persecution but as the heirs of European colonial aggression. Islamists wholeheartedly agree. For them, Muslims are the victims Israel the enduring symbol of Western – and White – hostility towards them.This discourse is no longer confined to Islamist circles. But it lies behind the claims Islamists make to represent and defend Muslims collectively.Successive governments have been weak in challenging this, often in the name of some abstract idea of social cohesion but also because of a simple failure to understand. That may be why the police often seem so reluctant to check what looks like Islamist incitement while they busy themselves with arresting peaceful Christian preachers, pursuing thought crime on social media and claiming that normal press reporting makes matters worse.This isn’t about Islam, it’s about Islamism, and the allies Islamists have found on the Left. It’s about the toxic cult of critical theory, which has captured much of progressive opinion. And it is about the strange reluctance of successive UK governments to defend liberal principles. In the end, that is the real threat. President Macron in France and Chancellor Kurz in Austria have sought to grasp the nettle.

Scientists were urging Boris Johnson to play it safe and extend restrictions, businesses were screaming for normality to return.For the 2022 version of Mr Cummings, the right decision was no doubt staring Mr Johnson in the face. So simple! So obvious!Except that May 2021 is where we all are right now, and the right way forward is not obvious at all. Open up, and deaths might rise, costing lives that could have been saved. Delay “freedom day” and businesses might go to the wall needlessly. Only after the decision has been made will Mr Johnson know if he got it right.Which is exactly where he was in September last year. Mr Cummings’ portrayal on Wednesday of a Prime Minister who turned his back on reason, choosing to “hit and hope” rather than following irrefutable evidence, was a form of revisionism, according to those who lived through the frenetic late summer weeks in Government.Then, as now, it was not at all clear which way the virus was going to go. Then, as now, conflicting predictions and advice were landing on the Prime Minister’s desk. But then, unlike now, it was unclear when or even if a vaccine would be available, and in what quantities.Someone was going to turn out to be right and someone was going to turn out to be wrong, but, crucially, they could not know they were right, because they were guessing, a point which was lost on Mr Cummings when he accused Mr Johnson of being unfit for office.“By September we had the basics of an early warning system,” said one person at the heart of the Covid response at the time. “It did start to ring alarm bells but it was far from clear-cut. It certainly wasn’t a slam dunk that we had to lock down, no matter what Dominic Cummings might say.“Dom has tried to portray himself as a one-man army fighting for a second lockdown, but that’s not how it was at all. Everyone was wrestling with questions like, would people accept another lockdown, how strict it would need to be, and whether we could get through the autumn without one.“With hindsight you can argue that we should have locked down earlier than we did, but it’s incredibly unfair to say it was blindingly obvious. It simply wasn’t. We are in the same situation now. We have a new variant, we still don’t know much about it, and it’s not at all obvious what we should do.”The facts last September were that cases were beginning to rise but they were rising at a more gradual rate than in the first wave of coronavirus.Sir Patrick Vallance told Mr Johnson that if he did nothing, cases could rise to 50,000 a day. By the end of October cases were continuing to rise, but at nothing like the rate Sir Patrick had suggested, partly because of restrictions such as the rule of six and pub curfews.Mr Cummings likes to cite modelling which predicted catastrophe as evidence that Mr Johnson should have acted quicker, but Mr Johnson was well aware, as he is now, that models frequently, if not always, wildly overestimate case numbers and deaths. As recently as March, scientific advisers were stating as a fact that reopening schools would lead to a third wave of Covid, which turned out to be completely wrong.Mr Cummings also made great play of the fact that he had “warnings” about variants in September from scientists who told him “watch out for this variant, it could get very nasty”.The clear implication was that Mr Johnson turned a blind eye to the Kent variant, which later became dominant, in his determination to be “the mayor from Jaws” who prioritised the economy of Amity island in refusing to close the beaches.But the facts tell a different story. Public Health England did not detect the first case of the Kent variant until Oct 1. Mr Cummings’ evidence that he was told to watch out for “this variant” in September cannot, then, be right.It was only on December 18 that it was flagged as a variant of concern, and the following day the Prime Minister called a press conference to cancel Christmas.The data from September also jars with Mr Cummings’ account. Sir Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, were calling for a two-week “circuit breaker” lockdown in mid-September, and Mr Cummings claims “all credible serious people in my opinion were saying essentially the same thing”.At that point case numbers, having risen slowly from a midsummer low, had flattened it was only in late September that they began to rise steeply, and even then the rise was being driven by infections among under-30s, whose risk from Covid is extremely low.One of the most telling moments in Mr Cummings’ evidence was when he told the committee that in September he had been “looking back over the whole thing and doing a kind of scorecard of who’s been right about this and who’s been wrong?”. It not only assumes that people who have been right in the past will always be right in the future, but also illustrates the binary nature of Mr Cummings’ attitude to governing.“One of the problems with Dom is that he sees the world like a Punch and Judy show, where there has to be a hero and there has to be a villain,” said one person who attended multiple meetings with him. “There has to be someone who has failed.

Rather than depicting a hay wain, new evidence has emerged suggesting the picture may actually be based on a wood cart parked in north London. Although the background of Flatford Mill and Willy Lott\u0027s cottage may be familiar to art lovers, the details of the painting\u0027s creation seem to point to another source of inspiration – Whitestone Pond, in Hampstead.Now little more than a glorified traffic island, it was originally known as Horse Pond, a popular stopping place to allow horses to drink and cool off while giving farmers a chance to wash the mud from their cartwheels before driving into the city. While researching the quirkier corners of Hampstead history for his book Under Ken Wood, the writer Neil Titley discovered that the picture does not depict a hay wain at all but one of the wood carts that would have used the equine equivalent of a motorway service station. From 1819 to 1821, Constable lived at No 2, Lower Terrace, Hampstead, roughly 200 metres from Whitestone Pond. During this time he created dozens of paintings and drawings of the landscapes, sandpits and ponds that surrounded him.With only five months to complete the 6ft by 4ft canvas in time for the Summer Exhibition at the Royal Academy 200 years ago, he started panicking that he would not be able to return to Flatford Mill to refresh his inspiration.As he wrote on April 1: My picture goes to the Academy on the loth. I have yet much to do to it. While able to artificially construct the painting from previous sketches such as his circa 1810 oil of Willy Lott\u0027s cottage and his close study of cloud formations, he had no images of the main subject itself.Titley claims Constable then wrote to his Suffolk pupil John Dunthorne requesting a sketch of a hay wain – built with high sides to increase its load – yet the cart in the painting looks nothing like that.He said: It is far more likely that Constable relied on a real-life model much closer to hand. Each time he left his house, he would have seen stationary horses and carts standing up to their axles in the water at Whitestone Pond. Every type of wagon was present within a two-minute walk of his home and his easel. It may be significant that his own title was a more ambiguous Landscape: Noon – the popular name of The Hay Wain was only attached later by others.Constable completed the painting at his studio at Lower Terrace before sending it on to an initially indifferent reception at the Academy.Simon Wilson, the art historian and a former curator of Tate Britain, said Mr Titley\u0027s theory is entirely plausible and a fascinating contribution to Constable studies.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"swiss far wise nation succumb stultifying embrace brussels","story":"Switzerland has pretty much everything going for it: low taxes, high wages, minimal unemployment, dispersed government, national sovereignty, direct democracy. According to the UN Human Development Index, which measures healthcare, education, life expectancy and the like, it is the third-best country to live in the world.Its population, pre-coronavirus, would swell by around 300,000 during office hours, as people from neighbouring states crossed the border to work – and small wonder. Switzerland’s GDP per head is roughly twice the EU’s.This last point is critical in understanding why talks between Brussels and Bern broke down last week. Switzerland’s wealth has always annoyed Euro-federalists. If a country of eight-and-a-half million people can flourish so insolently, what is left of their argument that you need to be part of a big bloc in order to survive?Eurocrats rationalise Switzerland’s success by telling themselves that that country prospers through parasitism. The Swiss, they claim, get all the benefits of the EU with few of the costs. They are able to trade freely with a vast market while doing such dastardly things as cutting their taxes. I once sat through a debate in the European Parliament in which Switzerland’s low tax rates were solemnly condemned by speaker after speaker as a form of illegal state aid.The EU had been pushing since 2014 to bring the Swiss into line with other neighbouring states, collapsing around 120 different sectoral treaties into a single Framework Agreement.The Swiss had no problem with streamlining these accords, but it soon became clear that Eurocrats were not interested only in a tidying-up exercise. They wanted to pull the Helvetic Confederation more firmly into their regulatory orbit, imposing stricter rules on state aid, social security and free movement.Swiss voters felt they were being bullied. In particular, they resented being told to accept EU rules on common citizenship – including welfare claims and voting rights – when they had voted against becoming EU citizens.“It was exactly what they tried to do to you during the Brexit talks”, a Swiss MP friend and occasional skiing companion tells me. “They basically wanted us to be non-voting members, following all their rules without a say. Boris said no to them and so have we”.Did Brexit, as many Swiss believe, make the Brussels negotiators more brittle, more hypersensitive, more domineering? Perhaps a little. But, frankly, they were already displaying all these characteristics when their talks with Bern began in 2014.The EU doesn’t do give-and-take. Even when a modicum of flexibility would plainly serve its own interests, it finds it hard to move beyond issuing lordly demands.Had Brussels allowed David Cameron to retrieve just one area of jurisdiction in the 2016 talks, Britain would surely have voted to stay. Had it treated Theresa May with less obvious disdain, Britain might have ended up inside the customs union. If it were ready to compromise over the Northern Ireland Protocol, Britain would not be heading for a unilateral renunciation. But, each and every time, the EU defaults to its tetchy imperiousness.In the short term, the collapse of these talks makes little difference. Switzerland is perfectly content with the existing tangle of bilateral accords. It was Brussels that had been pushing for change.But few expect the EU to let things lie. Just as it did during the Brexit talks, it will seek to tighten the screw, excluding Switzerland from common deals on pharmaceuticals, research, financial services and more. The fact that it cannot do these things without damaging its own economy is of no concern. For Brussels functionaries, European unity is an end in itself, not a means to a better life.But the Swiss are no more likely than the British to give in to threats. If their current half-in- half-out deal status is no longer on offer, they will almost certainly move further out. And they will be right, for the best way to safeguard their prosperity is to retain the unusual political structures on which it rests.Eurocrats like to imagine that the Swiss rejected EU membership for reasons of selfishness or xenophobia. They could not be more wrong. Switzerland is an exceptionally open and multilingual society, a quarter of whose population is foreign.No, the reason the Swiss did not want to join the EU is that they could see that ever-closer union was incompatible with the principles that govern their confederation, namely the dispersal of power to the cantons and the regular use of referendums. Those precepts have served to make them the richest and freest people in Europe, and good luck to them.And if you’re one of those tiresome people who thinks it’s enormously witty, at this stage, to quote Harry Lime’s crack about cuckoo clocks from The Third Man, I can only respond that I’d take the cuckoo clocks – and the Red Cross, and Nestlé and Novartis and velcro and, yes, 500 years of brotherly love – over the self-serving European Commission any day.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"has china given easy rise covid 19","story":"We have spent the last year lambasting our own government over the handling of the pandemic – not without good reason in many cases. The US, Brazil, Sweden and many other countries: all have been accused at various times of incompetence or recklessness. Meanwhile, the country where it all began has escaped almost any kind of censure indeed, it has regularly received admiration for the way it suppressed the outbreak in Wuhan.Nothing exemplified the fawning attitude towards China than the letter sent to the Lancet last March condemning anyone who dared suggest that the pandemic could have originated from a laboratory leak in Wuhan. The scientists tried to imply that in merely raising the issue of Chinese culpability people were guilty of ‘prejudice’.That has become a regular theme. Call Covid the “China virus” or “Wuhan flu” and you will be denounced as racist – while everyone, scientists included, happily refers to the “Kent”, “South African” or “Indian” variants. Obviously, Sinophobia is to be deplored – but most of us can tell the difference between Chinese people and the Chinese state. The charge that you are insulting the former by attacking the latter is ridiculous.Even if Covid wasn’t a laboratory accident, and jumped to humans from a bat as the Chinese government wants us to believe, the country would hardly be free of culpability. Bats were known to be a reservoir from SARS-like viruses, whose potential for infecting humans was well known from the original SARS outbreak in 2002 – so why were they still on sale in wet markets? It was as if Britain had not lifted a finger to counter BSE.Then of course was the secrecy. The World Health Organisation’s praises for China’s “openness” over Covid deserved to be greeted with howls of derision after the initial efforts of authorities to silence the whistleblower who first warned of a SARS-type virus. Yet they hardly raised a whimper. The only Western leader to raise Chinese culpability was Donald Trump – and he was treated as even more of a pariah afterwards.Interestingly, the softness of our own leaders towards the Chinese state is not shared by the British public. A poll published in February by the think tank the British Foreign Policy Group found that 41 percent of the public regard China as a critical threat, and most of the rest see it as an ‘important but not critical’ threat. The numbers who see China as largely benign are well down in single figures.Yet for years UK governments have snuggled up to China. David Cameron and George Osborne repeatedly went cap in hand seeking Chinese investment for their infrastructure projects. Theresa May prevaricated over whether it was such a good idea to have China fund UK power stations, but then waved it through. Boris Johnson initially approved Huawei’s involvement in the 5G network, only changing his mind when Conservative backbenchers objected.One senses a sneaking admiration among many of our political and business leaders for the Chinese model. They see China as a country where things get done, where infrastructure can get built, businesses expanded and surveillance technology applied to everyday life – all without pesky iniduals being allowed to stand in the way of progress.Indeed, the whole policy of lockdown was imported from China by scientific advisers like Professor Neil Ferguson who, in an interview last December, couldn’t hide his awe at the way China locked down Wuhan. It’s a communist one party state, we said. We couldn’t get away with it in Europe, we thought… and then Italy did it. And we realised we could. If China were proven to be the seat of the most expensive laboratory accident in history, perhaps the scales might finally drop from our leaders’ eyes and they wake up to the reality of authoritarian government.The truth is that Covid originated in China, and its causes – whether from an animal reservoir or laboratory accident – were avoidable. The fact that it used strong-armed tactics to limit infections and deaths to lower levels than have been suffered in the West is no cause for admiration. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside time capsule home 1970s","story":"NewsInside time capsule home with s decor and colours untouched for decadesAn immaculately preserved s home with the bright colour schemes of the era including a turquoise bathroom has gone on the market in ScotlandmirrorShareCommentsBySophie LawAdvance Content WriterTim Hanlon:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe house has a bright blue carpet in the living room as well as printed curtains \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

That he thinks he can carry on asnothing has happened is testimony to the callousness of this Government.”  David Crabtree, who saw eight residents at his care homes die after being forced to take in infected hospital patients in West Yorkshire, said: “Matt Hancock’s job was to protect us and our residents, he failed and he should go.” From March  last year, as the first wave of the pandemic took hold, , frail hospital patients were sent to care homes without a test. Mr Hancock’s disastrous decision allowed the virus to seed in the deadliest of environments as the over- age group is the most vulnerable to Covid-  On April , in the first of a series of searing exposures, the Sunday People warned that care homes were a Covid time bomb and should be shielded. Ten days later the Department of Health suddenly changed tack and said patients being discharged into care homes should be tested. But by then it was too late.  The catastrophic failure helped contribute to more than , care home deaths linked to Covid in the first wave.The PM’s former top aide Mr Cummings accused Mr Hancock of “categorically” telling Boris Johnson in March that hospital patients would be tested before being discharged to care homes.But the policy was not put in place until the Prime Minister ed from his own Covid hospital battle in mid-April. Mr Johnson reportedly asked Mr Hancock: “What the hell happened ” over testing. Jo Goodman, co-founder of Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, which represents , families who have lost loved ones, said: “The picture painted this week has been that the Government threw those in care homes to the wolves and then lied about it.  “There must be an immediate inquiry into Matt Hancock’s handling for the full truth to be uncovered.” Care boss Mr Crabtree added: “If there’s any truth that he lied to Boris Johnson about testing patients before they were sent to us, then he should be done.” Mr Hancock said his recollection of events was that he only promised to introduce testing when capacity increased. In response to Mr Cummings’s claims, he told MPs: “We followed the clinical advice on the appropriate way forward.” MP Munira Wilson, the Lib Dem health spokeswoman, said: “If Matt Hancock has been found to have lied to the House of Commons he will have to go.”  Victims of the no-test policy include Bernard Kirton, , a former mayor in Whitnash, Warks, who fell ill with Covid shortly after being sent from Warwick hospital to a care home on April  last year. He died five days later. During the first wave, Mr Hancock repeatedly claimed he threw a “protective ring” around care homes. Mr Kirton’s daughter Fiona, , said yesterday: “He’s a complete liar.”  Dennis Ely, , caught Covid after five hospital patients were discharged into his Ipswich care home without being tested. He died on Good Friday last year. His daughter Lisa, , said: “Matt Hancock needs to go – my dad’s death was preventable.” Tonight the Department for Health and Social Care said: “The Health and Social Care Secretary’s focus throughout this pandemic has been on saving lives. Guidance for the care sector was first published in February . At this time, the scientic understanding did not suggest asymptomatic iniduals posed a signicant risk in terms of transmission. “Those with symptoms would have been tested on admission or during a hospital stay and were isolated accordingly. Further guidance was issued on  March  setting out how we would continue to support the safe discharge of people who no longer needed to stay in hospital.” aposHANCOCK IS INCOMPETENT AND NEEDS TO GOapos  Amos Waldman, , called for Matt Hancock to go after losing his grandmother to Covid. Sheila Lamb, , whose son Nigelis Amos’s dad, died in a north London care home in April last year. Amos, a barrister from Heaton Chapel, Greater Manchester, said: “Every time Matt Hancock mentions the protective ring it’s like being punched in the gut – because it’s untrue. “The only ring around care homes was to protect us from seeing the horror of what was going on. This rewriting of history concerns me.”  The son of a woman who died of Covid in her care home  months ago said Matt Hancock must go. Shocked Alan Wightman added as he mourned his mother Helen: “He has repeatedly told untruths. “We knew there was never a protective ring around care homes and we know from SAGE minutes that scientists warned on asymptomatic transmission as early as January . ”Alan, , from Bedale, North Yorks, went on: “For Hancock to say he didn’t know is nonsense. “They did know. They just did nothing about it. Hancock is incompetent and should go.”FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSCare homesPoliticsCoronavirusMatthew Hancock MP"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic cummings tv vengeance marathon","story":"NewsopinionDominic Cummings TV vengeance marathon was compelling - and horricDominic Cummings, the former special adviser to the Prime Minister, gave evidence to a select committee for  minutes.

There were explosive bits – we’ll get to those in a sec – but can we first acknowledge the size of it  Seven hours. Enough time to watch Dances with Wolves, make Jamie’s vegetable risotto, then watch Dances with Wolves again. Dominic Cummings, the former special adviser to the Prime Minister, gave evidence to a select committee for  minutes. That’s a long time. It was best treated like a test match, on in the background and run to the TV when something exciting happens. One reader did their ironing. Another bled the radiators. We found a way. What is it they say  “Months of ­inactivity punctuated by moments of extreme terror.” Mr Cummings is compelling TV with good reason. It’s very rare for anyone to give an accurate, contemporaneous picture of what happens at the heart of government. What is it they say  “Laws, like sausages, cease to inspire respect in proportion as we know how they are made.”Some of it was straight, stone-cold, amazing for the sheer horror of it. The care home scandal, the sheer lack of planning and foresight, the battling egos. The utter testosterone-fuelled incompetence. A glimpse into the inner-workings of something that really doesn’t work.  I can’t imagine anyone taking any comfort from it. Mr Cummings began ­apologetically but it quickly became clear he had a dferent agenda. This was about being as explosive as possible, settling old scores by casually lobbing grenades. Some pegged him as an unreliable narrator. It doesn’t really matter. This was testimony from a man who has been at the very centre of things and wanted to tell us all about it. At one point he answered a question by beginning: “I don’t have an opinion on that” – which we can peg as a definite lie. Mr Cummings has an opinion on everything. As he warmed up, he took on the manner of one of those blokes who corners you in the pub when you’re ­trying to read the paper.  The longer they go on the more random it gets: here we got multiple Bill Gates references, Spider-Man, Independence Day. Anthrax and shopping trollies and Jaws. But, like Mr Cummings, they really warm up when you get them on about their ex. In this case, the Prime Minister, those who work for him, his fiancée Carrie Symonds, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the people who work for him. Even Dilyn the dog got a metaphorical kicking.

Fears over the spread of the Indian iant and hospitals coming under pressure risk delaying the official roadmap. Ministers are understood to be drawing up plans for a partial end to the lockdown, despite the government previously hoping to end all legal restrictions from June  at the earliest. The roadmap would potentially allow parties of hundreds of people and the reopening of nightclubs in just a few weeksapos time. But vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi warned the Government would have to be cautious in deciding whether it can press ahead with its relaxation of restrictions in England as planned. “We have to be cautious. We have to look at the data and share it with the country, he told the BBC.  Are we still vaccinating at scale  Big tick. Are the vaccines working  Yes. “But are infection rates too high for us to then not be able to proceed because there are too many people going into hospital  I don’t know the answer to that. We will know it hopefully on June .”The continued spread of the Indian coronavirus iant has prompted experts to argue restrictions should remain in place until more people have received both doses of a vaccine.Hospitals chief Chris Hopson called for a more informed debate on the planned lting of all legal limits on social contact. The NHS Providers chief executive said hospitals are currently coping with the strain of Covid but other people who put off treatment are now coming forward. “We know this iant is much much more transmissible and lots more people still need a vaccination,” he told the BBC. “We need a really good high quality debate about how quickly should we open up on June .” A top Government scientist claimed there was still an awful lot of uncertainty over whether the June  date can go ahead. Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on ModellingGovernment advisory , said: I think at the moment thereaposs quite a lot of uncertainty around that. “We are starting to see signs of course that cases are going up, but at the moment weaposre still obviously reporting hospital admissions and deaths at very low levels. Prof Linda Bauld of Edinburgh University warned that the data and evidence did not support lting the remaining lockdown restrictions on June . It is too early to be charging ahead, she said. I would like to see seven more weeks data and the kind of evidence I want to see, and all my colleagues, that the chains of transmission, the links between the fact that we had slightly more cases when we opened up but it is moving through the system to people who are becoming unwell.  Labour leader Keir Starmer warned plans to lt almost all Covid- restrictions could be at risk because of serial incompetence and “civil war” inside Boris Johnson ’s government.In his strongest attack for months on the PMaposs handling of the pandemic, he said: Weak, slow decisions on border policy let the Indian iant take hold, he said. Lack of self-isolation support and confused local guidance failed to contain it. We all want to unlock on June  but the single biggest threat to that is the Governmentaposs incompetence.  Data suggests that although hospital admissions are rising in some parts of the country affected by the Indian iant, overall admissions remain broadly flat. However, the R number for England is  to ., up from . and . the previous week, suggesting the epidemic is growing. One scientic adviser warned confusion over the Government’s handling of Covid restrictions was undermining efforts to control the virus. Prof Stephen Reicher, who sits on a SAGE sub-committee, said the Government was in a “pickle” because it appeared to have abandoned the “data not dates” principle.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNadhim ZahawiBoris JohnsonHospitalsPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock lied crucial ppe","story":"NewsMatt Hancock lied about crucial PPE putting thousands of frontline health workers at riskEXCLUSIVE: It is claimed the Health Secretary said a shipment of masks and gowns from China had been \"sorted out and there was no problem\" - but more than two weeks later it still had not arrivedmirrorShareCommentsByNigel NelsonPolitical EditorChris McLaughlin:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video matt-hancock-denied-dominic-cummings-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:tyAXIC,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

But a No source said more than two weeks later a screen in the Cabinet Room showed the consignment flashing red – meaning it had not arrived.Chancellor Rishi Sunak had to clear up the mess and No adviser Dominic Cummings “went into a rage” and was furious the PPE was coming by boat instead of chartered planes. More than  of , frontline health workers went on to die in the pandemic, many complaining of PPE shortages. The source told the Sunday Mirror: “Nearly everything Hancock said we would later discover was diametrically opposite to the truth. He said bringing in PPE from China had been cleared and it turned out it hadn’t.” A government spokesman said  billion PPE items had been delivered and added: “These claims are unsubstantiated and we reject them. The Government worked flat out to get the PPE needed for the frontline.  “The National Audit Office recognised all NHS providers they spoke to were able to get the equipment they needed in time.” Our informant reveals claims that Hancock presided over other blunders around care homes and those shielding at home. Labour ’s Richard Burgon said: “Matt Hancock should resign andhe doesn’t he should be sacked.” And writing in the Observer, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “Twice as many people died in the second wave than in the first. That was avoidable and unforgivable.” In evidence to MPs, Cummings said Hancock should have been sacked and accused him of lying over saying patients were being tested before ing to care homes. The Health Secretary says he only recollects promising checks would be made “when we could do it”. The PM has backed Hancock. But the No insider accused the Health Secretary of consistently telling lies at the am Covid meetings. Of the China PPE debacle, the insider added: “Dom went into a rage. Rishi had to unlock this. He said the Dept of Health could have any money it needed to get PPE through.” The insider claims Hancock and NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens were in chaos. An emergency No unit under former Vote Leave head of research Oliver Lewis had to be set up to identy those most likely to die so they could receive food parcels while isolating.

Former-No adviser Dominic Cummings said Hancock should have been sacked for misinforming the public with many people dying at care homes in March and April last year who brought the virus back with them from hospitals.Cummings told MPs last Wednesday: We were told categorically in March that people would be tested before they went back to care homes. We only subsequently found out that that hadnapost happened. The government rhetoric was we put a shield around care homes - it was complete nonsense”. His comments have been followed by the Tories dropping six points in an opinion poll on Saturday. But Hancock still retains the backing of some members of the Tory party who do not agree with Cummings’ assessment that he lied to the prime minister.  One Tory MP said: “He wouldn’t dare go on telly to promise what he thought he couldn’t deliver. “Matt is the kind of guy who sh**s at his own shadow.” It comes as a Downing Street eyewitness has alleged that Hancock told the prime minister that protective clothing was on its way for thousands of NHS staff in March , when he knew it wasn’t. It is claimed by the Sunday Mirror source that he lied about a shipment of badly needed masks and gowns that were supposed to be coming from China saying it had been “sorted and there was no problem”.  The insider also claims Hancock and NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens were in chaos. An emergency No unit under former Vote Leave head of research Oliver Lewis had to be set up to identy those most likely to die so they could receive food parcels while isolating.

Agents are investigating a possible leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, reports claim. Previously, British, American and other western intelligence agencies have appeared to discount the possibility of a lab leak. But now, sources claim there has been a reassessment and deemed the possibility as feasible. The Times says the development, which Beijing has angrily denied, has prompted US diplomatic sources to share their concerns we are one wet market or bio lab away from the next spillover.MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, told The Times: “The silence coming from Wuhan is troubling. We need to open the crypt and see what happened to be able to protect ourselves in the future. That means starting an investigation, along with partners around the world and in the WHO.” Asked about the speculation that the virus could have escaped from a Wuhan lab, Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News: “I think it’s really important that the WHO is allowed to conduct its investigation unencumbered into the origins of this pandemic and we should leave no stone unturned to understand why.” It was claimed that three researchers from the Wuhan lab that investigated Covid- fell ill just weeks before the virus emerged as a mystery illness.The workers from the Wuhan Institute of Virologywere sick enough that they had to go to a hospital for treatment in November , according to a previously undisclosed US intelligence report.The report, which was revealed by the Wall Street Journal, has fuelled calls for a broader investigation into the theory that the initial outbreak was caused by a leak at the laboratory. The Wuhan Institute of Virology has denied that a leak was to blame, though a group of leading scientists has said the virusapos origin is still unclear and the theory needs to be taken seriously until a rigorous data-led investigation proves it wrong.Covid- emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late  and rapidly spread around the world, infecting more than  million people and killing almost . million so far.

The Royal Family is continuing to support the bereaved monarch and the Duke of Kent will step in for this year’s Trooping the Colour on June  to accompany her.He already carried out the role back in  while Prince Philip was recovering from surgery.Palace sources have said that the Queen is now looking to up personal engagements following the death of Philip and with the Covid restrictions now easing. She is believed to have a “genuine enthusiasm” for more engagements. “There is a strong desire toto normal duties and for the country toto normal too,” said the Daily Mail’s Palace source. At the same time her family don’t want her to be on her own at events like the Trooping the Colour as she was last year at a scaled-back parade at Windsor Castle.Then the Queen is expected to travel to Cornwall for the G summit meeting of leading industrial nations where she will greet US President Joe Biden along with representatives also from Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. The aim is to have a royal task force to meet the leaders with Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall along with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in the welcoming party. If the Queen and other senior royals met with Biden in Cornwall it would mean there would be no need to avoid a state visit for the president later in London. Still Biden is expected to have a full state visit at some point and he will be the th US leader to meet her.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnTrooping the ColourThe QueenDuke of KentPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal Family"},{"url":null,"title":"adorable dog found perilously close","story":":root Adorable dog found perilously close to motorway and police want to find their ownerThe animal, believed to be a Cockerpoo or Labradoodle, was rescued by traffic officers near junction  of the M, close to Markfield in LeicestershireAdorable dog found perilously close to motorway and police want to find their ownerThe animal, believed to be a Cockerpoo or Labradoodle, was rescued by traffic officers near junction  of the M, close to Markfield in LeicestershireThe cute pet has been taken to a vet, Highways England saidImage: HIGHWAYS ENGLAND EMIDS TwitterByJamie Barlow:,  May An adorable dog has been found at the side of a motorway - as an appeal is launched to find its owner.

Sunseekers from all over the country unrolled their towels to make the most of the weather after weeks of grey weather and heavy downpours. In Seven Sisters National Park in East Sussex, a group of people were seen getting terryingly close to the edge of a Birling Gap clf. Some appeared to have gone up to enjoy the view while others posed for photos, with one testing out a selfie stick yards away from the rock face. Others were seen looking down the side catching a glimpse of the steep drop down to the sea below. The clfs stand above Birling Gap beach, one of many seaside destinations to be packed with tourists over the weekend. The sudden rush has sparked travel chaos up and down the country, with millions stuck in traffic jams or crowded into train stations. It comes ahead of the first Bank Holiday Monday to hit since the latest easing of lockdown restrictions in Boris Johnsonaposs roadmap.  Across England outdoor socialising of up to  people was given the go ahead on May  as well as indoor service at pubs and restaurants. Hospitality venues have also been drawing huge crowds of revellers since Friday, but the scenes come amid growing concerns about the rapidly-spreading Indian iant of Covid. The balmy weather is expected to continue into Monday, when the mercury is set to hit up to C in parts of London and C in Newcastle. Met Office forecaster Matthew Box said: Itaposs obviously a welcome change I think for many.Given that we have had a reasonably cold and then a wet couple of months through spring, with April being cold and May being wet and cloudy and generally on the cool side too, weaposve got a sunny end to May. It might catch a few people out given that we havenapost seen much sun and UV levels are going to be quite high over the weekend as well so thataposs something to be aware of. Ben Aldous, from the RAC, said: Our research points to Saturday and Monday being the busiest days, but in reality thereaposs a good chance the weather will have the final say as to how busy the roads get.

The craze sees young people placing the small beads on their tongue to create the impression that they have a tongue piercing - but the balls can easily be swallowed. Ingesting more than one magnet poses a risk of serious damage as the two pieces can attract each other inside the body and block intestines or bowels. At least  children in England have needed le-saving surgery after swallowing magnets over the past three years. Health officials have warned that there has been a spike in hospital admissions in older children as some have been taking part in the trend. It led the NHS to issue a patient safety warning earlier this month, and the service is now pushing for a full-on ban on some of the toys. The news comes after -year-old Ellis Tripp was left fighting for his le after he swallowed several magnets last week. His mum Amy Clarke, , made a heartfelt plea urging other parents to get rid of the toys, branding them deadly.She posted on Facebook : Iaposm in a nightmare.This TikTok craze could would have killed himleft any longer.

Destroy them.!!!!! Doctors said he was the fth youngster in just one week they have treated for swallowing magnets, reports his family. And Ellisaposs school found other pupils with the magnets in their possession during a search, suspected to be linked to the TikTok trend. The prank sees children place two magnetic balls on either side of their tongue and wiggle it around, creating the illusion of a permanent piercing. A -year-old girl is also understood to have had major surgery after trying out the social media craze.Her mum, Faye Elizabeth, said she had swallowed  of the tiny beads, according to the Liverpool Echo.Health officials have now stressed that the toys are dangerous and said their sale should be banned. Professor Simon Kenny, NHS England national clinical director for children and young people, said: Magnets are a source of fascination for children, and magnetic toys can look like a cheap and cheerful way of occupying the kids, but ultimately they arenapost safe and shouldnapost be for sale.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSHospitalsToysTeenagersChildcare"},{"url":null,"title":"conman evicted flat shared mum","story":"NewsStalker conman repeatedly tricked bailfs into kicking new owner out of flatEXCLUSIVE: Shahrooz Ghassemian, , was jailed for six years after he became obsessed with the propertymirrorShareCommentsByAdela Whittingham:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY News and his mother Hamilaafter their eviction in September \" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Shahrooz-Ghassemian.jpg\"Two police officers speak to Shahrooz Ghassemianafter his eviction in September ,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Shahrooz Ghassemian, , used forged court documents to fool them so he could get back in – once while the buyer was on holiday. A court heard he had a fixation with the £, rented flat he and mum Hamila had lived in for  years that was comparable to a stalker. Tonight as pictures emerged of one of Ghassemian’s evictions at the home, the new owner, who did not want to be named, said: “The last time police discovered him on the couch watching TV, drinking a can of coke from the fridge in my own home. I was quite uncomfortable It’s horrible. He’s an idiot.”  The drama began after Ghassemian and Hamila were evicted from the one-bedroom flat in Kensington, West London, in  after falling into arrears with the freeholder. The flat was sold in March  so debts could be recovered. The new owner first encountered Ghassemian when he was having renovations done before moving in. “He broke in and ended up living there for a couple of months until we could evict him,” said the owner. “The second time he broke in I had moved in but was on holiday with my girlfriend. He called me and said ‘you have  hours to get your stuff’. We were in shock. We rang friends to go over there, but they found the door locked. They called the police.”  After Ghassemian’s arrest, his High Court deceptions were discovered. At a hearing in October , Mr Justice Henry Carr had ruled £, from the sale of the flat was to be paid to the court so money owed to the freeholder and another creditor could be paid back. It emerged Ghassemian forged a court document stating the sum was to be paid in full to his mother who died in a care home in March last year. Ghassemian was blocked from receiving the payment by three dferent banks, but he ed to court several times with further fake papers. This week Ghassemian, of Westminster, was jailed for six years at Isleworth Crown Court on three counts of perverting the course of justice. Prosecutor Susannah Stevens said: “Mr Ghassemian fraudulently obtained High Court orders and schedules. “His conduct was sophisticated, using judges’ handwriting and judges’ signatures. He inflicted signicant harm on a number of people both psychologically and financially.”Judge Martin Edmunds told him: “You continue to hold the belief that you ought to be entitled to occupy the flat. Your belief is of the order of an obsession comparable to the fixed ideation of a stalker.” The first-time buyer is said to be £, out of pocket in legal fees as a result of his years-long battle due to be heard in the civil courts. He fears he will never be able to sell the flat because of its legal history.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnRickysCourt caseCrown courtSunday Mirror"},{"url":null,"title":"covid great leveller  even","story":"NewsopinionCovid was the great leveller – even the richest b***h couldn’t pay for private jabAfter representing the UK’s top leading ladies, it’s now Melanie’s turn to take centre stage and with a rags-to-riches story like hers, she’s living proof that any woman can live the le most only dream of.

His sister, Janet Alder, , who lives in West Yorkshire, has spent two decades campaigning for justice. Here, she tells her story… A year has passed since I – along with the rest of the world – watched the video of George Floyd’s le being casually snuffed out in utter horror. Seeing Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on his neck for over nine minutes, I even felt my own chest restricting and throat closing. It reminded me of another black man I’d seen slowly die in police custody – my own brother, Christopher. We grew up in Hull in the s and s and there were five of us kids: Emmanuel, Richard, Christopher, me – the only girl – and Stephen. Our parents had come from Nigeria in search of a better le, but Dad worked all hours and Mum, struggling to raise us, began having psychotic episodes. So our childhood was spent in a children’s home. Christopher and I, as the middle kids, were especially close. He excelled at sports and dancing. I really looked up to him. As the only black family at school, kids often used the N-word and called me “rubber lips”. But Christopher protected me. He had a jokey way of getting through the hard times. He had strong morals, and after school he joined the army. He wanted to fight for his country. For six years he served as a paratrooper in the Falklands and Northern Ireland before ing to Hull to train as a computer programmer. My brother always helped others. After his death, neighbours wrote saying how he’d run chores.  One girl remembered how he’d protected her in a nightclub. No one had a bad word to say about him. It was on  April  when Christopher, then  and a separated father-of-two, got into a fight outside a nightclub. He’d lost consciousness, and a tooth, before an ambulance took him to hospital accompanied by police officers. His injuries were not deemed le-threatening, so he was discharged then taken into custody. By the time he arrived at the station, he was unconscious again, missing another tooth, and now had cuts on the lip and above the eye. He was dragged handcuffed into the custody suite, his trousers and boxer shorts around his ankles and his belt missing, and left face down on the floor.  No attempt was made to put him into the recovery position, and CCTV footage – which I had to wait two excruciatingly painful years to be allowed to see – showed five officers casually standing around him. For  minutes they chatted about what they could possibly charge him with while my brother lay unconscious gasping for breath and gurgling in his own blood as his le seeped away. Then, once it was obvious he was dead, there was talk of “f**king banana boats” and monkey noises were made. In the recent series of TV’s Line Of Duty this detail was featured in a plot – and it was taken from Christopher’s case. Seeing the footage of my brother – out of reach on the screen – bound, motionless and treated so inhumanely, became the very worst moment of my le. I just stared in shock. I feel sure the Floyd family felt the same way – disbelieving, horried, powerless. And I am sure they felt, as I did, the devastating frustration when none of the other officers attempted to intervene.  In Christopher’s case, one of the officers even said he was worried about asphyxia. But none of them attempted to move him into the recovery position, let alone take him to hospital. I’d never seen anyone die, until I was forced to watch my own brother dying in front of my eyes. And I couldn’t do a thing to help. The Floyd family had to witness the le being squeezed out of their beloved’s chest. That’s horric enough – but then they had to deal with the defence trying to deflect blame onto some supposed “underlying health conditions”. We had the same experience. In Christopher’s case the Home Office pathologist, in his original autopsy, suggested Christopher may have died of “cardiac arrhythmia” rather than asphyxia. It made no sense to us as there was no evidence, and Christopher, as an ex- paratrooper, was fighting fit. The autopsy was then used to justy not charging the officers involved. Later, Christopher’s heart was examined by a cardiologist. He told me, “You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to see Christopher died because of the position he’d been left in, and the fact no one had tried to help him.” It took almost four years of us battling until the CPS agreed in October  to prosecute the officers for gross negligence manslaughter. Like the Floyds, we had to obtain the required medical evidence for this ourselves. Even once we had done so, in my opinion the CPS delayed and delayed. In , five officers were eventually charged with manslaughter and misconduct, but were eventually acquitted.  But there was more horror in store. In , we had finally been given Christopher’s body – or so we thought – to be laid to rest. Using money I had been given from a newspaper interview, and people’s kind donations, we held a beautul burial to give Christopher the send-off he deserved. There was a procession through Hull, we ordered flowers spelling out his name, and even a horse and cart. The church was packed. Yet it wasn’t until  years later that we discovered we’d been mourning the wrong body. We had not buried our beloved Christopher, but instead the body of Grace Kamara, a -year-old Nigerian woman. Grace had died in  in Hull, from natural causes. Immediately, a close friend had begun the laborious process of applying for visas for Grace’s African family to attend her funeral. Inexplicably, the visas were subjected to endless delays. It was not until  that Grace’s relatives had their visas approved and prepared for the burial, scheduled for  November, . As part of Nigerian custom, her relatives demanded a lace scarf be buried with Grace’s coffin. Which is when the council made a terrible admission. Grace’s body was not, in fact, in the mortuary where it was supposed to be. It had been buried as Christopher back in . A criminal investigation was ordered into this so-called “mix-up” and it was carried out by South Yorkshire Police. It concluded in May  that mortuary workers did indeed have a “case to answer”, and had missed at least  opportunities to report what had happened. But in October that year, the CPS said it would not prosecute anyone. We ended up holding a second funeral, this time for our actual brother, in ,  years after his death. Despite an inquest ruling a verdict of unlawful killing, no inidual or organisation has ever been officially held to account for what happened to Christopher. Thankfully, as a result of the worldwide protests, the Floyd family will see Chauvin serve time in jail for his crime. I am desperate for Christopher to have the same justice. It is encouraging that the Black Lives Matter movement is making a real impact now. But we must keep the pressure onjustice is to be served.Janet Alder is currently crowdfunding to get justice for her brother.For more information, go to fundrazr christopheralder.The South Yorkshire Police said it is “aware of the concerns raised by Mrs Alder” and is “exploring the detail of those concerns”.

That was what happened to Ekow Otoo – an actor, spoken-word poet and model. “My legs had been giving me problems for years I was suffering a relapse and felt too weak to cook, so I’d ordered a takeaway. I remember being pinned to the wall when I took the pizzas from the delivery guy – they were too heavy to walk with,” says Ghanian-born Londoner Ekow, now . Ekow, who now knows he has multiple sclerosis , started experiencing issues aged . “I tried to get out of my bed one morning and my legs wouldn’t follow. After a nap they were fine again, but next time I played basketball I couldn’t run – my knees would buckle and I couldn’t get any speed.” A GP put the issue down to Ekow shooting up six inches in just one year. “They just thought I’d grown too quickly and my muscles were catching up.” MS is an inflammatory disease in which the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. Slowly the disease affected Ekow to the point he had to give up sport entirely. “I couldn’t even walk two roads without resting on walls.” At university Ekow struggled to get information from his brain to the page. “I think they thought I was lazy,” he says. “I didn’t connect the problem with my legs, though.”  Help and advice In February , Ekow went to bed with a chest infection. “When I woke I felt funny, sat down and couldn’t stand up again. I ended up in hospital with a doctor standing over my bed, saying: ‘This is MS.’ I remember thinking, ‘Wow, there’s a name for it.’ “It was such a relief to have a definitive diagnosis. I knew it wasn’t all in my head.” When he was first given his wheelchair, Ekow was, “overcome with peace”: “I thought it was going to be a massive struggle, but I sat in the chair and pushed for the first time, and it was like all the stress melted away. “It turns out I’m really good at it. I can travel faster than I used to, without worrying I’ll fall over, look strange or have to stop.” Since his diagnosis, Ekow has relied heavily on The National Lottery-supported MS Society which proved a vital source of information and help when he needed it. He has also benefited from sports, including wheelchair racing – mentored by Paralympian Vanessa Wallace – and adapted rowing with another National Lottery-supported organisation, British Rowing. By playing The National Lottery, you raise £M for good causes every week* “Getting back into sport was the first step in finding my confidence as a wheelchair user. I just loved it – I took part in a development programme with British Rowing for a year and, in , won a para-rowing gold in the British Championships.” Ekow has even excelled at acting, and was recently picked to play the lead role in a stunning new National Lottery TV advert, which sees him performing dramatic stunts in his wheelchair.  Thanks to some clever CGI, viewers watch as he is transported from a street corner into the middle of a Viking invasion, before tearing through a museum and then taking off above the city skyline. At one point Ekow is even flung into the air as he travels through a skate park.

After successfully containing the virus for most of last year, Vietnam is grappling with a rise in infections since late April that accounts for more than half of the total , registered cases. So far, there have been  deaths. Vietnam has uncovered a new Covid- iant combining characteristics of the two existing iants first found in India and the UK, Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long said, describing it as a hybrid of the two known iants. That the new one is an Indian iant with mutations that originally belong to the UK iant is very dangerous, he told a government meeting, a recording reveals.Have you contracted the Indian iant  Let us know at webnews@mirrorThe Southeast Asian country had previously detected seven virus iants: B.., B.., DG, B... - known as the UK iant, B.., A.. and B... - the Indian iant. Long said Vietnam would soon publish genome data of the newly identied iant, which he said was more transmissible than the previously known types. The World Health Organizationhas identied four iants of SARS-CoV- of global concern. These include iants that emerged first in India, Britain, South Africa and Brazil.  Officials at the WHO did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the iant identied in Vietnam. Long said laboratory cultures of the new iant showed the virus replicated itself very quickly, possibly explaining why so many new cases had appeared in dferent parts of the country in a short period of time. The Health Ministry told the meeting the government was working to secure  million vaccine doses under the COVAX cost-sharing scheme, as well as a further  million doses of Pfizerapossvaccine and  million of Russiaaposs Sputnik V. The country of about  million people has so far received . million doses and aims to secure  million this year.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPfizer Inc.Reuters AGWorld Health OrganizationSarsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands pack uk beaches temperatures","story":"NewsThousands pack UK beaches as temperatures finally soar for Bank Holiday weekendHuge crowds descended on the UKs coastline as the Bank Holiday getaway caused long tailbacks on some motorways across the country todaymirrorShareCommentsByDave BurkeNews reporter:,  MAY NewsCrowds headed to the beach in Dorset today to take advantage of the warm weather \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Huge crowds descended on the UKaposs coastline as the Bank Holiday getaway caused long tailbacks on some motorways across the country today. Beaches in Dorset and Sussex were filled today as people enjoyed the first long weekend since lockdown restrictions were eased earlier this month. Forecasters say the good weather is due to continue into next week after one of the most miserable months on record.

The wettest locations, receiving more than twice the average rainfall, were southwest and northeast England, as well as Wales and parts of eastern Scotland. Parts of Scotland and northern England even saw snow at the beginning of the month when temperatures of -.C were recorded. Met Office forecaster Matthew Box said: Itaposs obviously a welcome change I think for many.Given that we have had a reasonably cold and then a wet couple of months through spring, with April being cold and May being wet and cloudy and generally on the cool side too, weaposve got a sunny end to May.  It might catch a few people out given that we havenapost seen much sun and UV levels are going to be quite high over the weekend as well so thataposs something to be aware of. Ben Aldous, from the RAC, said: Our research points to Saturday and Monday being the busiest days, but in reality thereaposs a good chance the weather will have the final say as to how busy the roads get.

The DWP has resumed a review of Personal Independence Paymentclaimants to identy those who may be due backdated benefits as a result of a change in the law.Benefits and Work has now identied more than  conditions that are “most likely to lead to claimants being eligible for an award of PIP arrears” which could be worth thousands of pounds, the Daily Record reports.The DWP paused its search for affected claimants in March  to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and focus on the increased demands on their services, however these restarted in October .In a recently released UK Government paper, the DWP said that by January , , the total amount of arrears payments made to PIP claimants since June  is £ million.  The backdated payments are made under what is known as the LEAP review, which began in June . It involves the DWP looking through the cases of approximately . million PIP claimants after it lost two landmark legal cases and had to amend its assessment guidance to decision makers. The independent online benefits forum has trawled through the ‘Equality Analysis PIP assessment criteria’ document which offers insight into who the DWP is likely to be looking at when considering arrears under the LEAP review. Benefits and Work said: “The original estimate by the DWP that , people would be entitled to arrears was based on claimants who scored four points for mobility descriptor b - ‘Needs prompting to be able to undertake any journey to avoid overwhelming psychological distress to the claimant’ - before the MH judgement and who also had one of the conditions listed below.”Agoraphobia Alcohol misuse Anxiety and depressive disordersAnxiety disorders Autism Bipolar affective disorderCognitive disorders Dementia Depressive disorder Drug misuse Learning disability Mood disorders Obsessive compulsive disorderPanic disorder Personality disorder Phobias Post-traumatic stress disorderPsychotic disorders Schizoaffective disorder Schizophrenia Stress reaction disordersIt should be stressed that this was just the DWP’s prediction of who is most likely to be eligible for back payments.  Benefits and Work is keen to stress that “just because your condition is not listed, that does not mean that you are not entitled to a back payment. Nor,your condition is listed here does it mean that you are going to get an award.” At the moment, rather than the original , awards being backdated to claimants, “the DWP is on course to make around ,”, said Benefits and Work. According to the DWP as part of the LEAP review: “We are looking at all current PIP claims to checkthis change means you may be eligible for more support under PIP “We are also looking again at claims we decided on or after  November  where we did not award PIP. “We will not look again at your PIP claimyou have been getting the enhanced rate of both the daily living and mobility parts of PIP since  November .”You can read the full Equality Analysis PIP assessment criteria document on GOV.UK here.What are the changes to assessment guidance  From November ,  there was a change to the way the DWP considers how overwhelming psychological distress affects a claimant’s ability to plan and follow a journey - this decision is known as ‘MH’ . From March ,  there was a change to the way the DWP considersa claimant can complete a PIP activity safely andsupervision is required, by considering both the likelihood of harm occurring, and the severity and nature of the harm that might occur - this decision is known as ‘RJ’ . Who could be affected by the change  Since June , the DWP has been searching for PIP claimants who may be entitled to back payments because their award was calculated incorrectly, under the previous assessment guidance. The changes to PIP law affects how it decides claims for:people who currently get PIP people who applied for PIP in the past but do not currently get it people moving from Disability Living Allowanceto PIP These changes are a result of amendments to PIP law for:Managing medication and monitoring a health condition - changes from  November  to  March  Safety and supervision - changes from  March  Special diet as therapy - changes from  November  Overwhelming psychological distress and planning journeys - changes from  November How many people have received back payments since June   The latest figures show that by January, , , the DWP had:Cleared around , cases against the MH decision Cleared around , cases against the RJ decisionThe DWP has also made approximately , payments to PIP claimants, of which:around , arrears payments have been made from the application of the MH decision alone around , arrears payments have been made from the application of the RJ decision alone less than  arrears payments have been made from the application of both decisions simultaneouslyThe total amount of arrears payments the department has paid out is £million, of this:£million has been paid from the application of the MH decision alone £million has been paid from the application of the RJ decision alone less than £ million has been paid from the application of both decisionsDid you know you can keep up to date with the latest news by signing up to our daily newsletter  We send a morning and lunchtime newsletter covering the latest headlines every day.

What  do I need to know  At the beginning of the administrative exercise the DWP had a dedicated resource for cases where the claimant was deceased to ensure their next of kin received payments as quickly as possible. Since then, regular checks are carried out for deceased claimants and these cases are prioritised for review. Similarly, cases are prioritised for claimants considered under Special Rules for Terminal Illness . Results of the reviews carried out as part of the administrative exercise are continually monitored, this means those claimants most likely to benefit can now be better identied. This has allowed the exercise now to be focused on these claimants and ensure they receive payments as quickly as possible. The DWP search will date back to April  for potentially affected people, including claimants who did not receive any award for PIP.

Anyone not in need of a Barnard Castle eye test was able to see that. And it did not need Dominic Cummings to say turfing patients out of hospital beds and sending them back to care homes untested bordered on the criminal. The , deaths are testament to the appalling consequences. The PM’s surprise wedding may capture the headlines but it should not deflect from the agony too many families who have lost loved ones are going through. Mr Johnson has already kicked the inevitable reckoning into the long grass by refusing to hold a public inquiry into Covid until next year.  That inquiry should have been held last summer so lessons could be learned. But as we come out of lockdown there is no excuse for further delay. Today we publish evidence to show that Matt Hancock is not fit to hold the post of Health Secretary – supplied by someone who claims to have witnessed what was going on. Mr Cummings has promised to produce documentary evidence to MPs to back up those accusations. Should that prove what he and others claim, then Mr Hancock’s position will become untenable. But Mr Hancock can still show he has at least an ounce of honour by offering Mr Johnson his resignation now.

Receptions and celebrations are also permitted for up to  people indoors or outdoors. Anyone working at events is not counted in the limits. The partial relaxation of restrictions on May  saw the cap on attendees lted from  to allow greater numbers of people to celebrate in Covid-secure venues.Have you got married during the pandemic  Let us know at webnews@mirrorChildren of all ages are included in the limits on the number of attendees for both ceremonies and receptions. Overall, the guidance advises that ceremonies and services “should be concluded in a reasonable time and be limited to those elements to ensure the marriage or civil partnership is valid in law”. Current rules say wedding guests and staff are required to wear face coverings, except when eating or drinking or where exemptions apply.  Venues and places of worship can provide food and drink, but must adhere to the guidance covering hospitality. Guests do not have to be placed on socially distanced tables, but should be served all food and drink while seated. People are encourage to “exercise caution” in relation to social distancing at events and are warned that close contact “including hugging” increases the risk of spreading Covid-. Amateur choirs, bands, or musicians may also perform at events in a group of up to six indoors, while outdoors, they can perform in multiple groups of up to . But the guidelines also state: “Dancing is advised against due to the increased risk of transmission, except the couple’s ‘first dance’.” The rules also advise that speeches should be delivered outside or in “well ventilated areas wherever possible”.The Government is aiming to lt all limits on weddings from June , but this will depend on the outcome of a social distancing review, the events research programme, as well as the impact of coronavirus iants.

A clip shared on TikTok shows a device which can be fed underneath doors and used to pull down the handle from the inside and has racked up more than  million views as it warned people of the danger.It was spotted by Josie Bowers, who replied to say that it had happened to her when she was on holiday with her family in what she says was the scariest experience of my le.Josie says when she was a teenager, she stayed in Ocean City in Maryland, US, and was alone in the hotel room getting ready while the rest of her family were still on the beach.  As she was about to get into the shower, she said she heard noises and found the contraption featured in the video had been put under the door. Before she had time to think, Josie says a man began to open the door while she was standing in her towel, and she quickly slammed it shut again and put the deadbolt on. She says the men spoke through the door to claim they were hotel workers who were there to aposfix the doorapos, but that she could tell from their clothing that they were not employees. Terried about what they were planning to do, she says in the moment she was able to recall the advice her stepdad had given her which sent the men running. Josie, now , explained: I think Iaposm very smart for this one. My stepdad is a police officer, he taught me never to let people know that you are alone. I yelled aposhey dad, thereaposs someone here to fix the doorapos. As soon as they thought that I wasnapost alone and that potentially my dad was there, they ran. They were gone. Josieaposs videos have been viewed millions of times as one person commented to say: Ok but the aposhey dad thereaposs someone hereapos idea was brilliant. You are very smart and Iaposm so glad you were okay! A second wrote: That was great thinking babe, Iaposm glad you were able to think that fast and remember something youaposd be taught.

In retaliation, he stayed at home and grabbed his grandfatheraposs pickaxe, using it to take out his frustration by angrily attacking the ground in the garden. But Andresapos act of petulance bizarrely became an obsession, and six years after the now -year-old first broke ground, he has created his very own underground man cave, with steps leading deep down to a structure comprising of a living and bedroom. Andres, who is now an actor, says he has no idea what initially sparked the idea of using his frustration to dig a hole at his family home in the town of La Romana, Spain, but he began using it as a way to wind down in the evenings after school, working on his excavation by hand several days a week. The project stepped up a few gears when his friend Andreu brought round a pneumatic drill, and the pair spent up to  hours a week digging almost -foot into the earth in his parentaposs garden. The layout of his retreat was often determined by the obstacles that got in the way of the project. He said: Sometimes I came across a big stone and it could be frustrating after hours of digging that I had done almost nothing. The soil was originally removed by hand using buckets, but as Andres went deeper and deeper, he began to study excavation techniques and later developed a pulley system to take rubble to the surface.  As he began to create rooms, he reinforced the ceilings using arched entrances and vaulted ceilings with reinforced columns to prevent a potential collapse. He estimates the project has cost him a grand total of £ . Andres has plans to expand yet further, with the cave currently boasting two rooms, a heating system, Wi-Fi provided by his phone transmitting from the cave entrance, and a music system.  The underground escape even provides a cool place to relax in the summer, with Andres explaining it stays at a constant  or  degrees in the hottest months of the year. However, he adds that it does occasionally flood during heavy rain and often attracts insects, spiders and snails. He says his parents were fine with the build - but that authorities did visit to ensure it was legal, finding no issues as it couldnapost be defined as a basement, extension or storage structure. Andres said: Itaposs great, I have everything I need. It can be tiring to work here as it is wet and there is not much air going around, but I have found my own motivation to keep on digging every day. I have always liked to build little huts. I live in the countryside and often when I found abandoned wood there, I would build a nice house. I was a kid with a lot of imagination.What do you think of the underground cave  Let us know in the comments.

after being #blown away# by the community#s support.Friends of the Den became so frustrated that the park was being repeatedly damaged that they decided to walk away.The group has overseen a massive revamp of The Den, and had sensory equipment work £, installed # which was last month burnt and torn apart by vandals.They announced they would carry no more improvements on the park but have now reconsidered after being inundated by support from local businesses to repair the damage.Earlier this month the mega deck was targeted by culprits who burned holes in the water funnel which let the water pour out.They also burned the Perspex peep windows and managed to take a gouge out of the slide.They ripped the mallet off the xylophone board which the group had paid extra to have attached so it would not get lost.The Good Sleep Company in Banff put money towards replacing the mallet for the xylophone, which was a strong favourite at the play park.Lux Hair and Beauty and the Turra Market both donated towards repairing the mega deck.Finally, Christie Landscapes were contracted to install the equipment when it was bought and they have offered to install all the new parts free of charge.Morag Lightning, chairwoman of Friends of the Den, said: #It#s fabulous, we#re just delighted.#After speaking to the police Mrs Lightning, who is also a member of the Haugh#s Redevelopment Group, is hopeful that they can link into the CCTV system that has just been installed on the main streets in Turrf.She believes that CCTV would deter the vandals from targeting the park again.Mrs Lightning said: #I don’t think that the vandals looked for sensory stuff, I don’t think they actually thought about what it was they were destroying, but it just seems to be all the sensory things that they broke.#To be honest because it seemed to be sensory equipment that was targeted the community was absolutely appalled to the extent that two people were willing to come forward with names. So I think that shows how strongly the community feel about it.#The group had decided they were finished with upgrading the park after the damages, however, they have decided to give it another chance.Mrs Lightning said: #We had already ordered and paid for seven new pieces of equipment and they’re getting installed in the beginning of June.#So, what we’re going to do is get them installed, get everything repaired and then we’re going to wait and see.#If the things don’t get vandalised we will probably carry on.

Ross Forsyth scored a  consolation for the Saints.Yet the match was far from routine, as Michie recalls: #St Johnstone had a really good side, with Keigan Parker playing up front.#They had loads of chances and really should have beat us but we snatched it.#I remember after that game Drew kind of read us the riot act, sayingwe played like that in the final we#d get hammered. But obviously he was still happy we#d got there.#Some of the Dons squad were regularly playing under-s football that season, too. The week before the final,  of them featured in a - defeat to Rangers.This doesn#t seem that notable until you have a look at some of the names in the Gers line-up: Tony Vidmar, Jesper Christiansen, Allan Johnston, Peter Lovenkrands.That#s three fully-fledged internationals and a guy who, a year on, would play upwards of  matches as the Ibrox senior side won a cup double. All of them, save Johnston, joined the Govan club for more than £million.#We were surprised to see all those big names on the teamsheet, guys who were full internationals,# said Michie, who played in the game. #But that was the season we’d run them really close in the under-s. It was a league decider at Pittodrie so they brought up all the big guns to get the result.#The Light Blues also threw in Marcus Gayle — a £million signing from Wimbledon just a few weeks beforehand — for good measure. He scored one and set up another. Rachid Belabed nicked a goal for the Reds.At the time, Dons coach Drew Jarvie had no doubt Rangers# decision to play so many first-teamers had made the dference, telling the Evening Express: #The strength of Gayle in particular caused us a lot of problems. We had a few -year-olds out there# but the experience of facing some bigger-name players will have done them a lot of good.#Maybe Jarvie was on to something.A week later, over a thousand members of the Red Army travelled south to roar on their young heroes. They were not left disappointed.The Reds came flying out the blocks at Hampden, going - up after less than two minutes when Celtic keeper Allan Morrison flapped at Bob Duncan#s in-swinging corner leaving Tiernan to poke home.In contrast, Dons custodian Mark Peat repeatedly displayed his dexterity as the sturdy Reds backline repelled Celtic#s attempts for an immediate leveller. vw, px\"  Star Celt Maloney, brought up in Aberdeen and already with Old Firm game-time under his belt, struck the woodwork while Anthony McParland and Peter Flynn also went close.The Dons had a shout for a penalty turned down when the marauding Mackie was clattered by a combination of Morrison and future Parkhead skipper McManus. Referee Charlie Richmond saw fit to book the Don for simulation instead.But the Reds rearguard#s refusal to be beaten proved to be the perfect  for a sensational second.After another Hoops foray had been snuffed out, Stephen Payne launched the ball forward.Mackie showed great strength to win the flick-on just over the halfway line before immediately setting off in support down the right.Aberdeen Youth Cup YOUTH CUP | With the Final of the Youth Cup taking place at .pm tonightlet#s throwback to the last time Aberdeen Football Club lted the Youth Cup trophy – a - victory over Celtic in .Posted by The Scottish Cup on Thursday, April , Michie controlled the ball with his chest and, spotting his partner in crime#s overlap, deftly hooked the ball over the Celtic defence into his path.Mackie, bearing down on goal, slid a left-footed pass back through to Michie, who beat the onrushing Morrison to it in the nick of time to slot home with his left.It was, Michie says, merely Jarvie#s gameplan executed as instructed.#We were set up to catch them on the break,# Michie added. #We could definitely play football but we were out to be solid in midfield and at the back, then use our pace up front.#Darren was absolutely lightning, Bob Duncan was on the left and I was up front — and a lot quicker than I am now — so we were a pacey team.#We knew Celtic had tremendous players so we#d have to sit in and take our chances.#The killer blow may have been struck with just  minutes on the clock but the disposal job was completed over the next .The granite-like Reds rearguard, granted occasional reprieve by some spirited counter-insurgency from the Dons attack, managed to stand firm in the face of Celtic#s relentless bombardment.Michie has no doubt Jarvie#s decision to recruit Dons first-teamer Kevin McNaughton played a decisive role in seeing out the match.We also got a bit of luck but sometimes you deserve that. We took our chances, they never. Ultimately that’s what it comes down to.”Scott MichieHe said: #Drew drafted in Kevin for the final, who has a big dference on the day. He was quality at the back, making sure everyone was organised to keep Celtic out.#We also got a bit of luck but sometimes you deserve that. We took our chances, they never. Ultimately that’s what it comes down to.”#It’s never easy playing the Old Firm in cup finals in Glasgow, no matter how old you are.#Jarvie said that — and he had the right of it. This match is still the last time an Aberdeen team defeated either of Celtic or Rangers in a Hampden final.The Dons boss was particularly pleased to send the travelling Red Army contingent back up the road thoroughly enthused about the club#s future.It carried a special signicance as the Dons fans had endured double Hampden heartbreak one season prior, watching the senior side reach the final of both the Scottish Cup and League Cup before falling to Rangersand Celticrespectively.Jarvie said at the time: #There were around , of them but it seemed like  times more judging by the amount of noise they made. They roared the lads on from start to finish.#The victory is for them because we know how desperate the fans are for any type of success.It doesn#t matter what level it is, I know a lot of people will get a lt from seeing the lads do well at Hampden#Drew Jarvie#It doesn’t matter what level it is, I know a lot of people will get a lt from seeing the lads do so well at Hampden.#We got a special satisfaction out of knowing they went back home happy last night.#Likewise, Michie remembers: #There was quite a good crowd at the semi-final in Perth as well but it was great to see over , Aberdeen fans come down for the final — between players’ friends and families and just genuine Dons supporters there to cheer on their youth team.#It was brilliant for us to win it but it was just as good for them to see the young team win — it’d have made it an easier journey up the road!

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Ignore a small path to your right and continue to a T-junction.Turn rightpast the village playing fields, with woods to your left.

Right will take you back down to the harbour and past potential refreshments.*You can also follow part of the coast or go over the top to Port Righand along the edge of the golf course via Airds Castle ruins before dropping back down to Carradale harbour.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy running a mok but please do so safely","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"safety first as shops reopen","story":"Wyvex MediaUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin. The idea of using alcohol is not new, but a fatal obstacle has been the unwillingness of the government to release its hold upon alcohol and permit it to be used for commercial purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in. But our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.The uncertainty during the Covid lockdown over access to basic shopping and medication, a lack of information in accessible formats, the social isolation, the barriers to being guided because of social distancing # these have all added to and compounded the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.But we want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.To contact the Need to Talk service, phone the RNIB Helpline on    or email needtotalk@rnib.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types, providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew.Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and Midsummer#s Day arrives, here are few #must do# jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:CAPTION:June is the perfect month for creating an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.

Mr Mitchell acknowledged receipt of these answers.I was alarmed and saddened by the headline #Failing# school is #betraying# pupils and the community# in last week#s Courier.Coming from a retired Campbeltown Grammar Schoolteacher, it is hard to believe that someone who has worked in the profession could have such criticism for his her fellow colleagues.Although clearly passionate about the future of CGS, perhaps retirement has helped this inidual forget what a challenging job all school staff face.It is commonly known that CGS has not had its troubles to seek in recent years with major staff shortages due to ill health and other unforeseen circumstances.The league tables do not make good reading but, on their own, I don#t think they reflect the efforts of the staff.It is a well known fact that you can take a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. Is the behaviour of pupils the greatest barrier to success Despite the efforts of teachers to discipline the pupils, there are few deterrents for the offenders, especially where the pupil is aware that,they ask, the parent will fight their corner instead of backing the school.The responsibility of teaching our children to behave and respect others needs to be instilled from early years by us all and not just when the child reaches CGS.Maybe the retired teacher should offer his her skills and visit CGS and see the problems that all staff are facing It is time for the community to pull together and support our school and encourage our children to believe that a good education is very achievable in CGS.Recently, an investigation by the Herald newspaper uncovered that #just over half of Scotland#s leline ferry network is operating outwith its working le expectancy#, with  vessels out of  in operation over  years old.Despite the huge challenges created by the Covid- pandemic that our hard-working ferry crews have to deal with,  residents rightly expect a high quality ferry service that runs on time and has enough space to ensure they can travel to and from the islands, businesses can transport goods to the mainland and tourists can visit our islands to boost the economy.Unfortunately, cancellations and delays continue to plague routes.

They discovered lots of interesting patterns but no real geodes – this is perhaps a lelong project for some.Other pupils are interested in the shells and crabs on the beach. Crabs #body parts# are often collected and it is deemed a good finda moveable claw or leg can be worked.During one visit, the youngsters searched for shark egg cases and, after what seemed to be a fruitless hunt, more than  were found in one morning when their eyes became accustomed to what they were searching for.

Did he feel embarrassed in front of his friends who did not share his doubts, did he feel ashamed that his faith had not remained resolute or was he able to put those feelings aside and share the joy of the risen Lord We do know that Thomas responded with the words: #My Lord and my God.#More than two thousand years later, we may feel embarrassedour faith falters and doubts set in.However, we should focus on the happiness of which Jesus speaks.Have the strength and hope to echo the words of Thomas: #My Lord and my God.#Do not beat yourself up for doubting – have the strength to believe."},{"url":null,"title":"author meyrick moves into gangland territory","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

He made sure that parts of the old castle were demolished for the stone to be harvested to build the -metre lighthouse, which served its purpose well for many years to come.It was lit with gas derived from vaporised paraffin oil for many years, monitored by the lighthouse keeper.Since , when the lighthouse was converted to electricity and remotely controlled, the lighthouse keeper was no longer needed, and the Bass Rock has been without any permanent human resident.From his house lsquoRockstowesrsquo on Melbourne Road, the celebrated postcard artist Reginald Phillimore enjoyed uninterrupted views of the Bass Rock.He had a fascination with the island, visited it many times and wrote a guidebook that he published himself.The Bass Rock is home to the largest gannet colony in the world: , birds spend their summer residence here, having been in Africa for the winter.The gannet, or lsquosolan goosersquo as it was known in Phillimorersquos time, is a large and formidable-looking seabird, with a white body, a yellow neck and head, and black and white speckled wings and tail.The reason that much of the Bass Rock appears white from a distance is the sheer number of birds and their acrid droppings.The gannet hunts fish by ing headlong into the sea, as any visitor to the Bass Rock can observe at close range.The air is full of birds, which are squawking cacophonously, and the smell from their droppings is very noticeable.Phillimore made some beautul postcards featuring the Bass Rock gannets he is likely to have travelled to the island from Canty Bay or on a vessel from North Berwick, but nowadays access to the Bass can be arranged via the Scottish Seabird Centre.This is an edited extract from Jan Bondesonrsquos book R.P.

These animals are easily adaptable to a iety of habitats: from meadows to woods to city streets. They can also survive on a wide range of food, such as small mammals, invertebrates and fruit, but they will take advantage of food discarded by people.Foxes are social animals who live in small groups that consist of a breeding male , a femaleand their cubs. Usually, the male and female bond for le but there will be occasions when the male may seek additional mating opportunities.Mating takes place in winter and this is when foxes are most vocal. If you happen to have a window open on a winter night and you hear a loud screaming noise that sounds like a high-pitched screech, it is most definitely a fox looking for a mate and fending off its rivals.In spring, females give birth to several cubs, which become fully self-sufficient by autumn when they leave their parents. Some cubs may decide to stay with their family and they will play a big part in raising the following yearrsquos litter.My adventure with foxes started not that long ago. I was always fascinated by them but never really happened to photograph them. Occasionally, I was lucky to catch a glimpse of a fox but usually it was late in the evening or in a dense woodland, where photo opportunities are low.At the beginning of this year, I promised myself that I would find a family of foxes and get some decent shots. You may not believe it, but I spent weeks studying Google Maps in search of the best spots in East Lothian that I would visit everything marked green or looking like an open space was in scope for investigation.As spring progressed, I started to become more and more lucky with foxes. I reached the point when I could see them almost each time I left the house. I have taken multiple images, but I was never happy with them, until one dayhellipIt was a sunny Saturday morning when I decided to go out and look for deer. I visited a local meadow and quickly spotted a roe deer buck which I decided to follow. I did not manage to take any photos of the deer because as soon as I rushed after him, a beautully coloured fox crossed my path. Every day thenceforth I was coming back home with more information about the fox that I found. Finally, I was rewarded with some lovely shots in the setting sun! This is something I was dreaming of for so long! These animals are fantastic and I have completely fallen for them .Now, with lockdown eased, I hope you will have a chance to spend more time outdoors and hopefully see some lovely foxes. Evenyou donrsquot spot them on your walk, donrsquot give up! Look for some signs which may indicate of their presence: fox pooor their underground burrow .Scats are usually easily identiable as they are twisted and contain bits of fur and bones. They are deposited at prominent spots such as on footpaths, stumps, posts or rocks. The den is nothing  but a circular hollow in the groundyou are brave enough to lower yourself and snf it, you will smell a strong and unpleasant scent. Foxes secrete this smelly odour to mark their territories but it also helps to distinguish iniduals . They also have scent glands on their feet, so they mark their well-used trails as they walk ndash this is quite helpful to effectively navigate at night.If you would like to share your fox sightings with me or advise about good photography spots, please get in touch. I will also be delighted to chat anything wildle, so please do come up to say helloyou see me out and about with my camera.Speak to you next month!www.zanslenswww.facebook zanslenswww.instagram zans_lenswww zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-lodged-crematorium-near-musselburgh","story":"East Lothian Council will now consider the project from the Westerleigh Group, a developer and operator of crematoria and cemeteries, with  facilities in England, Scotland and Wales.A single-storey crematorium, of around m internally, which would house a -seat chapel, is planned in the larger of two fields on the site.There would be a waiting room, accessible toilets, administration office, crematory, covered walkway and floral tribute area.Car parking providing  spaces, including six disabled accessible bays and an additional four spaces for staff parking, and memorial gardens are also planned.George Bell, regional manager for north and east from Westerleigh Group, said: \"There is a pressing need for a crematorium in East Lothian.\"East Lothian does not have a crematorium of their own and their residents currently have to travel long journeys into Edinburgh, through busy roads, to access a crematorium.\"The area already has a large population base and this is going to grow further in the coming years, with some signicant new housing developments being planned.\"If our planning application is successful, this new crematorium will also serve the wider Edinburgh City region.\"We pride ourselves on creating and maintaining crematoria which are welcoming, attractive places for remembrance and reflection, and which are true assets to their local communities.\"The teams at all our crematoria have proudly earned a reputation for providing exceptional care and support to local people, enabling families to remember, mourn and celebrate the lives of their loved ones in a way that is uniquely personal, and we look forward to hopefully being able to bring that same high level of service to the people of East Lothian.\"Earlier this year, we conducted a public consultation exercise and were delighted to receive a positive response.\"The full planning application has now been submitted and we hope to receive a decision in early autumn.\"The site of the proposed development is around  acres, located north of the village of Old Craighall.

Their enthusiasm is infectious as they delve into everything from langoustine fishing and the art of making whisky to witchcraft, ancient rituals and standing stones.Sweeping landscapes and dramatic aerial shots abound, but the best bits are when McTavish and Heughan are trundling along in their trusty campervan exchanging witty banter and mock barbs.Graham McTavish and Sam Heughan go langoustine fishing during their Scottish road trip for the TV series Men In Kilts.

He would just suddenly pop out a flask.Heughan, meanwhile, is clearly in his happy place talking about whisky. ldquoIt is such a strong part of Scottish heritage and culture, he says. ldquoThat was interesting to dig into.

Is that something they have experienced ldquoI think you are right, says McTavish. ldquoThere has been a change. Now, being from Scotland is something not to hide. Certainly, for my fatherrsquos generation, it was hard. You were often the butt of jokesyou were from Scotland. But not anymore.Heughan is in fervent agreement. ldquoAbsolutely. I think it is the reason I wanted to make the show, he says. ldquoSomething I noticed working on Outlander was obviously this huge lsquoOutlander effectrsquo of people being interested in Scotland and Scottish history.ldquoI remember when I was growing up there was [this idea of] a very dour Scotsman. It was dreich and dark, and we Scottish people put ourselves down ndash or used to.ldquoThere is this new positivity and, dare I say, itrsquos because of a strong identity and because we are a great little country and we have so much to celebrate. We are showing other parts of the UK how things should be done, maybe. It is certainly interesting.Over the series, they cover a lot of ground. Culloden, though, gets a big standalone episode to itself. This, says McTavish and Heughan, was something they felt passionately about.ldquoIt is a pivotal moment, not just in Scottish history but British history and arguably world history, says McTavish. ldquoYou see the ramications of Culloden.

Going to Culloden and having Iain MacGillivray play the pipes on the battlefield ndash those were standout moments for me.Heughan says they wanted to challenge some of the myths about the Culloden story. ldquoIt is a battle that most Scottish people have heard about, but they probably think the Scots got beaten by lsquothe Englishrsquo or the British, he says.ldquoAs Graham says, it was this huge pivotal moment that had repercussions all around the world. It is a fascinating story and one we wanted to tell.McTavish is warming to his subject. ldquoI think as well that Culloden represents somewhat of the distillation of the myth and romanticism of Scotland, which I was interested in exploring, he continues.ldquoBecause when Sam says the Scots and lsquothe Englishrsquo in inverted commas, of course, the reality was not that at all. It was Scots against Scots.ldquoThere were more Scots on the British side than there were on the Jacobite side. So, it is important, when you look at history, that you look at it and see what really happened ndash not just what you would like to have happened.\"That is something I think that we both learned about.

Those hillwalkers who do take the long single-track road down Glen Etive are usually intent on bagging the impressive Ben Starav.With every car park along the A through Glen Coe full to overflowing I decided I wanted a quiet day on the hill. I knew from past experience on Beinn Maol Chaluim that I neednrsquot go far in search of it.Glen Etive, unusually, was also busy but with paddlers not hillwalkers. Every little waterfall had half a dozen stubby, brightly coloured canoes waiting to take the plunge and the grass verges were full of cars and people camping for the Easter weekend. Despite the general air of busyness I was still confident of a quiet day on Beinn Maol Chaluim.A large herd of red deer grazed close to the road as I parked the car just past Inbhir-fhaolain opposite the wind-ruffled waters of Lochan Urr. I momentarily thought of dropping down from the road to the lochside to take a photograph of the twin Buachailles of Glen Etive with the loch as a foreground but being an extremely lazy photographer decided, conveniently, that the light was too flat.And it was. Dark clouds just tickled the summits of the highest peaks and it felt unseasonably cold. There was a greyness in the day that suggested that winter hadnrsquot quite yet finished with us.Despite the chill it didnrsquot take long to get sweating on the lower slopes of Creag na Caillich, en route to Beinn Maol Chaluimrsquos southern ridge.The slope is unrelentingly steep but the upside is that you can gain height quickly and within  minutes or so I was getting a hint of what the views were to be like later in the day. The twin Buachailles looked magnicent and behind me the steep slopes of Stob Dubh fell into the glen in one scree-scarred curtain. Further down the glen I caught the silver sparkle of Loch Etive, trapped in the cleft between triple-topped Ben Starav and Beinn Trilleachean. Once you reach the broad south ridge of Beinn Maol Chaluim only a steep, short and sharp climb separates you from the magnicent high level ridge that leads to the summit. Although steep, itrsquos straightforward enough until you reach the top of it.There, the summit ridge is protected by a long wall of vertical red porphyry. You can avoid these crags by traversing right for some distance but there are one or two breaches in the wall where even non-scramblers can clamber through.Beyond it some minor tops lead to the summit ridge itself, which is pleasantly narrow and today, was fringed with snow.What a marvellous high-level romp this produces ndash on one side steep slopes lead to another ridge that connects with the Munro of Sgorr na h-Ulaidh and on the other side even steeper slopes drop down into the bare fastness of Gleann Fhaolain, the narrow glen that separates Beinn Maol Chaluim from the Bidean nam Bian mass.I had harboured tentative thoughts about descending into Gleann Fhaolain, climbing steeply to Bidean, following its ridge east to Stob Coire Sgreamhach before descending back into Glen Etive, but dark clouds obscured Bidean and there appeared to be a dusting of new snow on the higher tops. Discretion being the better part of valourI loitered for a while beside the two summit cairns, dropped down out of the wind for a scenic lunch break, then ed to Glen Etive the way I had come.As a reward the sun shone for a while on the descent, illuminating some of the finest views yoursquoll see in this magnicently mountainous part of highland Scotland.

It is dficult to convey now a genuine sense of the ubiquity of drink and drunks in that era. I am not pointing a finger, for in doing so four would be pointing at me, but a couple of observations may serve to indicate the way we were.There is a hesitation in all of this because, first, a mate is compiling a history of a particular, celebrated newspaper pub and one doesnrsquot want to nick his best tales, but there are more than enough to go round.Second, there is laughter in drink but in newspapers it could be the soundtrack to impending doom much in the same style as the theme music to Jaws.

He regularly cashed cheques in the bar, made out to T McEntee. Such was the regularity of these transactions that he was once called for a personal interview with his bank manager who asked him with some concern: ldquoWho is T McEntee and why is he blackmailing you The presence of strong unions undoubtedly played a part in the existence and weary acceptance, by management, of this way of le. There is a narrative now that these working practices led to the financial problems that beset papers. They did not. They were not big, they were not particularly smart but newspapers in their physical form were battered by the internet, not drink or drinkers.The unions, too, held a power that was devastating. There were a iety of unions in the building and the non co-operation of just one could mean that no newspaper was produced while salaries had to be paid in full to the other union members.It led to a wary appreciation of the management of the rights of the worker and it produced excellent conditions and salaries.:Hugh MacDonald: Across the water and back to the past, the journey that leads me to childhoodThis all stumbled along nicely and mostly lucratively for employer and employee until Wapping in  when unions were crushed by Rupert Murdoch.

But stress in all industries in the st century is high because of the reality of job insecurity, constant change and a succession of UK governments that have legislated against workersrsquo rights.The one measurable certainty is that journalists, at least, are living longer.

The keyboard player ndash a founder member of Scottish bands, Friends Again and Love And Money ndash had taken a conscious decision to give up performing.As a producer and engineer, McGeechan had enjoyed considerable success working in virtual anonymity in his home studio on the outskirts of Glasgow. But in , a highly ambitious project to record a trilogy of albums ndash with a string of top vocalists ndash placed him centre stage again.ldquoSeveral years ago, I decided not to play at all. I guess I just fell out of it, he admitted.ldquoIrsquod worked with so many dferent singers and artistes on their own records, that I turned my back on the playing side of things altogether. It wasnrsquot intentional, it was just the way it happened. Irsquod also never really been a front person anyway. I donrsquot sing ndash certainly not in public ndash so I had to work with other people to do that for me.ldquoBut on this project, I got to record with many dferent artistes.:The Pearlfishers: Up With The Larks ndash Scotlands favourite albumsThe project was Starless, a series of collaborations with singers performing his music, accompanied by The Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. The small print of the album reads: ldquoConceived, realised and produced by Paul McGeechan.ldquoAfter Friends Again and Love And Money, I got out of performing and more into producing other people, he recalled.ldquoBut in , I thought, I quite fancy doing a record of my own. I had an accident where I lost a fingertip, so I gave up the idea and forgot all about it.ldquoThree years later, Love And Money decided to reform. Initially, it was just to do one gig at Celtic Connections, but it ended up being quite a few shows and we also went on to make an album, The Devilrsquos Debt.ldquoI didnrsquot even have any instruments. I had to go out and buy a new keyboard and learn to play again. That was the impetus that got me back into performing.ldquoItrsquos said you donrsquot really miss something until you do it again. In this instance, that turned out to be very true.ldquoI decided to rekindle the idea I had to do my own record. I began by asking a few musicianstheyrsquod like to get involved and they all said lsquoyesrsquo.Starless was released by German indie label, Marina Records. The tracks ndash a mix of original songs written by McGeechan, plus adaptations of traditional music ndash have a real cinematic feel. He chose vocalists such as Chris Thomson of The Bathers, who was a close friend and bandmate from Friends Again. Folk musicians Julie Fowlis, Karen Matheson and Kathleen MacInnes agreed to perform on the album.Gwen Stewart, ex-lead singer of Wild River Apples, Marie Claire Lee, Kaela Rowan and Andrew White also took part in the project.:Lloyd Cole, Madness, Eighties pop: A Week in RadioThe catalyst for Starless was a singer whose name was No on his wish list hellip Paul Buchanan of The Blue Nile.In music terms, the enigmatic genius behind the renowned Glasgow band rarely puts his head above the parapet.But McGeechan felt his voice would be perfect for the title song on the album.ldquoI had already recorded the track with Karen Matheson of Capercaillie. Gwen Stewart had also sung on a version of it, says McGeechan.ldquoBut I began to think,I could ask anyone on the Scottish music scene to sing this, who would it be ldquoI realised that maybe the song itself wasnrsquot for a female voice at all, it was perhaps more suited to a male singer.ldquoThe first name on my list was Paul Buchanan. I didnrsquot know him at all. Wersquod said a quick hello at a few s in the past, so our paths had crossed. But I loved The Blue Nile and really wanted to work with him.ldquoThere was a bit of nervousness about asking him to get involved. When we finally made contact he said: lsquoIf I like the song, Irsquom up for doing itrsquo.McGeechan admits it took  months to get the Starless project off the launch pad.:Billy Sloan: Associatesrsquo ground-breaking debut was both baffling and beguilingldquoI started off with lots of dferent pieces of music and bugged the hell out of Davie Scott of The Pearlfishers trying to gauge which would work best, he recalled.ldquoI was toying with the ious ideas for about a year ndash playing them to him ndash just trying to find a format for the record.ldquoIrsquom maybe not the most confident person when it comes to asking other artistes to get involved in my stuff. But as more agreed to take part, and the album began to take on a little bit of shape, I grew more assured.McGeechan recorded Buchanan singing a guide vocal for the song at his home studio in Bothwell. He admits the experience was both exciting and intimidating.ldquoPaul was standing behind me in the control room and it was very nerve wracking, he said.ldquoLater, when I had recorded the strings with the orchestra, we moved on to CaVa Studios in Glasgow to do the vocal track for real. When the engineer set everything up, Paul said: lsquoThis sounds brilliant hellip itrsquos like something from the movie, Blade Runnerrsquo.:Billy Connolly: lsquoIrsquom the only guy I know who died in a f*****g Muppet moviersquoldquoThat was perfect because one of my main influences was Vangelisrsquo soundtrack for the  film. Paul was so generous to work with. I had got my nerve by that time and think I pushed him quite hard in the studio. He tried out a few ideas and just did his thing. He nailed it right away. I love his vocal on the track and Irsquom proud to have had him do it for me.ldquoJust to hear Paul bring my music to le was a very emotional experience.ldquoIt also made asking other people to get involved a little easier.ldquoOnce Paul had agreed to sing on the album, everybody  was more than pleased to come on board. That was not the reason I asked him of course, but it certainly didnrsquot do any harm.McGeechan was reunited with friend Chris Thomson on the track Misty Nights, which also proved to be emotional.ldquoI suffer from insomnia and got up at am one morning and went into the studio, revealed McGeechan.ldquoI had the track more or less done in a few hours, with a few lyrical and melody ideas. I played what I had to my we and she said: lsquoWhy donrsquot you ask Chris to sing on that rsquoldquoEven though we go way back to school and the very early days of Friends Again, I hadnrsquot thought of that. Maybe sometimes yoursquore just too close to people. But it was a great suggestion.ldquoI sent Chris the tape with strict instructions that he was never to play my singing to anyone. My only other instruction was, use what you want and throw away what you donrsquot need.ldquoIt was the first time wersquod worked together for  years.ldquoHe had a few great lyrical ideas that reflected us growing up together and the people we both knew.ldquoTo hear him revisit our teenage years was very moving.The album was released to rave reviews. But McGeechan decided to raise the bar creatively on what was essentially a studio project.In , he showcased Starless at The Mitchell Theatre in Glasgow, as part of Celtic Connections.ldquoThat was an even bigger deal than I first thought. It was quite a thing to pull together because there was no permanent band, he said frankly.ldquoThe ious singers helped to draw an audience, but nobody really knew who I was or what Irsquod done previously.ldquoIt was pretty stressful, but on the day I just thought hellip wow.ldquoStarless was a long time in the making, from my initial idea to the album reaching the public. When you make a record, you stick it out and just hope people will somehow get to hear it and respond to your work.ldquoThe reaction was brilliant. People seemed to like it and that provided the momentum to move on to a second album.ldquoMaking the record was really enjoyable and I was fortunate to get so many great people involved.

It was a sobering story for hundreds of thousands who have lost relatives during the pandemic, or seen their livelihoods destroyed.This is, however, only the version of a man sacked by the PM. Many lining up to proclaim him as some kind of whistleblowing figure were enjoining us, just weeks ago and just as enthusiastically, not to believe a word he said. Whatrsquos more, in terms of political impact, the attention given to his testimony by the media is not matched by the UK electorate as a whole: most have hardly heard of him of those who have, only  per cent take a favourable view.The success of the vaccine programme ndash the one unqualied success of the pandemic ndash and the Conservativesrsquo double-digit lead in the polls tends to confirm the theory that what matters most in a crisis is how you emerge from it, and that voters, as a mass, forgive and forget earlier errors.Thatrsquos something from which not only the Tory Government at Westminster, but the SNP Government at Holyrood ndash whose handling of the crisis is open to similar criticisms, though it has received fewer ndash have benefited.The vague impression of most who are not already committed opponents of Boris Johnson or Nicola Sturgeon is that eithermay have made mistakes but have done well in the face of unprecedented circumstances. Those attitudes are wildly dferent between Perth and Penrith.If there is one thing about which Mr Cummings ndash no matter how dim a view of him you take ndash is undoubtedly right, however, it is that those easy assumptions will not do. Not merely because of the implied affront to those who have suffered tremendous loss, nor,there have been failings, of properly holding people to account. What matters even more is that, unless we learn from episodes such as this, there can be no hope of doing any better in the future.We need to begin to examine, right now, the failures that have cost lives and livelihoods. Mr Cummings castigated Matt Hancock, Englandrsquos Health Secretary, for claiming people were released into care homes after an unfulfilled promise they would be tested first. If that is true, it is a scandal. But the Scottish Government might bear in mind that it released into care homes people it actually knew were positive.Mr Cummings lambasted the Westminster Cabinet for not having a plan, but that criticism was also directed at SAGE, Public Health England, the WHO, and the Civil Service, all of whom have now been shown to have made many serious errors, and whose advice he admits largely determined policy.An uncontested bit of his testimony is that advice against quarantine, lockdown and masks until late March last year came from scientists and public health advisers ministers followed scientic advice, and Holyrood, by and large, followed suit.Since the Scottish Government also followed ldquothe science, it raises uncomfortable questions about what is to be done when scientists and their advisory bodies dfer in approach and advice ndash as, in the very nature of science, they almost always do.The First Minister, like the Prime Minister, seems to have emerged with the publicrsquos general approval. Both owe that to their personal presentation, popularity and public perception, eventhose dfer sharply on either side of Hadrianrsquos Wall.Itrsquos an imperfect view. Worse, it isnrsquot enough, because it doesnrsquot identy the policy errors that might impede real progress. We need the inquiry to begin now, not to apportion blame, but to understand where we went wrong, and make sure we donrsquot slip on the road towards recovery."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-taylor-nicola-sturgeon-want-pact-greens-meets-eye","story":"Sometimes, as with his own West Lothian Question, he would opt for attrition, pursuing Ministers endlessly.However, I preferred his approach succinct.

Eventually, there might be Green Ministers. For now, too soon.More to the point, the Greens stress they would reserve the right to dissent on certain specied issues. Which means no collective governmental responsibility. Which means no Ministers, for now.When  The talks are said to be at an early stage with months of discussion to come. Where  Holyrood.The big question, though, is why. One observer tells me that the Green co-leaders, Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, seemed faintly taken aback at the initial ldquotalks about talks. Warily and sensibly, they stressed the need to consult colleagues.However, they have agreed to continue negotiating, noting en passant that they have secured concessions in recent Budget deals.There is history here. In , Alex Salmond led a minority administration. He tried to strike a partnership deal with the Liberal Democrats. That fell apart: key LibDems found the SNP and independence fundamentally unpalatable.Mr Salmond then turned to the Green MSPs. All two of them. The leader Robin Harper, with his permanent smile and Dr Who scarf. And Patrick Harvie, an astute politician even then.Again, a full partnership proved impossible, owing to a dispute over transport policy among other issues. A compact was signed to support the election of Mr Salmond as First Minister.That was not really needed: subsequent history proved that the party with the most MSPs would, in practice, be permitted by Parliament to enter office.They said they had been sold short. Mr Swinney was, to put it mildly, less than pleased. That memory no doubt lingers in the mind of the Deputy First Minister as he contemplates the new round of talks.So, again, why  Especially now, when the SNP are just one short of an overall majority in Holyrood.I sought answers from my Herald Podcast  among the number, Kezia Dugdale, who formerly led Labour and now heads the John Smith Centre. She disclosed that she had conducted extensive research, including a phone call to a pal in New Zealand, where there has been cross-party co-operation.She was advised that the Greens there felt they gained clout and influence. Labour leaders felt they gained extra security, including a pact which obviated the need for tense annual Budget talks.:Is independence inevitable or can unionists rescue the realm they cherish The deal has persisted, even though Labour won a majority last year. Some Greens are discontented.Scottish Green sources point to the New Zealand model, stressing the capacity to criticise the administration. They are less enthusiastic about the example of Ireland where some Greens fear their ideology risks being swamped in a compact with centre-right parties.Either way, it is, partly, about money. Nicola Sturgeon and Kate Forbes want to pre-empt the annual agony of Budgetary negotiations by securing potential support in advance.Not an easy sell. SNP Ministers are adamant they will stick to an income tax freeze for the duration of this Parliament. Greens favour a more radical approach to revenue, as they would see it, including a possible wealth taxa way could be found.But compromise could be reached. There will be other obstacles, such as Green opposition to road building. The FM said this week that dualling the A, for example, will not be halted.Then there is the North Sea. The parties dfer over the pace of shting away from oil and gas. With the COP  UN climate conference due in Glasgow, the SNP may be ready to give yet more ground, while protecting north-east jobs.Always, of course, there is independence. Would a compact add more impetus to the case for indyref  Not, I suspect, in terms of influencing the UK Government. But it would perhaps be a reminder of the ersity of support for independence.There is, however, a third motivation, beyond cash and indyref. The SNP have been in power for  years. The previous Holyrood session had a toxic tang: Brexit independence arguments and Nicola Sturgeon gazing fretfully over her shoulder at her ever-present predecessor.I believe the FM wants a fresh approach. Literally, a new politics. Sceptics will say this is purely about presentation. I think it is also strategic. By making a choice, by making a new alliance, Ms Sturgeon hopes to banish staleness from her own party, and simultaneously challenge rivals to refresh.She hopes, in so doing, to isolate the Tories. They respond by warning that the Greens will push her in an anti-business direction.She hopes, also, to challenge Labour, over policy and indyref. Anas Sarwar was, understandably, ill-prepared. His first response was simply to revive an old Labour theme, deriding the recreation of a spending cuts coalition.He will need a new tone, new phrases.

His contempt for Hancock, and his comparison of the prime minister to an out-of-control shopping trolley echoed things he had said about other Conservative politicians.

A new campaign, The Sustainable Space Challenges, has been set up to explore and showcase the ability of the sector to support environmental efforts, with an online Summit planned in June that is open to the public.It is run by the Scottish Space Leadership Council, a body of professionals across industry, academia and government that seek to enable and promote the Scottish space sector as part of the wider UK proposition. Despite being voluntary, the Council has a history of successful initiatives, having recently set up the UK Spaceport Alliance with participation from developing Scottish launch sites, as well as those in Cornwall and Llanbedr, and the New Voices in Space working group, which calls for greater ersity across the sector.The Council also played a role in setting up the Space Academic Forum, which brings together Scotlandrsquos universities to provide valuable input into the SSLC. Kristina Tamane, Space Business Development Executive at the University of Edinburgh, has been organising this work as part of the SSLCrsquos Environmental Task Force, along with space entrepreneur and Scottish Space Leadership Council Co-Chair, Daniel Smith.ldquoThe idea behind the campaign was that we should engage with environmental groups, government, industrial partners and the universities to show how space can and should be sustainable, she explains. ldquoThe idea was that we should take on challenges to enable the sector to be thinking more sustainably and to make sure that we were developing in a greener way.Kristina points out that the popular perception of huge rockets blasting their way into the sky is not always correct ndash the UK private space sector is based around small launchers and highly miniaturised ldquocubesats. And she adds that space does now make an active contribution to global sustainability.ldquoSatellites can look at things like precision agriculture, deforestation, climate change, disaster relief, and bioersity management from space. The instruments they have onboard and the data generated can generate positive environmental impacts.ldquoThere is also work going on across the sector to make the supply chains needed more sustainable, for example through greener rocket fuels and taking a mobile approach to launch. We are proactively working to explore ways for the sector to be more sustainable.With space debris a growing problem, it is important to protect outer space as well as the planet, she adds. ldquoWe need to start viewing near earth orbit as part of our environment, as we rely on so many services that come from space and must look after it.After receiving many submissions from schools to businesses to environmental groups, three challenges were grouped together by a judging . The first of these is to quanty, classy and assess how many humanmade objects are in space so the nature of the debris can be understood.The second is to measure the direct and indirect impacts of the whole sector on the environment, while the third is to develop a digital library of space data to connect with citizen science initiatives and help inform decision making. The judging rsquos selection led to a series of ongoing workshops to encourage proactive engagement between environmental groups, government and wider industry stakeholders for the purpose of exploring solutions to the challenges.The aim is to identy new opportunities to make a positive contribution to net zero targets. SSLC Co-Chair Daniel Smith says that the judging  had to be as independent as possible.ldquoWe invited as many environmental organisations as we could think of, as well as speaking with the likes of the Scotch Whisky Association, who have recently been through a similar process of addressing sustainability head-on. We were pleased when Friends of the Earth Scotland, NatureScot and Scottish Enterprise decided to get involved.ldquoWe were also delighted to secure participation from the European Space Agency, an organisation with  member states that is currently developing a Charter around the sustainable use of space.Members of the workshops have been joining with solution providers in an attempt to provide answers to each of the challenges. ldquoWe are already coming up with some interesting outcomes, says Kristina. The hope is that partners can be found to take specic projects forward, with the Summit in June expected to attract investors looking to support some of the ideas that are being explored.The outcomes from all the workshops will be publicly presented to an online audience on June , hosted by broadcaster Dallas Campbell and Dr. Suzie Imber. This event will also highlight the importance of ongoing collaboration and establish the next steps to be taken.Smith explains, ldquoWersquore really keen to engage as broad an audience as possible at the Summit in June, this is not just about the space sector. Looking forward, wersquore aiming to share findings at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow later this year, as well as other major crosssectoral events such as World Expo Dubai.ldquoThere is no doubt that environmental groups appreciate the benefits of data from space, particularly around Earth observation. ldquoThe vital work they do relies on space, like so many industries. What we felt was important was to proactively reach out to those groups to encourage productive collaboration to help the space industry source such data in a sustainable way.ldquoThere is an opportunity to be the first country to focus on the importance of sustainable spaceflight, and that distinguishing factor gives us a competitive advantage. Satellite manufacturers, launch vehicles and launch sites in the UK are thinking about how to make their operations greener ndash and thatrsquos exciting.Derek Harris, Business Operations Manager at the Edinburgh space technology company Skyrona, is involved in the workstream on the first challenge. ldquoWhen I heard about the opportunity to get involved, I had to ensure we were representedrsquo, he says.ldquoTo sit across the virtual table from charities and academia and hear their concerns about the industry was invaluable. I feel this is the best way forward for the emerging UK space sector to bring all parties closer while encouraging positive discussions on social and environmental responsibilities.Workshop  lead, Hina Khan of Spire, stated: ldquoThe Challenge  workshop focused on firstly considering how to measure the impact the space sector has on the environment, before discussing the steps required to reduce carbon emissions and work towards net zero targets. The vibrant discussion identied the great work already happening in the sector, from the environmental considerations undertaken at dferent spaceport sites, to emissions reporting. There is still a long way to go, but contributors are considering solutions and ways forward to make the sector more sustainable in the long run.And Sue Kee, Head of Business Development, Missions and Services at the Glasgow small satellite provider AAC Clyde Space who is working on the third challenge, comments: ldquoOur discussions have been really insightful and productive. ldquoWe have identied the global opportunity for Scotland to lead the way towards net zero and the need for a coherent national approach to data sharing to support environmental initiatives.The Sustainable Space Summit is free to attend.For more information, visit www. scottishspace.org---------------------LAST month, the NASA helicopter Ingenuity became the first aircraft to perform a powered controlled flight on a planet besides Earth, when it performed a series of short but emotional demonstration flights on Mars, writes Dr. Nicholas Ross of AstroAgency.For anyone that has seen the videos of Ingenuity, you feel therersquos something really special, and also a fair bit sentimental watching that wee helicopter take-off, hover, disappear out of the picture and then . Alongside the dual-blade helicopter, the other part of the NASA Mars  mission is the car-sized Perseverance rover, which has a suite of on-board laboratory instruments and cameras that are investigating the Martian surface and atmosphere.One key component that led to the successful landing of the rover and the flight of the helicopter is the on-board computing. Specically, Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs, are fast becoming a mainstay of spaceflight hardware.There are several FPGAs powering the cameras on Perseverance, and there is an FPGA at the heart of the electronics on Ingenuity. An FPGA is an integrated circuit that is ldquofield-programmable ndash meaning that it is designed to be configured after being manufactured. Nothing actually physically changes when doing the field programming, all the changes are done digitally to create new hardware interactions.With the benefits of being reprogrammable and having a low power consumption, FPGAs are very well suited to long missions in deep space where you need to upgrade the firmware from a distance as the mission progresses. FPGAs can also be designed and built to be radiation tolerant, and indeed, incorporating the FPGA and the associated FPGA board hardware to meet the challenges of an extreme operating environment is a critical step.While not directly involved in the NASA Mars  Perseverance and Ingenuity mission, Scottish technology companies are at the forefront of using FPGAs in space. Edinburgh-based Alpha Data is one such example. Building on  years of experience in deploying reliable FPGA-based solutions to the aerospace sector, Alpha Data has recently joined the growing number of Scottish companies that are powering the supply chain for next-generation space products.The success of Ingenuityrsquos demonstration flights have led to an extended mission with new test flights every  to  weeks until at least the end of August. Meanwhile, the utility and use of FPGAs in space only looks set to grow with the space market in general.This article was brought to you in association with AstroAgency"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12654163.jpg?type=article-full","title":"elevator-ensures-scotlands-rural-firms","story":"In fact,it has huge potential for dynamic business growth. According to Scotlandrsquos leading private sector organisation supporting entrepreneurship, the rural economy is in many ways ideal for generating dynamic new companies and innovative thinking.Elevator UK, the social enterprise charged with supporting the business leaders of today and tomorrow, sees it as an ideal environment for encouraging new business growth and development. It is now committed to expanding its operational activities across the  per cent or so of Scotlandrsquos land area designated as rural.According to Rachel Ross, the organisationrsquos Rural Development Director, it is the fact that the population is small and dispersed that actually creates an entrepreneurial culture. ldquoItrsquos not as easy to access support in rural areas as it is in urban ones, so you will find that quite a lot of people have businesses and do more than one thing, she explains. ldquoOn an island for instance, as well as running their own enterprise, people might work part time with the leboat or at the fire station.ldquoThat means therersquos a propensity to be entrepreneurial. We want people in rural parts of Scotland to have the same access to support you can find in a city ndash to connect with the specialist advice and the big names that can talk to you about how you can grow your business.The key to this, of course, is connectivity. The topography of places like the Highlands mean that high quality digital infrastructure is not yet ubiquitous, but it is a lot better than it used to be and this opens the door to growing the business networks that are needed. The key to providing support is the creation of rural enterprise hubs and community hub satellites. These can offer the facilities for local people to work, meet each other, hold events and connect digitally with workshops and mentoring sessions at larger centres in urban areas.Elevator UK is currently working to build out this network. ldquoEvery regional economy across the globe that is flying has a central place within it that draws entrepreneurs to learn, says Professor Gary McEwan, its CEO, who is a former UK Entrepreneur of the Year and winner of a Queenrsquos Award for Enterprise Promotion.ldquoWersquove copied that model here and created Centres for Entrepreneurship. These have become beacons attracting like-minded people to share ideas and build peer groups that grow companies.ldquoOur strategy shows that itrsquos working and achieving tangible results ndash Aberdeen now produces around  per cent of Scotlandrsquos startups despite only having  per cent of the population.ldquoWersquove now opened a small enterprise hub as a pilot project in Fraserburgh, which is by any definition a rural economy, and connected it to our Aberdeen and Dundee centres. Itrsquos allowed local people to achieve a level of education that would otherwise be very dficult to provide in a rural area.The aim is now to create a network of these smaller hubs to provide, as Professor McEwan puts it, ldquoa local heartbeat. He adds: ldquoThey will be somewhere that people can gravitate towards where they can connect into something bigger, get a world class education and be part of something really quite special.The future Scotland-wide network, he explains, willat three levels. At the top will be the Centres for Entrepreneurship, with the current operations in Aberdeen and Dundee soon to be joined by a third at the University of the West of Scotland campus in Hamilton, Lanarkshire. The next layer will be rural enterprise hubs based in towns with populations of about , to , around the country.ldquoOur focus for these to start with is likely to be the south of Scotland, says Rachel Ross. ldquoWe are already working in North and South Lanarkshire and plan to expand this work further into the south of Scotland. We are in conversation with South of Scotland Enterprise and the Scotland G Centre about its plans for rural connectivity. There are a lot of interesting developments at the moment, including the new rural G Centre in Dumfries, that will expand the potential for rural businesses to be entrepreneurial and grow.The third level, satellite hubs, may well be mobile and even pop-up operations where small community-run hub facilities are already in place.ldquoIt may be a case of booking space in local centres, Ms Ross says. ldquoThey wouldnrsquot necessarily operate five days a week ndash it might be two and a half days a fortnight. They would all be connected digitally. If we used a mobile enterprise van, it would have high-speed satellite capability. By doing this we could, for instance, run a workshop on the climate emergency from Aberdeen and it could be accessed by people on the Isle of Jura.The aim is not to rush out a broad Scotland-wide network of rural entrepreneurship centres but rather to let them grow organically. As well as the south of Scotland, other early options may include Tayside and Aberdeenshire Rachel Ross says that funding for the expansion is available from a iety of dferent sources. Scottish Government support can be accessed along with financial assistance from the UK Governmentrsquos Shared Prosperity Fund.In addition, partnerships may be struck with other agencies such as the Scotland G Centre, the national hub for the adoption of the latest mobile broadband technology. ldquoAccess to broadband in rural areas still isnrsquot universal and thatrsquos a challenge we face, but in the short-termwe can bring people into a local centre which does have super-fast access and is within perhaps  minutes of where people live, that will be a huge stepping stone.ldquoHaving said that, itrsquos still critical for Scotlandrsquos future economy that we have broadband connectivity that is accessible by  per cent of the people for  per cent of the time.Joining up the country in this way, she adds, anyone can be an entrepreneur and access support anywhere is the key to obtaining sustained economic growth that is location agnostic.ldquoAt Elevator UK, we do have the capability to provide the entrepreneurial ecosystem that is required. We are ambitious to do that ndashnot just for ourselves, but for the businesses that we are supporting. The thought of so many dferent places in Scotland being able to come together and make this work is hugely exciting.

Cummings was part of it too. He admitted he didnrsquot advise the PM to seriously consider lockdown until it was already too late.Cummings also saved the bacon of the hapless Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, by accusing him of repeatedly lying. Boris Johnson was forced to back his Cabinet minister, thus saving him from the chop in the forthcoming cabinet reshuffle.Cummings may also have done the PM a favour by helping expose the hypocrisy of Nicola Sturgeon. Her claims to have handled the pandemic better are now sounding distinctly hollow. She can expect a flurry of compensation claims following the admission that the Scottish Government failed to protect elderly patients in care homesIt was a quite a performance. No wonder Boris Johnson practically purred at Prime Ministerrsquos Questions on the day The Dom lobbed his self-destructive hand grenades. Not so much Independence Day as the Great Escape.I felt almost sorry for the dark lord as he exposed his personality disorders in what almost became an Oprah-style confessional. Cummingsrsquos most revealing moment came right at the start when he nearly broke down while delivering an apology to those who died needlessly. He is clearly a troubled man.But he squandered it all by a display of arrogance, ignorance, pettiness, vanity, malevolence. Of unreliability and disloyalty ndash not just to Boris Johnson, who stood by him over Barnard Castle, but to the civil servants, scientists, ministers whose trust he betrayed to no good purpose.It is fine to be a whistleblower ndash provided you know how to blow it.In more competent hands Cummingsrsquos evidence, especially about Johnsonrsquos dithering over the second lockdown last autumn, might have done real damage. But his accusations either missed their target or rebounded. Not least when Cummings declared that everyone at a senior level in government was ldquocrackers ndash including himself.The main charge against Boris Johnson has always been that the PM was reckless, uncaring and throughout the pandemic, putting the interests of the economy above human lives. That he wilfully ignored scientic advice and thought we should just ldquotake it on the chin. Cummings made clear that, on the contrary, Johnsonrsquos failings were a reflection of a dysal civil service run by amateurs and by a scientic community which was fighting the wrong pandemic. It was chaos, from top to bottom. Whitehall said it had a plan but didnrsquot. The Governmentrsquos scientic advisers thought they were dealing with flu. No-one ndash Cummings included ndash advised the PM to take any serious action, such as quarantine and closing the borders, until mid-March. Even then the borders were not closed for fear it would look ldquoracist. Large gatherings like Cheltenham were allowed to continue.In hindsight, Johnsonrsquos scientic advisers should have learned from the prompt action taken by some Asian countries like South Korea that had experienced the Sars and Mers outbreaks. But the point was: they didnrsquot. Cummings underlined that international agencies ndash like the World Health Organisation and the US Centres for Disease Control ndash were also slow off the mark.Even after the pandemic was recognised as such in March , the consensus on the Scientic Advisory Group on Emergenciesand in Whitehall was that, in the absence of a vaccine, the disease had to be allowed to ldquowork its way through the population until herd immunity was achieved. The aim, as Cummings explained it, was to seek immunity by the autumn, to avoid a second wave in winter.This was all wrong, of course. Coronavirus was much more contagious and lethal than flu. But Cummings portrayed this as a collective failure that could not solely be laid at the door of the PM however ldquounfit he thought he was was for office. He even quoted the Cabinet Secretary at the time, Mark Sedwill, advocating a Covid version of ldquochickenpox parties to help spread immunity.Cummings should have pleaded the Fth because he then incriminated himself. In January and February , he did nothing. He didnrsquot even attend Cobra meetings, didnrsquot advise lockdown, didnrsquot even discuss what lockdown meant seriously until that infamous ldquoIndependence Day meeting on March  in Downing Street. That was when his whiteboard told him disaster was imminent and that the PM needed a ldquoPlan B. Unfortunately, the then-Deputy Cabinet Secretary Helen McNamara burst in saying ldquotherersquos no Plan B ndash wersquore absolutely f****d.The next day, March , Cummings still did not call on the PM to impose a full Wuhan-style lockdown. He was just ldquotoo scared that I might be wrong. Anyway, he said, SAGE ldquohad not modelled any kind of lockdown because it was still labouring under the logic of herd immunity.Yetthere was no Plan B, who might be thought to be at least partly responsible for that,not the most influential adviser in government: Dominic Cummings  He had even blogged about the dangers of coronavirus pandemics before entering government.I ended up agreeing with Boris Johnson: chaos would indeed be better than putting this monomaniac in charge of anything. Cummings even said that, given his choice, he would have put a ldquodictator in charge of the pandemic.It doesnrsquot take a genius now to forecast what the official inquiry is going to say whenever it reports. There was a systemic failure to plan going back several administrations. The scientic advisers, and Whitehall, failed to appreciate just how deadly Covid- was. The Prime Ministerrsquos advisers, from Cummings down, failed to alert him until it was too late. Lessons will be learned etc.Prime ministers are not scientists, they rely on advice from civil servants, special advisers and medical experts. Cummings even distanced Johnson from the most serious scandal of all: the deaths of some , care home residents. Cummings pinned that on Matt Hancock who, he said, lied about testing elderly patients before they were decanted from acute wards. Hancock says he didnrsquot promise anything of the sort.Nicola Sturgeon may regret jumping on the Cummings bandwagon and accusing Johnson of being responsible for ldquoloss of le. Some , old people were decanted from Scottish hospitals during the first wave, many without a test. Compensation lawyers are already sharpening their writs.As this column has pointed out before, the Scottish Government made all the same mistakes ndash it did not lock down early enough, halted community testing, neglected care homes. The Scottish excess death rate is one of the worst in Europe. Ms Sturgeon accused Johnson of failing to impose a circuit-breaker lockdown in the autumn. But she didnrsquot impose a full lockdown then either.Perhaps she now needs a Cummings figure to help spread the blame.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

They did not have an easily explainable pattern. And so, you know, I think that people still take seriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is.The renewed interest in UFOs and aliens comes just days before the US defence and intelligence agencies are due to deliver a report on these mysterious sightings.

He asked the then-director of national intelligence and the Secretary of Defense to provide an unclassied report by next month.ldquoAnything that enters an airspace thatrsquos not supposed to be there is a threat, Rubio said.In January, a website that archives declassied government documents, the Black Vault, published thousands of declassied CIA documents on UFOs.In August last year, the Pentagon resurrected a programme to collect and analyse information on mystery objects, and encouraged military members to report strange encounters to the task force.Luis Elizondo was part of the Pentagonrsquos earlier version of this group, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identication Program , from  to .He told the US programme  Minutes that while there were simple explanations for some sightings, others were inexplicable and baffled physics. ldquoIs it some sort of new type of cruise missile technology that China has developed  h asked.Elizondo added: ldquoIs it some sort of high-altitude balloon thatrsquos conducting reconnaissance  Ultimately when you have exhausted all those what s and yoursquore still left with the fact that this is in our airspace and itrsquos real, thatrsquos when it becomes compelling, and thatrsquos when it becomes problematic.And in March, John Ratclfe, Donald Trumprsquos former intelligence director, said the forthcoming report would reveal there have been ldquoa lot more sightings of UFOs than have been made public.Falkirk TriangleTHERE could hardly be more sightings than in the so-called Falkirk Triangle, which stretches from the small town of Bonnybridge, where Buchanan is a councillor, east to Fe and then back to Stirling. There are about  sightings a year which,you are a cynic, almost amounts to mass hysteria.The first sighting was in  when a local businessman called James Walker was driving from Falkirk to Bonnybridge. He pulled up his car as a bright, star-shaped obstacle was blocking his path, hovering over the road, before it shot off at incredible speed. Others have claimed to have been kidnapped and examined by aliens before being ed. But why Bonnybridge  Is it some interstellar interchange, or is the Falkirk Triangle a window into another dimension Given the number of craft spotted, the council should impose some kind of congestion charge, although enforcement might be problematic.Allegations of kidnapping by aliens are not so unusual. In , the writer Michael Shermer, who wrote the Skeptic column for Scientic American and was no ufologist, was cycling along a lonely rural road in Nebraska.He describes what happened: ldquoA large craft with bright lights overtook me and forced me to the side of the road.ldquoAlien beings exited the craft and abducted me for  minutes, after which time I found myself back on the road with no memory of what transpired inside the ship. I can prove that this happened because I recounted it to a film crew shortly afterward.He had been cycling for  straight hours, , miles in the opening days of the ,-mile nonstop transcontinental Race Across America. He was exhausted and when his support crew in a motor home flashed lights and him urging him to take a break, in a hallucinogenic state they became transformed into aliens, in which memories of the s television series The Invaders were incorporated into his waking dream.ldquoBut at the time the experience was real, and thatrsquos the point. The human capacity for self-delusion is boundless, and the effects of belief are overpowering, he said.Numerous theoriesThis does not explain how two people could hold the same imagined abduction, like Garry Wood and his friend Colin Wright who were driving along the A between Edinburgh and Tarbrax in .The journey should have taken  minutes ndash but they turned up an hour-and-a-half late. Under hypnosis, Wood recalled being scooped up into disc-shaped craft and examined by a ft-plus alien with a large head and dark eyes with a long, slender neck, very slim shoulders and waist. A hoax  A far-fetched excuse It certainly canrsquot explain footage, taken by civil aircraft and the military, of objects in the sky travelling at speeds unattainable by earthly machines, or hand-break turning in the sky defying the laws of physics.In a laboratory at Glasgow University, Professor LeroyCronin and his colleagues have come up with a new theory ndash that the study of complex molecules holds the secret to discovering aliens. In a paper published this month in Nature Communications, he and his team describe their ldquoassembly theory, a new way of quantying molecular complexity, which can be used to determinea molecule required a biological system to create it.He said: ldquoItrsquos based on the idea that only living systems can produce complex molecules that could not form randomly in any abundance. This allows us to sidestep the problem of defining le ndash instead we focus on the complexity of the chemistry.In tandem with Nasa, the Glasgow team is trying to make new le detection instruments which could be sent on missions to discover alien le. They could kick off in Bonnybridge!They point out that assembly theory ldquorelies on molecular complexity alone, the le detection process is agnostic, with no assumptions that alien le will be chemically similar to le on Earth.As Mr Spock almost said: ldquoItrsquos le Jim, but not as we know it.Perhaps we will know more when the US report is published."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-greatest-historian-explains-exactly-union-peril","story":"Scotland’s greatest historian explains exactly why the union is in periletmMillennium MemoriesSCOTLAND is at an historic crossroads. Therersquos a Holyrood mandate for a second referendum, facing an absolute lsquoNorsquo from Westminster. In the eyes of Scotlandrsquos most renowned historian, Sir Tom Devine, the union hasnrsquot been under such strain since the Jacobite risings were crushed.In a bid to unravel where Scotland now stands, in terms of the history of the union, the Herald on Sunday sat down with Professor Devine. Over two hours of conversation, the worldrsquos leading authority on Scottish history gave what amounts to a personal lecture for Herald on Sunday readers.BIRTH PAINSldquoLetrsquos start at the beginning, Devine says, ldquoin . The treaty was a union of partnership - thatrsquos very relevant to whatrsquos happening today.However, for the first  years ldquothere was no certainty that it would prevail in terms of a stable relationship. Aside from Jacobitism, there were two big problems: increased taxation due to Englandrsquos wars with France, and the ldquoviolation of the treaty by the Patronage Act of  which interfered with the way the church was run. Both fomented early tension and ldquohostility.Of course the main threat was ldquoJacobitism, the attempt by some elements of Scottish society to reverse the revolution of  [when the Catholic Stuart king, James II, was overthrown by Protestant William of Orange] and restore the Stuart dynasty.Although the Jacobites are remembered mostly for opposition to the Hanoverian regime, there was also, says Devine, a strong degree of ldquodisaffection from the union. Both matters were the cause of four ldquovery serious risings between  and the most famous of all .:Opinion: Throughout the pandemic Boris Johnson has had to battle with himselfMONEY, MONEY, MONEYAnti-unionism was driven mostly by economics. ldquoOne of the prime arguments made by those propagandising before the union was that it would bring bounty, says Devine. Scotland was promised ldquoan economic miracle, and after famine in the s and the financial disaster of the failed Darien expedition to establish a Scottish colony in Panama the idea of union with England ldquowas a powerful argument. You may be giving up your sovereignty but yoursquore getting economic goodies.However, the economic miracle didnrsquot happen. Scotland simply ldquodidnrsquot have the capacity to take advantage of the opportunities offered by union because the country wasnrsquot yet mature enough in material terms to exploit it.Both Jacobitism, and general dissatisfaction with the union, were partly driven by ldquoa revolution of frustrated expectations. Devine says ldquothere were Jacobite banners not simply proclaiming the Stuart dynasty but saying no to the union. There were many elements in the army of Charles Edward Stuart [Bonnie Prince Charlie] at Culloden who were not only opposed to the Hanoverians but also the union.Northeast Scotland, parts of the Highlands and islands, and parts of the southwestern border were ldquounambiguously anti-union. Anti-unionism was also ldquocommonplace in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Clearly, the Act of Union wasnrsquot agreed by the Scottish people - the event took place in a ldquopre-democratic society.Taxation, English interference in the Kirk, and the failure of the economic miracle to materialise all added to the ldquoinevitable growing pains of a union between two ancient enemies. There were three parties in parliament - the Jacobite Cavaliers, the Court party representing the establishment pushing for union, and the anti-union Country party which was out of power. There was broad parliamentary consent for the economic parts of the treaty, but dissent on most other elements. Riots broke out in Edinburgh as ldquothe street sided with anti-unionists in parliament.WAR AND SECURITYFrance - Englandrsquos great rival for world domination - saw the union ldquobolstering the power of its enemy, as it closed a backdoor to England in future wars. England, meanwhile, saw union as a national security imperative, protecting its northern border. With England emboldened militarily through partnership with Scotland, the union ldquohastened the intensity of the long wars with France until Britain emerged victorious at the end of the Napoleonic Wars in .Therersquos lesson to be learned in  from the early days of union. Scotland wasnrsquot ldquoannexed by conquest like Wales and Ireland, says Devine. ldquoIt was a partnership agreement and that partnership agreement has now been lost, and lost very recently. David Cameronrsquos granting of a referendum was an example of that partnership operating - he was quick to acknowledge the right of Scots to determine their own future, unlike his successor in Downing Street today.Devine believes thata second referendum happens ldquothe core weakness for those who wish Scottish independence will be economics, the same way economics caused dficulties in the first half of the th century.Debates today about currency, trade with England and ldquowhat kind of advantages and disadvantages would flow economically from independence ldquoecho some of the issues swirling around in the late th and early th centuries.:Poll finds only one fth of English voters oppose Scottish independenceTHE RISINGSIronically, the Jacobite risings helped secure the union. With expectations disappointed over the promised economic miracle, the threat of a successful Jacobite rebellion, which would have heralded theof Catholicism, ldquodisciplined pro unionists who were fed up with the way the union was going. Those who had a tepid commitment to the union - and given the religious make-up of Scotland theyrsquod have iniably been Protestant - were forced to group together. Those who were becoming increasingly anxious that the union wasnrsquot delivering could never have sided with those trying to break the union as that would have legitimised the forces of Catholicism. If Jacobitism didnrsquot exist, the union may have been in greater danger.That split in Scotland has echoes today. In the early s, ldquoabout a third of the population was probably anti-union. Today, Devine notes, itrsquos about -. Fear over isions, he says, will play a part in any future referendum, with unionists warning that ldquosuch a bitterly ided country is no basis for building a new nationYes won.The shaky early history of the union quickly changed, though, after the risings. By the mid th century, says Devine, ldquothe union was entirely unproblematic. How did such a sundered country unite so quickly Jacobitsim was ldquorooted out to such an extent by military and legislative means that it never recovered. By the late th century ldquoitrsquos become part of history. Jacobitism became sentimentalised in songs and Walter Scott novels. ldquoThat sentimentalisation, says Devine, ldquois the clearest example that it was beaten. If it had remained dangerous that sentimentalisation wouldnrsquot have occurred.BOOM TIMEHighland culture and power was also crushed, most famously in the Clearances. The Highland warrior was coopted into the British army, becoming a fabled part of empire after Waterloo.More importantly, though, than this pacication of the Highlands and destruction of Jacobitism was money. Scotlandrsquos ldquogreat lt off began. The country started industrialising at a remarkable rate. There was also a revolution in agriculture and mass urbanisation. ldquoThe material benefits promised by union began arriving in spades, says Devine. ldquoScotland began to feel at ease in the union.Scotlandrsquos economic revolution ldquowas the fastest and most decisive in Europe. Englandrsquos industrialisation built up over time, while in Scotland therersquod been ldquohardly any change until the mid th century when the economy exploded. ldquoThere was nothing like it in Europe until forced industrialisation in the Soviet Union, Devine said.It was this growth of wealth and industry which helped settle Scotland firmly into union. ldquoIt draws the poison of disaffection, Devine says. This accommodation with union was ldquoso complete by the s that some Scottish intellectuals feared total anglicisation, Devine explains. ldquoThere was a fear that the battle for economic development had been won at the cost of Scotlandrsquos identity.But lsquoScottishnessrsquo wasnrsquot destroyed, Devine says. Therersquos no ldquovictory of Britishness over Scottishness, rather a ldquohybrid identity of Britishness and Scottishness emerges.EMPIRE BUILDINGPatriotism remained, but Scotland was ldquothe most unnationalistic country in the world. While the great empires of Europe fell apart, Scotland ldquowas congratulating itself on being part of the British empire. The nation fully embraced the business of empire and colonialism.Another historical irony was that come the mid-th century, when Scotland was so thoroughly part of empire and union, there was almost a sense of ldquosemi-independence in terms of how the country was governed. Clearly, Westminster was sovereign, says Devine, but there was a tradition in parliament that Scottish MPs decided the ldquorelevant bills for the country - theyrsquod be put before parliament and hardly ever opposed. Scotland was also governed on a daily basis by lsquoScots in Scotlandrsquo when it came to the law, religion, education, hospitals, poor laws, and prisons.ldquoEngland was prepared to be tolerant, to stand back. There was no friction between the two countries because of Englandrsquos restraint. England refused to occupy more than its share of the marital bed.Another ldquodelicious historical irony, says Devine, is that now ldquothe situation is reverse hellipyou compare the mid-th century to Boris Johnsonrsquos union today there was arguably more Scottish control of its own business, apart from issues like macro economic policy, foreign policy and making war.ldquoAnother paradox, says Devine, is that with Scotland today ldquobeholden to England because of the Barnett formula it now experiences increased interference. The classic example is Brexit. It was the reverse of the kind of government that existed between England and Scotland in the th century because it exemplies, more than anything  in the entire history of the union, England using its weight and power to force through a decision overwhelmingly opposed by Scotland.VICTORIAN VALUESUnionism in the Victorian era was ldquobenign. The state wasnrsquot interventionist, and with no security threat from Scotland, England ldquodidnrsquot really care too much about what was going on north of the border.Against this backdrop, Scotland and England began the business of empire building as a ldquojoint partnership. Devine says: ldquoThe old aphorism is true: England ruled the empire and Scotland ran it hellip the two countries were bound in that imperial project. These bonds deepened in the th centuryrsquos two world wars which ldquobound the countries together in blood.The period throughout most of the th century until the collapse of the British empire after the Second World War was the high point of union, when ideas of SNP nationalism belonged to a ldquofringe sect.The end of empire signalled that ldquoBritain was no longer great, and was followed by a ldquoseries of economic catastrophes like the crises of the s which paved the way for Margaret Thatcher, and policies which ldquoalienated Scotland.Scotlandrsquos iconic industries collapsed - coal, steel, shipbuilding. For Scotland, trade with the empire was replaced by trade with England. Devine says hersquos more skeptical than most historians about linking the end of empire to the growth of nationalism - symbolised by Winnie Ewingrsquos  Hamilton by-election win - but the events of the latter half of the th century certainly created a sense ldquoof introspection in Scotland, the sense that a more ldquoScottish centred future was needed, fuelled in part by concerns over the increasing importance, and dominance, of the economic relationship with England.SNP ASCENDANTHowever, the rise of the SNP still ldquowasnrsquot inevitable. Things changed when Tony Blairrsquos Labour administration created the Scottish parliament. The idea that rather than ldquokilling off nationalism, Labour actually built its own gallows in Scotland through devolution is ldquovery pertinent, says Devine.At the same time, identity politics was on the rise and many were growing disenchanted with globalisation. ldquoThatrsquos a very important factor stoking nationalism, says Devine. People were becoming uneasy with the power of the large state. ldquoThey wanted more control, he says. This also played into growing criticism of the EU culminating in England quitting Europe.More importantly, though, was ldquothe apparent inability of successive British governments to cure Scotlandrsquos economic problems. Another irony, however, is that while economic discontent ran alongside the growth in nationalism, once the painful transformation of the s and s was over, Scotlandrsquos economy today has emerged in better shape than itrsquos been for a long time, says Devine.Once the SNP won its  majority, the path was laid for a referendum. Devine says the fact that support for Yes hasnrsquot disintegrated is crucial. ldquoIf there was another referendum the chances of Yes winning are now much greater.TORY DISRESPECTHowever, the other crucial factor is that the Tory Party today is ldquounlike any British government since the early th century. After breaking Labourrsquos Red Wall, itrsquos almost ldquohegemonic.Therersquos been a ldquoshattering effect on many Scots who ldquodidnrsquot want to leave their friends behind in Tory dominated Englandthey went down the independence road, says Devine. With the Tories seemingly unassailable ldquothatrsquos now changed.The most important historic change of all, though, is the attitude of the Tories in government. ldquoSince the early th century therersquos been no instance of such a brazen refusal to accept Scottish opinion as Brexit. Judged in the long history of the union, this is an extraordinary volte face. The word lsquodisrespectrsquo isnrsquot strong enough.Devine added: ldquoWhatrsquos preserved the union has been good management by England - as the dominant party. It was a policy of respect and restraint by the big elephant in the bed. Scotland is now in danger of getting pushed out of bed. The future is not my period, butindependence does come then the killer of union will be more England not Scotland, because of the abandonment of that system of restraint, partnership and respect.He added: ldquoThe governing party in England is a dferent Tory party to even the Thatcher years. Itrsquos much more right-wing. Something has happened which never existed until after : the rapid growth of English nationalism. He points to polls showing a majority of Tories happy to see the union crumble to save Brexit.ldquoThe Conservative party, which was the classic defender of union throughout its existence, can no longer be trusted to preserve the union because of the growth of this Little Englandism. Many of its supporters see Scotland as an ungrateful liability as they assume theyrsquore giving privileges out of their taxes to the Scottish people.ldquoThe union is undeniably in more jeopardy than it has ever been since the end of the th century. The vice the union is caught up in threatens to crush it - on the one hand therersquos the old enemy of Scottish nationalism, on the other therersquos the new enemy of English nationalism.THE FUTURERegardless of Tory mistreatment, the independence case is far from won. Devine says the SNPrsquos ldquoAchilles Heel is its failure to make a convincing economic argument. ldquoThe majority of sensible Scots are waiting to seethe SNP has real economic plans. They need to be totally honest with the electorate. Without the economic case being made itrsquos impossible to say whether ldquothe hammer of blow of Brexit and other aspects of UK government policy would lead to a Yes win.ldquoPeople accept the first few years of a post-union Scotland could be tough, but they may be willing to give the benefit of the doubt and vote for independencetheyrsquore told clearly and honestly what the challenges may be. If the SNP was willing to do that theyrsquod gain respect, Devine says.Devine believes any violence linked to the constitution is currently ldquomost unlikely. The SNP is law-abiding. ldquoScotland isnrsquot Catalonia. However, itrsquos ldquomore dficult to predict what might happen hellip from any extreme [unionist] elementsYes won. Even then it would be ldquosmall scale hellip hooliganism not a real ldquopolitical threat.Given the changed political landscape in England, Devine worries that any future negotiations - over the shape of a second referendum or the terms of separation - ldquowouldnrsquot be benign. London would undoubtedly play hardball. Any negotiations would be pretty brutal.He adds: ldquoIf Yes had won in  negotiations would have been relatively friendly as it was in the interests of both nations. I donrsquot think the English people at the moment are in the mood for that - and the Tory supporting majority certainly arenrsquot."},{"url":null,"title":"senior-snp-mp-admits-losing-second-referendum-mean-chance-independence-gone","story":"With some Nationalists like Alex Salmond pushing for another vote as soon as possible, the veteran backbencher urged caution, noting how his biggest fear was that the pro-independence cause in Scotland would go the same way of that in Quebecdefeated in a second poll it would fizzle out.:Opinion: Throughout the pandemic Boris Johnson has had to battle with himselfldquoThat is the risk, declared Mr Wishart. ldquoFor me, the important thing is winning and you win when you feel you are in the best situation to enter the ring and deliver that knockout blow.

For early residents of Gladstonersquos Land, no means to refrigerate or safely store raw meat and fish, and the backbreaking task of keeping fires going to cook and provide hot water, meant rustling up dinner would be a full time task that was fraught with danger.Lindsay Middleton, PhD researcher in food history at the University of Glasgow and University of Aberdeen, has been working with Gladstonersquos Land owners, the National Trust for Scotland, to create the tour.She says: ldquoHistorical food is something we are becoming increasingly interested in, whether it is history week on the Great British Bake Off or reading recipes in historical cookbooks and marvelling at strange ingredients and cooking techniques.ldquoUnlike French or Italian cuisine, Scottish food is not typically thought of as delicious or particularly ied. But Scottish food does have a rich and ied history.ldquoIn the harsh climate, Scottish people have had to be creative with food, leading to some historical dishes with excellent names, like rumbledethumps, a buttery mixture of potatoes and cabbage inky pinky, leftover roast beef cooked with carrots and gravy hodge podge, a stew of mutton and root vegetables.Meanwhile Scots, it seems have always been a sucker for something sweet: fairy butter, made from egg yolks, sugar and orange flower water, was a popular dessert sauce used to accompany biscuits and cakes.Hedgehog must have tasted better than it sounds: a dessert made with ground almonds, eggs, cream and butter, for some reason it was shaped to look like a hedgehog.The tour examines dishes down the centuries through the eyes of three women who lived at the tenement: Margaret Nobel, the we of a wealthy merchant who ran a high-end grocers and fabric business from the property in the th century, Elizabeth Pillans, an th century draper, and Mary Wilson who ran a boarding house at the location in the early th century.According to Lindsay, servants whose job it was to run Elizabethrsquos th century kitchen had their work cut out.ldquoIn the th century, the way that you would have cooked, illuminated and kept your house warm was by using fire. There is no oven here, only the kitchens of the very wealthy would have had these - having enough wood to keep an oven going was expensive, and ovens themselves took up a lot of space, as well as presenting a heightened fire risk.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until the th century that enclosed stoves and ranges were introduced into kitchens, so all cooking would have been done over an open fire.ldquoYou can imagine the amount of sweat, work and time that went into cooking a meal in the th century, she adds.Edinburghrsquos role as a bustling trade hub meant its better off citizens often had a first taste of exotic and unusual foods imported from across the world, while its narrow Old Town streets would be an aromatic mix of food, bodies and animals ndash alive and dead.ldquoThe smell of food, bodies and animals would have filled the messy and muddy streets, and it would have been incredibly noisy, she adds.ldquoFleshers, or butchers, would have the carcasses of cattle and sheep hanging up as they butchered them, blood joining the mud on the streets. Hucksters, who foraged for and sold shellfish from the nearby coast, would be gutting fish and shelling oysters on the street too.ldquoThere were also more expensive and exotic imported spices, wines and dried fruits.An inventory of Margaretrsquos husbandrsquos possessions in  showed a list of foods that would have been beyond the imagination of the cityrsquos poor, including raisins, ginger, sugar, pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, rice, almonds, cloves, lemon-peel marmalade and tobacco were all listed.By the th century, Edinburgh was fascinated by tea, which would have been offered to customers of Elizabeth Pillansrsquo shop as they browsed her stock of satin, silks, lace, ribbons, furs and muslins.Some tea, however, left a bad taste: green tea would be coloured with dangerous chemicals such as copper carbonate or lead chromate to keep their colour, while black tea was laced with leaves, ash, floor sweepings, lead or sheep dung.Few who indulged in tea at the time, however, are likely to have paused to consider the tea and sugar came at the cost of enslaved lives.Visitors joining the tour will have the opportunity to sample some of Gladstonersquos Land favourites, such as donkey tea, a grim-sounding drink made from toast steeped in hot water until it took the colour and flavour of the bread. Sieved to remove the crumbs, it was then drunk.Rescued from demolition by the Trust in , over the last  years the building has mainly told the story of merchant Thomas lsquoGledstanesrsquo, who bought it in the early th century, and commissioned its Renaissance-style painted ceilings.Years of meticulous historical research has now uncovered the lives of other residents of the property.It has now reopened after a pound. million restoration, with three floors laid out to reflect the lives and employment of its occupants and the rise and decline of the cityrsquos Old Town told through interactive exhibits, documents and furnishings.Tables Through Time: Food in Gladstonersquos Land will begin next month."},{"url":null,"title":"ron-mckays-diary-forget-running-key-health-nice-hot-bath","story":"The research was by Charles James Steward at Coventry University.

As well as spectacular clf and coast views, the path will take in Iron Age forts, the historic Corsewall Lighthouse on the northern coast of the Rhins of Galloway, views of Ailsa Craig and Arran, and the atmospheric Dunskey Castle at Portpatrick.Eventually itrsquos hoped the new Rhins of Galloway Coast Path will also link to a wider network of long-distance routes, including the Southern Upland Way and the Ayrshire Coastal Path.The Rhins of Galloway walking routes takes in locations where several species of wildflowers which reach the northern limits of their UK distribution can be found. In some cases, they are unlikely to be seen where in Scotland.However, the impact of climate change has raised questions over how well they and other small but hardy species of coastal flowers and plants will cope in the future.According to Richard Baines, Curator at Logan Botanic Garden, there is a chance that some coastal species may find themselves trapped. ldquoThe plants are moving in a more northerly direction because of climate change, he says. ldquoBut for plants on this south west coast there is the question of where do they go ldquoIn terms of bioersity, they are an intrinsic part of the food chain for surrounding insects and animals. Their root systems also help stabilize their home soil which helps prevent erosion - a particularly useful factor for the wildflowers at a coastal location such as The Rhins of Galloway Coast.Spotlighting  of the most common species, the wildflower guide which accompanies the exhibition shows visitors how to identy flowers like sea campion, with its sprawling grey leaves and delicate white flowers with a veined bladder which grows on clftops, rocky shores and shingle banks, and English stonecrop.Despite its name, the plant, with its white starry flowers on a matt of succulent leaves, is a common feature on the west coast of Scotland.Some wildflowers, such as golden samphire, which is identiable by its bright yellow daisy-like flower and fleshy stem, reach their northernmost range on the Rhins. The flowers can be found on clfs near the Mull of Galloway.While the likes of wild thyme will be more familiar to many, particularly as they stroll over coastal paths carpeted with its purple flowers and distinct aroma.Itrsquos hoped the exhibition and guide will spark fresh interest in coastal wildflowers and plants which once formed a key part of le in the area.ldquoThere is a whole range of coastal wildflowers that thrive along the Solway Coast, adds Richard. ldquoOver the years, people who lived in the area would have been familiar with the plants for medicines and culinary uses.ldquoThere are also lots of stories in the area related to witchcraft and the use of plants as cures for ailments.One commonly consumed around the coast was sea kale, with its fleshy root which contains more starch than potatoes.While Sea Pink, also called Sea thrt and identiable by its long stems and globes of bright pink flowers, was so commonly known across the country that it featured on the back of old threepenny coins.Some plants are tucked on precarious clfs, making them dangerous to even try to examine up close. However, others provide dazzling carpets of colour ndash sea squill produces vivid blue springtime flowers that blanket the clftops.The exhibition at Logan Botanic Garden, which has been developed alongside the Rhins of Galloway Coast Path Project, includes a photographic display highlighting some of the main species to be found on the route of the path.There are also plans for a programme of events which will offer visitors to the opportunities to find out more about the rich natural and cultural heritage of the Rhins of Galloway.The creation of the path, which is managed by Dumfries and Galloway Council, has been financially supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Coastal Communities Fund.lsquoWildflowers of Coastal Clfsrsquo runs at Logan Botanic Garden in Port Logan, throughout June."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-dominic-cummings-testimony-shows-tory-dregs-risen-top","story":"One of the most iniquitous aspects of Team UKrsquos increasingly desperate attempts to mitigate its early failures in responding to the health crisis was to roam the planet looking for pictures to show how thankful we should be.ldquoLook, we know a lot of you will emerge from the pandemic minus a granny or two but at least they werenrsquot lying in the streets begging for oxygen or getting taken to filthy wards on the backs of bicycles.The BBC, self-appointed captain of Team GB, has ceased to be a news-gathering operation during the last  months and become an emotional crutch.Announcements of mass job losses were accepted unquestioningly and footage of irresponsible northerners gathering on public transport and thronging beaches came with an unmistakeable patina of disdain. UK ministers queued to be interviewed on BBC Breakfast where a cuddle and a hot cup of tea awaited while the other side was boycotted for its disrespectful line of questioning.We were invited to recoil at how quickly the infrastructures of less civilised nations were crumbling.And yet, as Mr Cummings revealed in eye-watering detail on Wednesday, the UK Governmentrsquos critical response unit resembled feeding time at the zoo. Three months after initial reports of a lethal pandemic on the loose our Prime Minister was so dismissive of the threat he wanted to get publicly infected by it.Herd immunity, as Mr Cummings revealed, really was the chosen policy in those crucial early weeks, despite the fact that public health experts were all warning that pursuing this without a vaccine had never been used to deal with infectious diseases.The UK Government still insists it was only following the science. Perhaps they were, but they seem to have been using the Eric Morecambe approach: playing all the right notes but not necessarily in the right order.Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at Edinburgh University, dismantled this approach yesterday. ldquoThe reliance on complex theoretical modelling over the principles of basic infectious disease prevention was a problem so was groupthink within Sage [Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies]As Mr Cummings continued to take his flame-thrower to the administration hersquod helped into power you could predict the means by which his targets would defend themselves.

In the last five years this ldquooddball had orchestrated an unlikely Brexit triumph before securing a comfortable electoral majority for its chief proponents. His attention to detail and knack for reading the runes in places that had never previously registered on the Toriesrsquo collective SatNav have made this party virtually unassailable in England. Yet, within a year the people who benefited from his intellect and instincts are insisting hersquos an unreliable witness. Aye, right.Some of the Prime Ministerrsquos defenders compared his coronavirus ordeal to the challenge faced by Winston Churchill at the start of the Second World War. ldquoLook, the PMrsquos done well in the circumstances. This though, doesnrsquot bear much scrutiny either. Arguably, Britain, facing conquest, slaughter, and enslavement from the greatest military force since the Romans started the war from a much weaker position than the modern, affluent, technologically advanced state that had been given due warning about this pandemic.Of course, some things remain unchanged since . Britain is still run by a tiny, upper-class, elite drawn almost exclusively from a handful of select finishing schools and Oxfordrsquos aristocratic drinking-clubs. The problem in , though, is that in those sepia-remembered days  years ago at least it was an elite that included some quality.These people ndash the Hancocks the Williamsons the Rees-Moggs ndash are the dreck: only there because of their slavish devotion to Brexit. They have built a sordid little mafia industry on the side, ever eager to exploit the pandemic for their own personal enrichment.As Matt Hancock got into his ministerial car on Thursday morning, he was wearing a Union Jack face-mask, this being the establishmentrsquos chosen mot of defiance throughout the pandemic.

This trust comes with a caveat though. For, when Holyrood seeks to plot Scotlandrsquos Covid recovery, at its heart there must be a preferential option for Glasgow. The metropolitan city-region of Glasgow accounts for almost a third of Scotlandrsquos population and these communities will be hit hardest by the job losses and leline service cuts to come.The physical and mental scarring theyrsquoll experience will deserve special attention.

The former BiFab fabrication yard at Burntisland in Fe was not part of the deal and has since sprung back to le under Forth Ports ownership, with Aberdeen-based e systems specialist Orca Oceanic Systems setting up an operations facility.Unite Scottish Secretary, Pat Rafferty who has been fighting for a fairer deal over green jobs said:\"Itrsquos absolutely staggering that based on how the offshore wind sector is supposed to be the jewel in Scotlands renewables revolution that only  jobs were estimated to have been directly created in .\"When you factor into that the dismal picture that the Scottish Government projected , jobs to have been created by now, and that only  more jobs have been created since  then you begin to appreciate the abject failure of government policy at the Scottish and UK level.\"CS Wind in Machrihanish, which manufactures onshore and offshore wind turbines has been mothballed by its Korean owners.\"And we also have had the well documented challenges facing the BiFab yards in Fe and Arnish.Ministers championed the desire for the nation to cash in on low carbon in  and  - saying Scotland can be the \"green energy capital of Europe\" with a workforce rising to , and offshore wind alone bringing in an estimated poundbn in inward investment.Office for National Statistics figures produced from a low carbon and renewable energy economy survey show that in Scotland there were just , jobs in the low carbon and renewable energy economy - including businesses specialising in offshore and onshore wind, hydropower, carbon capture, alternative fuels, energy efficient lighting, low emission vehicles.Twelve years ago, the potential wind and marine energy power in the Pentland Firth - where the north-east Atlantic meets the North Sea ndash led the then Scotlands First Minister Alex Salmond to dub it the \"Saudi Arabia of Renewables\" with BiFab at the time making turbines for offshore wind farms.In November, , First Minister Alex Salmond, first announced a poundm investment fund to finance the offshore wind sector.He said it could create up to , jobs and add pound. billion in value to Scotlands economy over  years.Two months earlier, he told financiers that innovation and advances in clean green energy present a \"pivotal turning point in human history\".Opening the Scottish Low Carbon Investment conference in Edinburgh, he urged private finance leaders to seize the multi-billion pound opportunities arising from the renewable and low carbon technology revolution.He unveiled an industry-led Offshore Wind Route Map, setting out the key actions required in the coming years to fully realise the huge potential around the coast of Scotland - estimated at that time to have a quarter of Europes potential offshore wind and tidal capacity and a tenth of its wave resource.He announced: \"This is more than a once-in-a-generation opportunity such as North Sea Oil and Gas was.\"The Scottish Governments low carbon strategy published in  described the large scale development of offshore wind as representing the \"biggest opportunity for sustainable economic growth in Scotland for a generation\" with Scotland having an estimated % of Europes offshore wind potential.But the Herald on Sunday can reveal that the POWERS fund that was eventually launched in  and overseen by Scottish Enterprise for poundm, only awarded one poundm grant during its six years.Samsung Heavy Industries won the award in October,  towards the poundm capital cost of building their MW prototype turbine at Energy Park Fe.It was billed by Scottish Enterprise as the largest and most powerful offshore wind turbine who said it had the backing of Mr Salmond \"whose government wants all Scotlands electricity to come from renewables by \".The Korean company was said to have invested poundmillion in the Fe wind turbine demonstrator scheme, and Scottish Enterprise said it had the potential to create up to  jobs in Scotland.Alex Salmond said of SHIs move to base its first European offshore wind project in Fe in an inward venture championed as worth up to poundm: \"I am extremely pleased to welcome this inward investment by SHI which further reinforces Scotlands place in the development of the next generation of offshore wind turbines.ldquoTheir choice of Scotland as their first base in Europe for renewable technology development is testament to the fact this country is fast becoming the European centre for research and development in new offshore wind technologies.\"Insik Roh, chief executive of Samsung Heavy Industries, said at the time: \"The testing of the new MW offshore wind turbine at the Fe Energy Park signies a milestone in the development of Samsungs new wind turbine generator system.

The response was extremely positive with all  places allocated in March quickly were booked with requests for more sessions, said Ms Stephen.ldquoI was touched to see how welcoming and supportive the staff were. For a few weeks, I was able to give treatments with a positive feedback, just before the lockdown measures were implemented, bringing all complementary therapy to a halt.The Day Therapies team kept working, trying to find new ways to virtually support patients and their families, organising calls, video coffee mornings and askedshe could help.Ms Stephen is one of hundreds of volunteers whose remarkable efforts in the past few months are being highlighted as Volunteers Week  gets under way next week.She added: ldquoDistant healing or Enkaku treatment appeared as the obvious option to keep giving support in this dficult time. However, explaining how a Reiki treatment helps is one thing and explaining how a distant Reiki treatment works is another. Thankfully, the experience I had gained receiving and giving distant healing on a regular basis over the past two years really helped and gave me the confidence to offer the sessions.\"Read more: Scotlands covid memorial campaign appoints artist to work on historic projectMs Stephen said it was heart-warming to receive feedback and comments of the sensation patients feel during a treatment and the emotional or physical impact it has on them.She added:ldquoKnowing that some patients had more energy for the day, or that their mood had been so uplted was wonderful. Family members telling me that their loved onersquos eyes were lit up and more alive after a treatment and that after a few sessions they started to take a few, more confident steps when it was dficult before was amazing.Alan Stevenson, Volunteer Scotland Chief Executive, said this was very much a time to thank all of the volunteers in the UK, for the support and services they provide each year.He said: ldquoThe pandemic has changed volunteering with many more of us helping others within our local neighbourhood than ever before, so taking the time to thank them for this critical contribution and connection to the most vulnerable in our society is essential.

Just having someone who consistently shows up, without judgment, to listen, have a chat, listen to music, go for a walk or a coffee canrsquot be underestimated.

Key leaders from each congregation in Northern Ireland, including those across County Antrim, were encouraged to participate.David Thompson said that he was pleased that each presbytery has responded positively to the Moderator’s invitation to be part of the programme. “Timing is key in building progress and trying to do so too early may lead to frustration. “Leaving it too late, may mean we miss an important moment. This is why we began with our northern presbyteries this month, with events for congregations in our southern presbyteries taking place in June, which seems about right given their setting and circumstances,” David Thompson said.Running the events has involved a signicant leap of faith and rapid learning by staff in how to harness the potential of digital technology and presentation. Lynne Herbison’ PCI’s Programme Development Officer added, “The team involved have learned a lot and those new skills will be invaluable in opening up a world of possibility in how we can now engage with congregations and their members in the future. “Nothing compares to being physically together, but we hope our digital  will be able to supplement that and improve the reach of what we can offer to our churches and their members.”Presbyterian Moderator, Right Reverend Dr David Bruce, who took part in the events, said, “This has been a massive undertaking, delivered in a very short window so as not to miss this crucial moment as we continue to turn this long awaited corner.“ I really want to commend everyone who has made this important series possible.“We have been through exceptionally challenging times and I don’t want to minimise that and the suffering that this pandemic has caused. In my contributions to each event, looking at how congregations can begin to move forward, I tried to convey a sense that change often forces reinvention and reconsideration, opening up new pathways and patterns that overlay the old familiar foundations of church le that we cherish. “Exploring this, I am looking forward to welcoming our Republic of Ireland presbyteries to ‘Fanning the Flame’ in June.” he said.Dr Bruce concluded by saying, “In the long history of God’s people there have been many times like the months we have experienced, and in those dark days God was at work, and He is today. “It is my earnest prayer that we will see tangible signs of His leading, so that we can press on with confidence into this new beginning.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1622208073289.jpg--covid_19___fri_28th_may_figures.jpg?1622208073000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210528newscovid 19 fri 28th may figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows No further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Destinations include Portugal, Israel, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand.However, today’s poll reveals many are still deeply reluctant to hop on a plane abroad any time soon.People were asked, once vaccinated, when they would consider a foreign holiday.Just % said they plan to head away in  — % may travel this summer while another % would consider an overseas trip later in the year.The vast majority , said it would be next year before they think about going abroad.Another % said it would be two or three years before a trip outside the UK or Ireland, while % have no plans to go overseas at any point.The remaining % were unsure or had no firm opinion.Fewer older people are willing to consider overseas travel this year. Just % would consider doing so — % this summer and % at any point this year. More than halfsaid it would be next year before they consider jetting off, while % would leave it two or three years.By contrast, almost halfof  to  year olds are considering heading overseas this year — with % hoping to get away in the next few months and % later in the year. Another % will leave it to . Broken down by gender, males of any age are more willing to take a trip abroad — % plan to do so this summer and a further % will at some point in . Another % said it would be next year.However, just over a quarter of females plan to holiday abroad in  — % this summer and % this year. Some % plan to leave trips to .It comes as a public health expert from Belfast warned against summer holidays — despite the traffic light system for foreign travel.Professor Gabriel Scally told holidaymakers to “beware” and also warned it is “irresponsible” to travel to other countries while potentially infected with a dangerous iant.Prof Scally, a member of independent Sage, said: “The regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe issued a statement in the last couple of days saying there shouldn’t be international travel and I would agree with that.“It is undesirable to have people holidaying in international resorts at this time for all sorts of reasons.“It isn’t necessarily safe to travel on airplanes, there was a flight between India and Hong Kong and there were  infections and they were only picked up because of quarantine in Hong Kong.“Flights are dficult, but it isn’t just the flights, it’s what happens at arrivals and departures with queues of people in restricted spaces.“You also have lots of people from dferent countries mixing together at foreign resorts.“If you think back a year, the virus came to the UK and Republic of Ireland by people ing from holidays.”He continued: “It’s important to remember that the vaccine isn’t the cure all.“There’s always the risk posed by iants and it’s irresponsible to go off to another country and potentially take a dangerous iant with you.”Prof Scally also criticised the traffic light system, saying: “We need a proper managed quarantine system for everyone arriving into the country.”The Department of Health and the Executive were contacted for comment.Yesterday an airline industry chief said people who have received both doses of the Covid- vaccine should not face restrictions when travelling to countries on the Government’s amber list.Willie Walsh, director-general of airline body Iata, said people should be allowed to make up their own minds about the risks of travelling to amber list destinationsthey have received their jabs.Those ing from countries on the Government’s amber list must quarantine at home for  days and take pre-departure and post-arrival tests.But Mr Walsh, who is the former chief executive of IAG — the parent company of British Airways — said amber restrictions should be the same as those for green list countries for fully vaccinated passengers.He told the Mail on Sunday: “People were promised the benefit of being vaccinated — a vaccine idend — and they should be given it.“I thinkyou’ve had both shots then there’s no argument you can make to say those restrictions can remain in place, and people should be free to decide for themselvesthey see any risk in travelling to a green or amber country,” the former IAG chief executive added.Most ReadPolice probing UDA threats claim as split in DUP deepensMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it allPSNI armed response team attend RVH hospital after ‘incident’ in south BelfastCottage le offers chance to own some local history‘No-shows’ add to restaurant owner’s woeTop VideosPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayJoanna Lumley sends message to Islandmagee soldier before his deathLatest CoronavirusGreen light for cross-border breaks as Republic reopensMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths, fewer than  cases and vaccine programme extendedLatestBank holiday likely to see hottest day of the year so farThere is a ‘deal to be had’ on global tech tax reform, Sunak saysSF minister declines to comment on deputy FM nomination refusal queryWestminster Cathedral congregation welcome Prime Minister’s marriage newsJordan Banjo reveals he had hoped to dance with Diversity in Masked Dancer final,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PAAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than half of people in Northern Ireland believe parents should have the right to refuse a Covid vaccine for their children, our poll shows.The news comes after Northern Ireland’s vaccine roll-out opened to those aged  to  and a raft of Covid restrictions are lted from Monday.“This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice,” Health Minister Robin Swann said.According to the Belfast -LucidTalk poll, % of respondents felt parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should not and % said they did not know, were not sure or had no opinion.The figures, however, y depending on the age and religious make-up of those who took part in the poll.Regarding  to  year-olds, a majorityfelt parents should not be able to turn down a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should and % didn’t know or had no opinion.Those aged  to , on the other hand, had starkly contrasting views. Some % said parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children and % said they should not. And % said they didn’t know, were unsure or had no opinion.Vaccines may be refused for a iety of reasons. For instance, earlier this year several countries temporarily halted the roll-out of the AstraZeneca jab due to concerns of rare blood clots.Due to evidence suggesting that younger people may be at greater risk of the extremely rare clots associated with the AstaZeneca vaccine, those in this age group can choose which vaccine to receive.The latest advice states that anyone under  can book a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or they can make what the Department of Health has described as an “informed decision” and get the AstraZeneca jab at Belfast’s SSE Arena or at participating community pharmacies.More than one million people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine to date.Looking at the religious make-up of those who took part in the poll, it is apparent that Protestants are more likely to feel parents should have a say over vaccinating their children than when compared to Catholics.Some % of Protestant respondents felt this way, while % felt they should not have the right to turn down a jab for their children and % had no opinion, were not sure or didn’t know.Of those designating as Catholic, % felt they should have the right to turn down a vaccine for their children and % did not. The remaining % said they didn’t know or were unsure.In terms of those of no religion, % were in favour of parents having this right and % did not. Some % weren’t sure or had no opinion on the matter.On Sunday the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride urged everyone to get vaccinated. He said: “A Public Health England study has found the vaccines are highly effective. This underlines the need for people to come forward for their first and second doses as soon as they are available.”Most ReadPolice probing UDA threats claim as split in DUP deepensMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it allPSNI armed response team attend RVH hospital after ‘incident’ in south BelfastCottage le offers chance to own some local history‘No-shows’ add to restaurant owner’s woeTop VideosPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayJoanna Lumley sends message to Islandmagee soldier before his deathLatest CoronavirusGreen light for cross-border breaks as Republic reopensMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths, fewer than  cases and vaccine programme extendedLatestBank holiday likely to see hottest day of the year so farThere is a ‘deal to be had’ on global tech tax reform, Sunak saysSF minister declines to comment on deputy FM nomination refusal queryWestminster Cathedral congregation welcome Prime Minister’s marriage newsJordan Banjo reveals he had hoped to dance with Diversity in Masked Dancer final,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They are doing demonstrable harm to every inidual in Northern Ireland and it is having a devastating impact.”The protocol is a post-Brexit arrangement designed to keep the Irish border open by ensuring Northern Ireland continues to follow the EU’s trading rules.Mr Poots has vowed to overthrow it, over fears it damages the integrity of the UK internal market and Northern Ireland’s place in it.In March, The UK Government unilaterally extended some grace periods associated with the NI Protocol in a bid to avoid a clf-edge plunge into extra paperwork.“We have a grace period currently, when those grace periods end we are going to have , checks per week of goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland,” added Edwin Poots.“There are more checks in the port of Belfast and Larne than there is in Rotterdam, Europe#s biggest port. We have more checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland than there is between Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova.“Are they more trustworthy trading partners than Great Britain  Of course that isn’t the case.”When asked by Andrew Marrviolence in the run up to the Summer marching season was a possibility, the new DUP leader said he didn’t want to use the “threat of violence” to get changes to the protocol.“Our arguments are very clear they are very coherent. This is the European union seeking to punish the United Kingdom, as a consequence Northern Ireland is being used as a plaything for the European Union,” added Mr Poots.“I can assure you Northern Ireland should be nobody’s plaything.”...I\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fbc .ece AUTOCROP w Vice-President%of%the%European%Commission%in%charge%of%Inter-institutional%relations%and%Foresight%Maros%Sefcovic%attends%the%third%meeting%of%the%EU-UK%Joint%Committee%at%EU%headquarters%in%Brussels%Monday%Sept.%%.%Vice-President%of%the%European%Commission%in%charge%of%Inter-institutional%relations%and%Foresight%Maros%Sefcovic%met%Monday%with%the%Chancellor%of%the%Duchy%of%Lancaster%Michael%Gove%with%EU%chief%Brexit%negotiator%Michel%Barnier%joining%by%videoconference.%John%Thys%Pool%via%AP...I w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fbc .ece AUTOCROP w Vice-President%of%the%European%Commission%in%charge%of%Inter-institutional%relations%and%Foresight%Maros%Sefcovic%attends%the%third%meeting%of%the%EU-UK%Joint%Committee%at%EU%headquarters%in%Brussels%Monday%Sept.%%.%Vice-President%of%the%European%Commission%in%charge%of%Inter-institutional%relations%and%Foresight%Maros%Sefcovic%met%Monday%with%the%Chancellor%of%the%Duchy%of%Lancaster%Michael%Gove%with%EU%chief%Brexit%negotiator%Michel%Barnier%joining%by%videoconference.%John%Thys%Pool%via%AP...I w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  ...I\"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose...I\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fbc .ece AUTOCROP w Vice-President%of%the%European%Commission%in%charge%of%Inter-institutional%relations%and%Foresight%Maros%Sefcovic%attends%the%third%meeting%of%the%EU-UK%Joint%Committee%at%EU%headquarters%in%Brussels%Monday%Sept.%%.%Vice-President%of%the%European%Commission%in%charge%of%Inter-institutional%relations%and%Foresight%Maros%Sefcovic%met%Monday%with%the%Chancellor%of%the%Duchy%of%Lancaster%Michael%Gove%with%EU%chief%Brexit%negotiator%Michel%Barnier%joining%by%videoconference.%John%Thys%Pool%via%AP...I w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fbc .ece AUTOCROP w Vice-President%of%the%European%Commission%in%charge%of%Inter-institutional%relations%and%Foresight%Maros%Sefcovic%attends%the%third%meeting%of%the%EU-UK%Joint%Committee%at%EU%headquarters%in%Brussels%Monday%Sept.%%.%Vice-President%of%the%European%Commission%in%charge%of%Inter-institutional%relations%and%Foresight%Maros%Sefcovic%met%Monday%with%the%Chancellor%of%the%Duchy%of%Lancaster%Michael%Gove%with%EU%chief%Brexit%negotiator%Michel%Barnier%joining%by%videoconference.%John%Thys%Pool%via%AP...I w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  ...I\"Vice-President of the European Commission in charge of Inter-institutional relations and Foresight Maros Sefcovic attends the third meeting of the EU-UK Joint Committee at EU headquarters in Brussels, Monday, Sept. , .

There will still be some sun to enjoy, but it is likely to be between increasing cloud, according to the Met Office.Wednesday will be slightly cooler with highs of  C, with the daytime becoming increasingly cloudy. It will be a largely dry day though, with only a small chance of isolated showers.Towards the end of the week, temperatures will drop away slightly and there is a greater chance of some more unsettled conditions and cloud.

That is because, not of an election, but because of what took place before the election,” he said.A party ided, a police probe and several resignations within the next week are not the only issues Poots must deal with.His choice of first minister and how he responds to outstanding issues such as the implementation of Irish language legislation and the Northern Ireland protocol will be watched closely by Sinn Féin, his partners in government.Read MoreGail Walker:OpinionWhy Poots’ and Paisley’s Back to the Future strategy casts a shadow over not just the DUP but the Union“It’s important to remember the majority of parties and ministers in the Executive do not support his position,” a Sinn Féin source said.The source said the party has not ruled out refusing to nominate a deputy first minister after Poots’ proposes Ms Foster’s replacement, who is believed to be former communities minister Paul Givan.He is partly blamed for the collapse of the devolved institutions four years ago, when he and his officials cut funding for an Irish language initiative and forced an early election.“I am hearing September mooted for a potential election,” said another source.In Dublin, Mr Poots’ first few weeks will be watched closely by Taoiseach Micheál Martin, who is expected to speak to the DUP leader about the contentious issue of the protocol.Speaking after his election as leader, Mr Poots claimed relationships between Belfast and Dublin “are really, really bad”.Meanwhile, the British-Irish Council will take place in Co Fermanagh next month, where Mr Martin, along with the UK government’s Michael Gove and Scotland’s Nicola Sturgeon, will meet with leaders from Wales, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Northern Ireland.However, who will be leading Stormont remains to be seen as Ms Foster, who is still first minister, has threatened to quit this Tuesday — weeks earlier than planned —Mr Poots names her successor..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadPolice probing UDA threats claim as split in DUP deepensMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it allPSNI armed response team attend RVH hospital after ‘incident’ in south BelfastCottage le offers chance to own some local history‘No-shows’ add to restaurant owner’s woeTop VideosPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayJoanna Lumley sends message to Islandmagee soldier before his deathLatest PoliticsSearch for common ground for the good of NI: Arlene’s words of wisdom to successorPolice probing UDA threats claim as split in DUP deepensJon TongeOpinionThere’s no disloyalty in UUP ranks, but Beattie badly needs some new recruitsTributes as UUP veteran Olive Whitten dies following illnessDepartment of Health cannot sanction Professor Ian Young despite public inquiry criticism LatestBank holiday likely to see hottest day of the year so farThere is a ‘deal to be had’ on global tech tax reform, Sunak saysSF minister declines to comment on deputy FM nomination refusal queryWestminster Cathedral congregation welcome Prime Minister’s marriage newsJordan Banjo reveals he had hoped to dance with Diversity in Masked Dancer final,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueArlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill at the Strand Arts Centre.May   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFrom the DUP in turmoil to MLAs needing Yoda#s wisdom, Andrew Madden and Gareth Cross take a closer look at some of the more unusual things in the Assembly and further afield this week.Monday: Outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster forgot her worries on Monday, with a trip to the cinema in east Belfast with deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill.The pair were snapped with large boxes of popcorn as they joined pensioners at the Strand Arts Centre, as coronavirus restrictions lted, for a showing of classic short films.During the visit Mrs Foster questioned the existence of a letter of no-confidence against her signed by DUP MLAs and MPs that led to her downfall. It#s now been nearly four weeks since I heard about it and I still haven#t seen it, she said.In the Assembly, Justice Minister Naomi Long told MLAs she saw no substantive reason for a judge-led review into the Bobby Storey funeral. Ms O#Neill said it was time to get on with rebuilding our economy rather than continuing to focus on the funeral of the former IRA member.New UUP leader Doug Beattie said issues around the funeral could affect the future of Stormont itselfnot addressed, warning of terminal decline”.A busy week for Edwin Poots began with him answering a question from Jim Allister about compensation for slaughtered animals. Mr Poots, in his written answer, revealed that in   his department paid £,, in compensation for animals slaughtered for disease control purposes. Of this, £,, related to bovine Tuberculosis £, related to avian influenza and £, for Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis.Tuesday: The Assembly debated Finance Minister Conor Murphy#s budget with MLAs highly critical.Finance Committee chair Steve Aiken said it was hard to scrutinise the budget given its limited granularity, occasional evasions and obfuscations from departments.SDLP MLA Matthew O#Toole criticised NHS waiting lists, saying we should be ashamed and the budget contained no plans to address his concerns.The DUP#s Paul Frew responded, saying it was refreshing to hear Luke Skywalker in the corner, although he did sound more like Chewbacca at times, he looks to a truth that we all need the wisdom of Yoda in times of stress like this”.Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon was also critical of new DUP leader#s Edwin Poots# refusal to attend meetings of north-south bodies saying it was hugely frustrating the meetings had been deliberately obstructed.TUV leader Jim Allister said he hoped Mr Poots would refuse to engage until the Northern Ireland Protocol was dismantled, saying it had trashed east-west relations. Later the new DUP leader said he remained committed to all his obligations, but north-south relations had never been worse.Arlene Foster continued to throw herself into events to forget her troubles during her final days as First Minister.During a visit to Brooklands Primary School in Dundonald she said: “Regardless of what’s happening where, a visit to a school never fails to lt my spirits. Meeting young people is always a humbling, but invigorating experience.Wednesday: Unionists were sacriced for the Northern Ireland Protocol, Westminster#s NI Affairs Committee heard.PUP Belfast councillor Dr John Kyle said nationalists and unionists had not been treated equally during the Brexit process.The identity and ethos of the unionist community, as equal citizens with everyone  in the United Kingdom, was sacriced, he said.Dr Kyle did accept the protocol may have some economic benefits, but added for many unionists being British is more important than being prosperous.In the Assembly the Education Committee heard evidence from the General Teaching Council for Northern Ireland .Chair Brendan Morgan revealed that in nine months’ time organisations in Northern Ireland would no longer have access to the EU safeguarding database which is used to for background checks on applicants as a result of Brexit.“Is Brexit is actually exposing our children to potential risk , Sinn Fein#s Pat Sheehan asked.“As of September , we will no longer have access to that database which screens professional teachers,” Mr Morgan explained.Thursday: What was supposed to be a formal ratication process for his leadership of the DUP turned into a nightmare for Edwin Poots.As new UUP leader Doug Beattie contentedly sipped a whiskey after being unanimously elected to lead his party, a DUP rubber stamping exercise laid the party#s isions bare for the world to see.While an attempt to hold a secret ballot to confirm Mr Poots# leadership was rejected, senior party figures including Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Gavin Robinson, Gregory Campbell and Diane Dodds walked out while he was making his acceptance speech.Outgoing leader Arlene Foster also left early, and as a waiting media asked her for information on what was happening inside, a cheerful Mrs Foster quipped you#ll soon find out and flashed a peace sign.Paul Bell, a member of the Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP for over  years, emotionally quit and said the party would haemorrhage votes as a result of Mrs Foster#s treatment.The issue of nurses’ pay was back of the agenda. Alex Easton asked Health Minister Robin Swann, in an Assembly question, about plans for a pay rise in the coming year.Mr Swann responded: “The pay round for   for NHS and HSC staff has not yet been finalised. Any decision on a pay award for nurses and other NI health workers, will be taken after the pay review bodies make their recommendations..Mr Swann said he was “committed to a fair pay settlement for all our healthcare staff going forward”Friday: The fallout from the DUP#s leadership fiasco continued into Friday. After reports that Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told Thursday#s meeting that his campaign team had been subjected to threats and intimidation from the UDA, there were calls for a police investigation.Sinn Fein#s North Belfast MP John Finucane called the claims deeply disturbing.If true, this is a very worrying development that an armed, illegal organisation was involved in influencing the outcome of the leadership contest of the largest party in unionism and a party of government, he said.It represents an attempt to subvert the democratic process and that is totally unacceptable.Arlene Foster announced she would stand down from the role on Tuesdayher replacement Edwin Poots proceeds with an Executive reshuffle.She also had some advice for her successor: There are very many good people who vote for us, who support us but he needs to recognise there is a lot of work to do in terms of healing isions that are quite obviously there in the party..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadPolice probing UDA threats claim as split in DUP deepensMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it allPSNI armed response team attend RVH hospital after ‘incident’ in south BelfastCottage le offers chance to own some local history‘No-shows’ add to restaurant owner’s woeTop VideosPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayJoanna Lumley sends message to Islandmagee soldier before his deathLatest PoliticsSearch for common ground for the good of NI: Arlene’s words of wisdom to successorPolice probing UDA threats claim as split in DUP deepensJon TongeOpinionThere’s no disloyalty in UUP ranks, but Beattie badly needs some new recruitsTributes as UUP veteran Olive Whitten dies following illnessDepartment of Health cannot sanction Professor Ian Young despite public inquiry criticism LatestBank holiday likely to see hottest day of the year so farThere is a ‘deal to be had’ on global tech tax reform, Sunak saysSF minister declines to comment on deputy FM nomination refusal queryWestminster Cathedral congregation welcome Prime Minister’s marriage newsJordan Banjo reveals he had hoped to dance with Diversity in Masked Dancer final,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Devine is the current Motorsport Ireland International Driver of the Year and is looking forward to ato the ERC series where he has produced a number of eye catching drives since he took a debut podium on Rally Hungary in . “I can’t wait to get my ERC season up and running,” Devine commented. We’ve got some testing under our belt in the new car and it feels really good, but there’s nothing better than actual competition to see where you’re at. googletag.cmd.push Rally Poland will be a new event to me as it didn’t run last year so we are going to do Rally Žemaitija in Lithuania as a warm up beforehand to get up to speed. Last year’s ERC campaign didn’t get off to a good start but we finished well and I’m hoping to take that momentum into . It takes a lot of backing to mount a challenge at this level and I’m delighted to welcome some new partners on board this season including Parts For Cars, Lyons of Limerick, Rentokil Initial, Trailerstuff.ie and Fire Protection Ireland. Without them and existing backers like Curran Gate, Pirelli, TST Transport, EARS Motorsport, Marina Racewear and the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy, this season just wouldn’t be possible.” googletag.cmd.push The move to a Ford will see Callumto a brand he’s rallied with before and M-Sport will be keeping a watchful eye on Callum’s progress this season.“The European Rally Championship has long been a proving ground for young talent looking to make their mark on the world stage, and it’s great to see another young driver choosing to take this route with the Fiesta. saidM-Sport Managing Director, Malcolm Wilson OBE. We’ve been aware of Callum for a number of years now following strong performances with the Fiesta R in Junior WRC and Fiesta R in Ireland. He’s got talent, and I’m keen to see what he can do as he tackles some ofEurope’s most famous events with the Fiesta Rally.”     M-Sport Ford Team Principal, Richard Millener added: “It’s great to see Callum back behind the wheel of the Fiesta and I’m looking forward to seeing what he can do this year. He had a great season with the Fiesta in , finishing third overall in the Irish Tarmac Championship and securing his first victory in Donegal – and we’re all keen to see him carry those performances onto the European stage. He’s already completed one year at this level, and now that he’s reunited with the Fiesta we want to help him take that next step. He’s got the initial experience under his belt, and we will give him as much support as we can to allow him to excel. The competition will be strong, but Callum is a very determined and talented young driver with the potential to surprise a few people this year.” Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy driver Devine will be joined for his ERC adventure by co-driver James Fulton and the Championship will consist of eight rounds taking place in Poland, Latvia, Italy, the Czech Republic, the Azores, Portugal, Hungary and Gran Canarias.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After crossing the bridge, I head up the hill and pull the car in opposite the Vivo and the magnicently named Rio Grande bar. Parks Rio Grande, the Faughan River, flows through the centre of the village, which this afternoon sits under an angry-looking sky. A woman walks her dog down Learmount Road, her face set against the stf breeze that is swishing through the trees surrounding the village. The scene on Learmount Road leading up the hill. Rain starts to fall as a mother guides her toddler out the doors of the Vivo, one hand clutching hers and the other gripping the bottle of juice he has just been bought. googletag.cmd.push A large plastic ice cream cone sits hopefully outside the shop. Up the hill comes a learner driver seemingly on a lesson. She stops outside Learmount Resource Centre and disappears into the building, before emerging with her child in tow to resume her lesson. A delivery driver pulls into the yard of Devine Kitchens. He s to his cab and pulls out a hammer. Things must be getting serious. As I cross the bridge, I spot the wheel from an old watermill by the river side, almost reclaimed by its surroundings. A remnant of an  flax mill known as Quigleys Mill. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most clear view of the mill is from the top of the hill outside Park Hardware and DIY. Greg McElhinney and Matthew Devine. Inside, owner Greg McElhinney says the last year has been busy. “With construction and everything  closing down last April, we were very busy, which was good for us because people from the local area were able to do home projects,” he tells me. “The weather was good as well, so youd a lot of painting and decorating – fences and gardens and stuff like that – going on. “People were happy there was a local business still operating, because a lot of the bigger hardware stores had closed.     “It got to the stage when it was hard to source materials because suppliers were closed until June time, but people were happy enough to occupy their time. They had nothing  to do.” The remains of Quigleys Mill, Park. Parks postal area recorded an increase in Covid cases last week, and despite the attachment to Derry city skewing the numbers, Greg admits there is still a degree of worry locally. “The majority of the population feel we still have to be serious about this. Its drilled into everybody at this stage, like putting your seatbelt on in the car,” he says. “The worry now is were straddling the Donegal border to a certain extent and case numbers are very high either side of it. “There is more positivity now than there was maybe six weeks ago though. Society is opening up again, and the vaccinations are a positive thing.” Covid has taken its toll on rural le too, and compliance with regulations has come at a social cost for village communities. “Where were based is very much a rural area, with a lot of the farming community and tradesmen and stuff,” says Greg. “You get some people who, by chance, meet up outside the shop here and have an opportunity to have a chat that maybe havent seen each other in a few months. “Those guys would have been at markets or farm meets every week, or pubs, but now you see them sitting out there for half an hour chatting to each other. “The social aspect, face to face, is the biggest thing. “The local community group have done a lot of work with the walkways there over the past number of years, which is very good.” Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty from Learmount Community Development Group. The local community group to which Greg refers is Learmount Community Development Group, which is nestled down a lane next to the entrance to Learmount Forest. Over the last year, Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty have noticed a big increase in people using Parks hidden gem. “We would have come down here some mornings and that car park would be full,” says Caroline. “Our secret Learmount Forest isnt a secret any more, and thats great, because everybody wants out, and weve had drop-ins coming from that.” “The forest has been fantastic for people being able to get out and safely meet their neighbours,” adds Catriona. “Theyll maybe call in at quiet times to have a socially distanced cup of tea. That social aspect has been missed, they are missing company and casual conversation.” Caroline feels the experience of the last year has sharpened focus on the issue of loneliness that had been hiding in plain sight. “We had a man who lives alone and had been sick for two or three days,” she says. “He hadnt been out and had no food in the house, so thankfully we were able to help with that. “You just know people are lonely and looking to get out again, but at the same time are a bit anxious about it. “Theyre happy to take the summer out of it and see what happens. There is certainly a lot of loneliness, isolation and depression though. “You could obviously be in the middle of a housing site and still be lonely, but when you see some of the people on their own, up a lane, they see nobody. They barely even see the postman now.” Working with both young and old people, the group have seen the effect the pandemic and its associated lockdowns have had on both generations.  “A lot of our work is with older people, and whilst theyre saying theyre fed up, some of them are getting a wee bit set in their ways,” says Caroline. “You just know by talking to them. We had a woman who always came in every week, even when it was bad, and she hasnt been in about two months. “Its highlighted how much we miss the social side of things, not being able to get out and meet friends. Even for the youth. “People always think all they need is their phone, because thats all theyre sitting on, but you can see now how the youth are crying out as much for social contact as any other generation.” There is hope though, that with the vaccines roll out and the upcoming warmer weather, that the group will be able to run some of their usual summer events. “We are looking at putting together a summer programme, but wed be a bit nervous ourselves about bringing a group of people into the room,” says Caroline.  “It would be perfectthere was good weather, because it will be planned outdoors. If the weather is bad, well take it over to Park hall, because its a bit bigger than here. “We have funding for dancing and music, which I think people would love to hear. Wed love to have tables out there on a nice evening, with a bit of a barbecue and a bit of music. “Youd like to think by September, we should be able to get going.” On the way back through the village, the shutters are half up on the Rio Grande as preparations continue inside. By the time you read this it will have reopened its doors. Hospitality has ed throughout the county, another step on the road to recovery. The farmers outside Greg McElhinneys store now have somewhere  to shoot the breeze. For the next few weeks at least, Covid fears will be drowned out by clink of glasses, the audible relief of the repressed socialite and the laughter of friends reunited. Dancing, however, is still prohibited under the regulations. It may need to be done across Parks Rio Grande, rather than inside it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Filming on The School for Good and Evil is currently continuing in Belfast. However, SDLP councillor Shauna Cusack said Derry had also been considered as a filming base for the movie. Cllr Cusack revealed details of Derrys bid as she put forward a motion at the monthly meeting yesterday of Derry City and Strabane District which called for more to be done to promote the local council region as a destination for the film and broadcast industry. Starring Charlize Theron, Laurence Fishburne and Kerry Washington, The School for Good and Evil is based on a best-selling series of young adult fantasy novels. googletag.cmd.push It is currently being filmed atBelfast Harbour Studios. It is understood the production crew will be in Northern Ireland for at least  weeks and Northern Ireland Screen estimates that it will generate investment of approximately poundm with around  crew working on the film. Speaking at yesterdays meeting, Cllr Cusack said Derry came very close to securing part of the films production. “Regrettably for a number of reasons we lost out to Belfast which as we all know is currently the go-to hub for productions that decide to come here. “Belfast is going from strength to strength and the city is currently hosting two major productions for both Netflix and Paramount along with several other high profile BBC dramas and they are employing over , crew. googletag.cmd.push “I feel that we need to improve our ambition and profile in this sector in order to compete for business. As opposed to waiting for opportunities, to actively seek them. “With the industry booming in both Ireland and the UK, many cities are seeing the benefits of being shovel-ready for companies. “Most cities and councils on these islands have already developed their own film departments to showcase their own locations. We have not.” Cllr Cusack said the success of Derry Girls in particular had shown Derrys potential as a location for TV and film production but added that the council had to be serious about building on that success.     She also asked that the council do more to support and promote young local broadcasting talent. “As a council we need to be moving forward with the times, trends and technology. Film and broadcast is an intrinsic part of every day le now and council need to embrace that. “Ultimately, we want jobs and long-term opportunities to improve lives and the economy here. “Finally, and to steal a line from a famous movie, I firmly believe thatwe build it they will come.” Cllr Cusacks motion was supported by all other parties on the council. Sinn Fein councillor Conor Heaney said the film and TV industry had great potential. “I think it definitely should be a focus for the Business and Culture committee of this council,” he said. The motion was also supported by DUP Alderman Keith Kerrigan who highlighted the impact that the filming of Game of Thrones in Northern Ireland had on the tourism industry. However, Alderman Kerrigan said it was important that the entire council region was marketed and not just the city. People Before Profit councillor Maeve ONeill praised the trailblazers in Derry who had worked in the TV and film industry for many years. She said some of these old hands could be used as part of efforts to develop the local potential. Alliance councillor Rachael Ferguson also highlighted the potential for local colleges to get involved in the initiative. Ulster Unionist councillor Derek Hussey said the motion was a no brainer and he was fully in support of it. Alderman Hussey said he could not understand why a film had never been made about the  Siege of Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Arts Council this week announced funding ofpoundm for arts organisations throughout Northern Ireland. The Arts Council’s Annual Funding Programmeis the most signicant allocation of public funding for the arts in Northern Ireland each year. Void Gallery in Derry is to receive pound,, while Greater Shantallow Community Artsis to be allocated pound,. GSCA aims to provide direct access to the arts for those living in disadvantaged communities. GSCA is core funded by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland which enables the organisation to offer a year-round programme of creative activities benefitting over  people every week, delivered from their community arts centre, Studio . googletag.cmd.push The local group has received Arts Council funding to support the employment of a dance officer to develop their dance classes. Void Gallery’s programme focuses on the collaborative nature of art and its ability to add to artistic discourse through exhibitions, events, discussions and partnerships. Through their commissions they work with a network of arts organisations both nationally and internationally to create specic projects. Liam Hannaway,chair of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, welcomed the latest funding support. “This year’s annual allocation of exchequer and National Lottery funding is largely standstill for most of our key arts organisation,” he said. “In order to mitigate the continuing impact of Covid-, we have already released upfront payments of % of last year’s grant to  applicants. googletag.cmd.push “This offers an element of stability to many amidst current programming and strategic uncertainty, as the sector prepares to reopen. Commenting on the department’s funding allocation to ACNI, Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey,said, said such support was an important part of the foundations on which the work of our vital arts and creative sector is built. “These awards come at a point where the Executive has agreed a series of important relaxations that will make a real dference for participation in the arts and with the Culture, Arts and Heritage Recovery Taskforce beginning its work. “Taken together these represent an important contribution to supporting the peopleand organisations who work across the arts to be able to do their important work.     “I recognise the pressure that continues to be felt financially, creatively and at a personal level across the creative community, even as we begin the process of reopening and recovery. “I also recognise that more support will be needed this year and so I was particularly pleased to welcome the Executive’s decision last week to allocate a further round of poundm Covid funding to Arts, Culture and Heritage to support the social recovery.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His -year playing career ended on the Evergreens in the early s.Joersquos role as match secretary for twenty years was absolutely crucial given his unique ability to dig out players when all seemed lost, recruiting players at Down High on Saturday mornings to fulfil fixtures later that day.Complete strangers would often turn up for second  matches in the early days saying that Joe had instructed them to turn up and play.Despite his tireless work on behalf of the club, Joersquos greatest pleasure throughout his rugby le has been the friends he has made along the way.A keen tourist, he has travelled the world to follow rugby and even took in some of the Lions fixtures in South Africa in .He was tour manager on the legendary  Ballynahinch tour of Canada, as well as partaking in a few trips away with the Evergreens.When promotion to the All-Ireland League was secured in , Joe was a regular spectator at games all over the country and could be seen at every first XV home fixture in his familiar spot on the m line until very recently.The flat cap, long navy Adidas coat, familiar cough and half pint of Harp should conjure up an image of Joe to everyone who knows him, and to countless others who have passed through the Ballynahinch club in recent years not knowing the huge influence he has had on their rugby.Joe is the recipient of the coveted Spence Cup this season. He is truly deserving of this award and it is le-affirming to see that friendships gained through team sports run deep as Sam Robinson, himself a Spence Cup winner, acts as carer for Joe as his health deteriorates.Rugby it seems, is giving something back to one of itrsquos finest local servants.On behalf of the Spence family, Emma Rice commened: ldquoThe Spence Cup is given to a member who shows an example of commitment to the rugby club. Joe Carlislersquos service to the club in time and deed epitomises this.ldquoA society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in. We are often guilty of not noticing a tree that gives the shade we sit under, she continued.ldquoPlayers of today may no longer see as much of that familiar face on the m line at Ballymacarn Park, but they will see the roots, the structure, the shade and benefit from what wee Joe once planted. Thank you and congratulations, Joe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business owners join forces in their love of baking  ","story":"THEY became virtual supporters of each otherrsquos business during lockdown mdash now two women bakers are working together to raise money for dementia research.Ciara Van Vogt, the owner of Margaretrsquos Cottage BB in Ardglass and Sharon Campbell from Mrs Crsquos Home Kitchen in Dundrum, have raised pound, so far for the Alzheimerrsquos Society from an online bake sale.They supported each otherrsquos business efforts through lockdown last year by connecting on social media but did not meet in person until March.When they did, the two ladies struck up an immediate friendship and decided to put their skills together and collaborate on a project.Sharon said: ldquoDuring lockdown charities have really suffered and there are many worthy causes out there, we both agreed it was hard to support just one.ldquoBoth businesses support their own inidual local charities and will continue to do, but we chose to support an Alzheimerrsquos charity because we both know many people affected by this awful disease.Ciara is a carer for her elderly mother, Mrs Eithne Fitzsimons, who was diagnosed with Alzheimerrsquos disease four years ago.ldquoI lose a bit of Mum every week, and sometimes Mum doesnrsquot know who I am, said Ciara.ldquoLockdown has stopped support groups and activities for people with dementia. Itrsquos been very challenging for carers and their loved ones, and people often forget that carersrsquo lives are adversely affected too.ldquoImagine having a spouse or parent who no longer recognises you and who due to this awful disease you no longer recognise.One of the things that resonates with both women is the thought of any loved one losing all our precious memories.Ciara continued: ldquoResearch into the causes of, and treatment for dementia is critically important but not a priority for UK governments.ldquoWe would love to see this dreadful disease eradicated for future generations. We both have strong ties to Northern Ireland, being from here, although we both spent time living and working in England and Scotland before moving home to settle back in Co Down. Our mutual love of baking and cooking was how we met and became friends.The two bakers organised a virtual bake sale to raise money for dementia research.However they soon realised that due to geography not everyone could buy their fabulous baking, so they set up a JustGiving page to run alongside the bake sale.ldquoPlanning the challenges of a bake sale during lockdown was fun, so too was choosing some of our most popular products to sell to raise money, said Sharon.ldquoThe menu proved so popular. Within ten days we both realised we wouldnrsquot get much sleep as baking for Alzheimerrsquos became a top priority.Early mornings and late nights meant that customers received their sweet treats and funds are still being raised by the pair.If you want to check out their Just Giving page, details are: https:www.justgiving fundraising sharonandciarasbakesale and both ladies can be found on Facebook and Instagram..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Campbell.jpg","title":"Campbell on form as Duns claim derby win  ","story":"DUNDRUM firsts defeated derby rivals Downpatrick by  runs on Friday evening to continue their push for a semi-final spot in the T Shield.Dundrum travelled to the Strangford Road after their pitch was deemed unplayable after heavy rain with the home side winning the toss and, on a cold damp evening, chose to field first.Dundrum opened with Greg Hutley and Stuart Campbell while Downpatrick opened the bowling with Justin Rea and Marty Gartland.Dundrum got off to a fast start adding  for the first wicket inside the first six overs before Hutley was dismissed for  off the bowling of Gartland.Dundrumrsquos run rate began to halt as a result of the combination of good Downpatrick bowling and a slow outfield.Terry Hutley and Campbell added  for the next wicket before Dundrum lost four quick wickets in the form of Campbell , Hutley , James Martinand Joel Maguire .This left Dundrum  for five with Downpatrick on top as Ian Wright and Gavin McNerlin added  for the next wicket before another clump of wickets fell to leave Dundrum  for nine after  overs.McNerlin managed to get Dundrum to  for nine from their  overs as he finished on  not out.The pick of the Downpatrick bowlers was James Ferguson who finished with figures of  for  from his four overs and the game was very much in the balance heading into the second innings.Downpatrick opened with brothers Michael and Daniel Carson whilst Dundrum elected to open the bowling with Davy Glover and Daniel Kearsley.Similar to Dundrumrsquos innings, Downpatrick got off to a fast start, putting on  for the first wicket inside the first six overs.The Downpatrick men combined well and began running fluently between the wickets to put the pressure on the Dundrum bowlers.Daniel Carsonwas dismissed off the bowling of Davy Glover after a good catch by Andrew Foster in the dee, with Paul Linehan next to the crease to join Michael Carson.Linehan looked to be aggressive, hitting a big six to keep the pressure on Dundrum as the two batsmen took the score to  for  inside nine overs.However, Dundrum began to fight back through Campbell and McNerlin. The former dismissed both Carson and Linehan in the same over to swing the match back in favour for Dundrum.This started a Downpatrick collapse with the last eight wickets falling for only  runs. McNerlin finished with figures of  for  from four overs while Campbell finished with  for  from his four overs, completing a -run win for Dundrum.It was a fantastic fight back for Dundrum and Downpatrick will know they let the game get away from them.Dundrum would like to thank Downpatrick Cricket Club for hosting the game with the match ball sponsored by Aiden McCabe from AMC building.Dundrum -Downpatrick  all outT SHIELD.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Despair.jpg","title":"Despair for Down in second defeat  ","story":"DOWN were second best to a Meath side who ran out comfortable winners by a margin of seven points at Armaghrsquos Athletic Grounds on Sunday.Down were forfeiting their home advantage as a result of breaching the GAArsquos Covid- regulations during lockdown and perhaps that, coupled with the torrid weather conditions, attributed to their performance.Paddy Tally signicantly reshuffled his starting line-up following their opening day defeat against Mayo in Castlebar.The Down manager made a total of five changes, with goalkeeper Marc Reid and captain Darren OrsquoHagan the most notable of them all.Meath began the sharper of the two sides, but Down could not fault lady luck as their opponents were reduced to  men following a Eoin Harkey black card.The red and black outfit failed to take advantage of their additional man as Meath began scoring points through Cathal Hickey, Mathew Costello and Andrew Colgan.Corey Quinn did manage to score two points before the quarter for the Mourne county, but he also failed to convert a goal scoring chance which set the tone for the afternoon.The game was not away from Down at this stage as Quinn added to his tally alongside scores from Paul Devlin and Ryan McElroy to trail by only two points at half-time.It was a reverse in roles for the second half, as this time it was Down player Jonny Flynn who was shown the black card, leaving his side down a man.Unlike Down, Meath took full advantage of the extra shirt on the pitch and Cillian OrsquoSullivan buried two goals just before and after the third quarter to put the contest out of sight.Referee Niall Cullen was kept busy with his cards, this time displaying a red to Downrsquos Gerard McGovern to close out a miserable afternoon for Tallyrsquos men.Down now travel to Mullingar this Sunday, where they face off against Westmeath at Cusack Park.Down: M Reid P Fegan, G McGovern, P Murdock, P Laverty, D OrsquoHagan, C Mooney, R McEvoy , J Flynn, J Guinness, B OrsquoHagan , L Kerr, D Guinness, C Quinn , P Devlin .Subs: C Doherty for J Guinness , P Branagan for Mooney , S McConville for Kerr , G Collins for D OrsquoHagan , C Gough for Flynn , C McCrickardfor B OrsquoHagan , D Savage for Quinn Meath: A Colgan , S Lavin, C McGill, C Hickey , E Harkin, S McEntee, D Keogan, B Menton, P Harnan, E Devine , B McMahon , M Costello , J Morris , T OrsquoReilly , C OrsquoSullivan .Subs: R Ryan for Harkin , J Wallace for OrsquoReilly , E Wallacefor Hickey , J Scully for McMahon , J Conlon for Morris , D Campion for OrsquoSullivan , G McCoy for McEntee Referee: Niall Cullen Down -Meath -NFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Dozens.jpg","title":"Dozens walk in memory of Seaforde Special Olympian  ","story":"UPWARDS of  people took part in a charity walk around Castlewellan Lake on Saturday in memory of Seaforde man Glenn McBride, who died  weeks ago.Glennwas a medalled Special Olympics competitor who enjoyed soccer and basketball, playing both to a high standard.He was a popular member of of Down Special Olympics Club in Downpatrick and Shimna Stars Special Olympics Club in Newcastle.Glenn won a soccer gold medal with Team Down at the Area Games in Belfast in  and was a member of the Ulster soccer team at the Ireland Games the following year.

But also to strengthen school community and pride in our fantastic school.Mr Austin paid tribute to the schools PTFA for its fundraising, to the board of governors for support and a group of volunteers who worked on the welcome garden.ldquoThe team spirit that has been displayed throughout this project has been uplting and a reflection of the strong school community that exists within St Colmcilles Primary School, he said.ldquoThe board of governors have supported this project throughout and are committed to a cycle of continuous improvement of all aspects of the school, especially its facilities and resourcesHe continued: ldquoThe PTFA have fundraised relentlessly through organising ious raffles, draws, bingos and hampers. They have enjoyed amazing support from our parents and the whole school community who all have been very generous. So far, they have contributed pound, to the project which has allowed us to go the extra mile with more extensive resources and a very high spec finish in the ious areas.He said that the welcome garden was created almost exclusively by volunteers such as grandparent Stephen Vaughan, who built the planter boxes, the garden furniture was designed and constructed by brothers Lawrence and Gareth Blaney, the circular stone planter built by parent Fergus Rooney , grounds work was carried out by Pascal Magee and planting by Bill Carew. Plants and shrubs were provided at a discounted rate from Cunningham Flowers in Dundrum.The schoolrsquos head of outdoor education, Sean McReynolds, oversaw the project with building supervisors Brian Tweedie and Bill Carew, classroom assistant Ryan Craig and Gemma Vaughan, the schoolrsquos eco co-ordinator.Parent Roisin McKenna, who along with Andrea McMenamin, Natasha Shields and Rosaleen Cunlfe leads the PTFA committee, said that they had enjoyed ldquoamazing support from parents, the wider school community and local businesses.Roisin said: ldquoThe ethos of our PTFA is about \"making memories\" and this is always at the forefront of our fundraising. We wanted the money we raised to benefit every child in the school and therefore the school have all the children timetabled for outdoor learning everyday.ldquoThis makes our fundraising all worthwhile when you see happy children playing daily outdoors.The PTFA organised fundraising initiatives like bingo, raffles, hampers and draws which have allowed the school to further develop the footprint of the planned facilities for the children.The schoolrsquos Rainbow garden includes a tepee, a water wall for directing and controlling the flow of water, an activity table, a water and sand tray, outdoor shelter, sensory plants with a vivid colour or smell and plastic coated activity table where children can paint use sand and textiles to show their learning.Therersquos also an outdoor classroom which can hold up to  pupils and adults with bespoke seating and a blackboard with outdoor musical equipment.Itrsquos contained within ranch style fencing and is very popular with all the schoolrsquos pupils, particularly those within its learning support centres, many of whom have complex sensory needs.The new play park contains swings, slide, climbing tower, monkey bars, balance equipment, ropes, seesaws seating and planting areas.Children are timetabled at break and lunch times and for certain lessons throughout the day.An eye-catching circular stone planter has been filled with a iety of shrubs and trees in the new Welcome garden.Therersquos also a bespoke reading area overlooking four large rectangular sleeper planter boxes filled with beautul summer flowers, a solar powered water fountain, a bird bath and bird tables..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Politicians.jpg","title":"Politicians gather to mark Northern Ireland centenary  ","story":"CROSSGAR marked Northern Irelandrsquos centenary on Monday with a special event.A number of local politicians including South Down MLA Harry Harvey and Rowallane councillors Billy Walker, Terry Andrews, Robert Burgess and Kathryn Owen met in the village square with each holding a torch which symbolised what happened in Crossgar a century ago when the province was formed.On that occasion, a bonfire was lit in the square by local residents to celebrate the creation of Northern Ireland on election night of the new parliament.The local MP was Sir James Craig, the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who had personal ties to Crossgar and had been its Westminster MP since .To mark the national and local event, local politicians from all parties were invited to hold a flame in a triangular shape on Monday symbolising the fire that was lit on the birth of the country in .Cllr Walker said he was delighted to have been invited to Crossgar to take part in the special event to mark Northern Irelandrsquos th birthday..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to Down Rec soccer legend Jim Connolly  ","story":"JIM Connolly died on April  after a hard fought two year battle with illness.His passing was marked by a phenomenal level of tributes.Social media,work colleagues, team-mates and opponents alike expressed how well liked and respected he was in all walks of le.He was first and last a family man whether it was his brothers and sisters, Angie and his children or his beloved grandchildren.However Coot, as he was known, had another family which he held dear. He had been a vital cog in the Down Rec team which enjoyed great success in the late Seventies.But it was and remains the case that the Down Rec experience is defined by the enduring friendships which have stood the test of time.Coot grew up in Stream Street and the reason he knocked back opportunities to perform at levels his talent merited may well lie there.That part of Downpatrick had three working class housing developments, Ardpatrick and Russell Park with Stream Street and Ibrox Park in the middle.Ibrox was their playground, the place where Coot first kicked a football.He was a Stream Street kid and it seems he never wanted to be anything .When Jim Prior took him to Down Rec, it was a marriage made in heaven.In that dressing room you had another more senior Stream Street kid. Coot would have idolized Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran in those days as he was the leader of the pack.Russell Park resident Barney Fitzsimmons was there too, a swashbuckling goalscorer who enjoyed something akin to Roy of the Rovers status at the time.Then you had the late great Paddy lsquoGeordyrsquo Galbraith, who combined a hard man reputation with a heart of gold.Peter Mulhall was another player he would have admired, a winner who proved the perfect centre back partner for the laid-back Coot.The total respect he had for them was accorded to all of us even though he was a better player than any of us. That was Coot Connolly.Prior realized that he needed to recruit from outside Downpatrick to fulfill his ambitions for the club and over a period of time he recruited players from Portaferry, Strangford, Ardglass, Dundrum, Crossgar, Saintfield, Killyleagh and Ballygowan.They were brought in for their ability but Jim couldnrsquot have known that the erse personalities therein would create the perfect storm in the dressing room.Neither could he have anticipated the level of support which flowed from those villages in the seasons to come.Dressing rooms are bastions of banter and slagging and with Dart jester-in chief, the group relished every minute they spent together.The five strong Portaferry contingent proved to be a vital ingredient, their earthy Ards humour and the opportunities their accents provided for slagging sealing their popularity.Jackie Leckey and Barney Ross brought another dimension willing as they were to join in the shenanigans on and off the pitch. Coot loved the craic and happily joined in the banter.However, he left the slagging to other less sensitive creatures of which there were plenty.A good example was the time I decided to get the footballers perm which was in vogue at the time. I should have known better.I got slaughtered, Dart declaring that I looked more like Shirley Temple than Kevin Keegan.Those were the days, as the saying goes, but happily there were plenty of good days ahead of us.We have had many reunions with Coot, an ever present and every one of them underlined the strength of the bond we enjoy so much.Sadly those reunions tend to be confined to wakes and funerals nowadays and the baby of our team has now joined Shane Breen, Paddy Galbraith and Marty Ross on the sidelines.Coot would have been the first to remind me that the Rec wasnrsquot only about the players.The one and only Charlie Oakes was highly influential in his role as assistant manager, while Austy Keating doubled as chairman and groundsman for many years.Joe Lyttle was our physio and his son Joea loyal player for years while my sister Tina was a committee member and a fanatical fan.They were all fully paid up members of the Rec family and we continue to mourn their loss.I would love to have name checked every single member of the Rec family in this piece but time and space didnrsquot allow. My apologies.The laughter which rang through Cootrsquos house during his wake was a fitting farewell for someone who loved to laugh.He was a very special human being. We will miss him forever.

Ben Lowry writes: \"We should emphasise our integral place in one of the great parliamentary democracies, in a country that is a world leader in science and arts, and our shared history and institutions such as theBBC\"A moderate Ulster Unionist Party and a conservative DUP.Instead, there was drama in the DUP, which reflected unionist confusion. But unionism can be open minded and generous on a wide range of issues while standing firm on these principles:. Challenge the idea of a ‘process’ That republican concept of a peace ‘process’ is used to move Northern Ireland halfway between the UK and Republic of Ireland, via small concessions . But the UK hasagreed that Scotland and Northern Ireland can leave on a % +  vote. Spain, Canada, France, the US, do not make it so easy for their regions to go. UK nationalists have won an advantage that is the dream of separatists where. In , there must be no dilution of sovereignty unless and until there is a vote to go.. Three strands must be observedLast year the DUP let Dublin jointly author a deal toStormont that included policy pledges that were Strand One matters . Doug Beattie wanted the UUP to go into opposition then. If the assembly falls again, there need to be clear demarcation as to which political talks involve Irish officials, particularly given that Ireland pushes nationalist concerns while the UK stays neutral.. SF won’t get reward for collapseSinn Fein brought down Stormont over RHI yet its only unwavering red line for ato devolution was an Irish language act . Unionists let their reasonable opposition to blackmail be depicted as ‘both sides’ having red lines. They should never again endorse a deal that rewards blackmail. . Beware of culture warsShowing proper respect for Gaelic culture such as language and sport is essential, but should not tip into weakness in the face of openly stated republican aims to use culture to secure political advance. . Seek friends across IrelandThe republican electoral march on both sides of the border is not inevitable as shown by the  general election, and the slow SF Dail advance in the decade after .Nationalist Ireland was ambivalent about the IRA in the Troubles, reflected in Irish extradition policy, but support for the Provisionals was small. Among NI Catholics, %+ consistently voted against Sinn Fein after they began contesting elections in the s. The Republic was even more anti. SF got %-% until after the  Belfast Agreement.Unionists have rarely courted Sinn Fein critics, even those who became Taoiseach . Such leaders need support, given that elements of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael seem happy, even keen, to usher SF into power. . Develop diplomatic skillsNorthern Ireland unionists seem to have few friends, yet the pool of potential allies is vast in England and Wales, given shared history. Scotland, even more so.Much of the American establishment still sees itself as Scots Irish . And many more are fond of the British link, despite the historic breach, and could be sympathetic to points such as NI’srole in the still close UK-US alliance.I have also seen curious visitors, who have no prior Northern Ireland link, arrive here branding unionists as oppressors but leave seeing them as a vulnerable minority.. Don’t let NI be a ‘place apart’A nationalist strategy, in Scotland and Northern Ireland, is to make it so dferent from England and Wales as to be unrecognisable as part of the UK.NI unionists are acquiescing in this, in part due to confusion about what is local and what is national. Core issues such as defence and trade are decided at national level of any state, something the NI protocol shatters .The Tory Henry Hill wants a new Campaign for Equal Citizenship for Northern Ireland within the UK.. Challenge misuse of ‘rights’Gerry Adams reportedly said “what’s going to break them is equality”. Influential people of a similar mindset seem to think the citing of ‘human rights’ in court to change policy will do the same. The  Stormont deal advanced a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, which republicans hope will separate us from GB and ultimately to strike down laws. No unionist should back it.. Don’t be mercenary about moneyMoney is the benefit unionists most cite about the UK but a grasping approach alienates people in GB. We should emphasise our integral place in one of the great parliamentary democracies, in a country that is a world leader in science and arts, and our shared history and institutions such as theBBC.. Pay heed to history and legacyThe IRA have made legacy a priority and are turning the narrative against state forces who prevented civil war. The problem is rooted in unionist neglect of history. I attended two schools that were culturally British, yet was being exposed to text books in the s that subtly pushed the apartheid NI lie .. Don’t fuel the New Ireland pushThe Republic has changed radically since , when Home Rule really was Rome Rule, but Brexit has also revealed an enduring anglophobia. Unionists should stop giving cover to an ‘old’ united Ireland plan, to shunt us out of a society of  million people into an small island unit that will align itself with Germany and France before recognising the huge historic British contribution to this island. Celebrate the NI centenaryThe downplaying of the centenary of our country, Northern Irleand, is a scandal. But as we emerge from lockdown we still have six months to celebrate, in a non tribal way, what London won’t.. Reject the NI ProtocolThere are strong pragmatic arguments for the protocol but they are not unionist ones. Yet Edwin Poots seems as pragmatic about the Irish Sea border as was Arlene Foster. Doug Beattie said on Good Morning Ulster this week that the NHS was more important than the protocol. Why keep unionist in the title of his partyso The UK has said in court that the Act of Union is repealed. That has to be the number one issue for anyone whose objective is staying in one of the greatest nations in history.. Unionists are not AllianceThe Alliance Party vote has risen to %+. But unionism on a bad day still gets %. Some people are talking up the Alliance surge to get unionists to move closer to a position of agnosticism on the Union. Don’t. . Get tough on securitySee on page  a bid for tougher on terror sentencing in GB. Yet NI is still soft about dissident bail and sentencing. Unionists should demand Stormont gets robust on those who kill.. Conscience is privateSame-sex relations, abortion, etc are conscience issues.

I thought of Jesussaying ‘I am the vine and you are the branches, whatever you do to the least of these you do to me.’ I knewthen that Itoo wanted to be transformed. Once I discerned the call, I felt this burning joy and peace, and after that everything went very quickly. The Lord just went ‘right, let’s go’. “Within weeks I was at the convent. I found the courage to speak to the superior, I loved it and I knew that was where I wanted to be.”Martina thrived while living in community at the convent, and although people might assume that a le of being sequestered and engaged in quiet prayer and reflection might be dull, she says it was anything but, intense in fact, living with the other sisters and praying for others in the community who were seeking spiritual succour.She was obliged to leave the convent before taking her final vows last October last year when the church ruled that the congregation did not have the resources, structures and capacity to continue. It was a challenging time: ”Butyou want to serve God there is always a cross, and you have to be prepared for an ordeal. There are roses and thorns. “When I left the convent it was dficult but I went off with my friend and sister in the Lord Elaine Kelly . We went off like Peter and Paul and found a new way of serving God by taking people on what is a pilgrimage based on the le of St Patrick, walking miles each day and being immersed in the countryside which Patrick always said was of the Most High God.”When she is not guiding people along St Patrick’s Way in Downpatrick, she prays for our politicians and that peace will prevail: “I feel, having thought deeply about it, that the Troubles here happened because our ties to our cultural and political allegiances were greater than our ties to Christ. Christ is God who is love and in Him is perfect peace. There is so much pain here and more than ever we need God, we need peace and we need love.”‘God is with us in our darkest moments’As a devout, now laicised Christian, Martina has thought much about the struggle of le and the harsh reality that while God is clearly manest in the world, this does not remove the manold forms of suffering that we as human beings endure, no matter how strong our faith or how robust our moral fibre.One of her favourite books on the subject is Making Sense Out of Suffering by Peter Kreeft. “It tells you that suffering is not without meaning, that le is a fairytale and God is the ultimate writer of fairytales. But thehappy ending may not happen in this le. God suffers with us and there is a gt in it. “It cannot be avoided but you will gain something from it, evenyou cannot see that at the time. “There is purpose and ultimately a gt in what we endure and again we must always remember that God suffers alongside us and is perhaps closest to us in our darkest moments.”‘We must not make  gods out of flags or patriotism in the pursuit of peace’Martina admits she was a goody two-shoes at convent school in Toronto, Canada where she emigrated with her family from west Belfast at the height of the Troubles. The family had wanted to escape the worst of the conflict, but the young Martina missed her native city, her granny and her cousins deeply.She remembers the strangeness of Canada at first, walking through heavy snow, the dferent vocabulary, the strange accents and towering buildings.“The only time I was ever in trouble was when I was late with ing library books,” she laughs, “and my punishment was dusting shelves in the library for two weeks.”She excelled at English, but describes herself as an average student and when she arrived in Canada was a source of fascination for other children in her class because she ‘talked funny’.She ed to Northern Ireland to pursue a career in journalism in , first working at the Irish News, then on the business desk and then as political correspondent at the Belfastbefore following her colleague Mark Simpson to the BBC in .Always perfectly cofured and poised on camera she quickly gained a reputation as an astute reporter and able inquisitor of politicians with a straight-talking approach, always much kinder and softer, though arguably no less effective, than Jeremy Paxman.When she left the BBC in October  she recalls that some of her colleagues there initially thought it was a joke. But of course it was anything but.“I had felt the call to religious le for quite some time, I had tried charity work but I realised I wanted to be closer to God and devote myself to him entirely. When I joined the Adoration Sisters people assumed it must have been boring compared to the high-octane pace of daily political journalism, but it was just as intense in a dferent way. It’s not just sitting about quietly engaged in prayerful reflection, it’s about trying to serve God in your heart and soul and praying for others, including politicians and ordinary people who would call into the convent that they might find His strength and courage in whatever they were pursuing or engaged in or in grappling with their problems.”Martina has thought a lot about the horror of the Troubles, our political representatives and how we might have been able to avoid conflictwe had stayed closer to His message of peace and love.“I think a lot of people have made  gods out of flags and patriotism instead of serving Christ. And serving Him is the only way.”QA: ‘I’d bring Jesus and Bruce Springsteen to a dinner party’Tell us your earliest childhood memories In Belfast playing in the garden in Ladybrook Park. Then our first Christmas in Canada where my family and I moved to avoid the conflict. I was six and I remember getting a doll’s house and a sewing machine and being especially delighted about that.\u2028School days - the happiest of your le My father used to say, ‘these are the happiest days of your le’. And I would think, ‘God, I hope not.’ I liked English, hated maths, but I was happy. I went to a convent school but I was glad to get out. I was late quite a lot in the mornings.The happiest time in my le so far was probably the five years I spent with the Adoration Sisters on the Falls Road and even though I had to leave the convent last year without taking my vows, I am still very happy because I now get to tell people all about St Patrick, and lead them on this beautul trail, walking miles each day in my hiking boots.\u2028Tell us your ideal way to spend a day outside of lockdown restrictions A day of retreat. I would go to the Holy Cross Abbey in Rostrevor. There are beautul walks there.\u2028Who is your best friend After Jesus, my friend Elaine Kelly, a former barrister who entered the Adoration Sisters around the same time as me. She is my sister in the Lord and now we live together in Downpatrick. We thought, Jesus sent them out in pairs, and so we found a way to continue our mission together like Peter and Paul. We work on the St Patrick’s Trail in Downpatrick together.\u2028Who in your le makes you laugh the most I think Imake myself laugh. Or Elaine. But she’s more of the straight person. I tell thejokes.\u2028If you could have a dream dinner party at which you could invite anyone at all, alive or dead, who would you bring I would bring the Lord, obviously. He is the greatest artist, the greatest politician, the greatest everything, He speaks every language and He has all knowledge, who wouldn’t want Him at dinner  I know He’s risen so I want to hear all about that. Then Mary and Joseph, St Patrick, who is immensely interesting and brought Christianity to Ireland building on the existent Celtic spirituality, and Bruce Springsteen, whose music I love and who I think is very spiritual, and Winston Churchill.\u2028And what would you serve them to eat and drink Roast lamb with parsnips and roast potatoes and plenty of good wine.\u2028Can you describe yourself in three words Elaine has four - kind, pure-hearted, but vicious and demanding!\u2028Love is....Mercy.\u2028The meaning of le is...To know, love and serve God.  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularSam McBride: Edwin Poots has won three times in a month – but he’s losing a bigger battleAfter dispatching Arlene Foster, Edwin Poots faces a mutinous DUPBen Lowry: There is much confusion in unionism, so here are some suggested core pro Union principlesSam McBride: A broken Whitehall which knew more about China than about NIDr Christian Jessen seeks public help to fight Arlene Foster libel damagesMost PopularDUP in crisis - PSNI receive complaint that DUP members were allegedly threatened and intimidated by UDAIt seems now that only Jim Allister is determined to scrap the Northern Ireland ProtocolRev Ivan Foster: As long as unionists care chiefly about their salary, nothing will changeOlder Northern Ireland mums: ‘Someone asked memy baby son was my grandson’Sam McBride: After four years at the top of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill has good reason to be nervous                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kafWEX sc-feJyhm dbjzDR\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedFashion and BeautyDealsHome and GardenPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...The source said that North Antrim MP Ian Paisley Jr’s claim on Thursday night that his father had died of a broken heart after being toppled as DUP leader in  had exposed a key source of the party’s ision.They said: “Ian’s contribution was really signicant in laying bare the real reason for a lot of this. It’s about ing the DUP to its roots.”However, a source on Mr Poots’s side of the party said that it had been a power struggle and that those who until now had been the party establishment “just can’t come to terms with the fact that they’ve lost power”.Sir Jeffrey, outgoing leader Arlene Foster, Economy Minister Diane Dodds, East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson, East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell and others then walked out during an interval in the meeting, pointedly not staying to listen to the new leader’s acceptance speech.Former Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP constituency association chairman Paul Bell resigned on the steps of the Crowne Plaza hotel where the meeting was happening, telling reporters that senior party figures acted to “assassinate our leader”.However, he inadvertently confirmed something which earlier in the week Mrs Foster has questioned — the existence of the letter of no confidence which persuaded her to walk away.Mrs Foster had said that she had not seen the letter and suggested it might not exist, but Mr Bell said: “I think that those  members have a lot to think about — that signed that letter [sic]”.Veteran BBC political corespondent Gareth Gordon, who spent Thursday night at the hotel reporting on the drama, said yesterday: “The poison that’s pouring out is just incredible. It’s almost asit’s been kept bottled up for years ... nobody is trying to hide it.”Yesterday did not see a slew of public resignations from the party, but there was a mutinous atmosphere among many of those who opposed Mr Poots for the leadership.Some senior figures on Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s side of the party are considering radical options.Last night one such inidual did not dismiss the idea of a string of unionist independents banding together in an alliance — although they accepted that there is not space for a fourth major unionist party.When askedthe imperative to unite for next year’s crucial assembly election will bring the party together behind the new leader or whether the isions are too deep to be bridged, he said: “I think it’s the latter more than the former. “We will lose people.”He added that it was “a huge mistake on Edwin’s part” to deny the party executive a secret vote on whether to raty him as leader.As the party spin about being a “family” was exposed, last night the PSNI confirmed they were investigatinga complaint that members of the party had been threatened during the leadership contestJournalist Rodney Edwards reported that Sir Jeffrey told Thursday night’s meeting that the UDA had “threatened” some of his team during the contest.The DUP said in a statement: “There was no intimidation or bullying. Any suggestions are baseless and without foundation. “Executive members freely expressed their opinions without fear or favour.”Mr Poots yesterday condemned the allegation and said that the police should deal with it.Yesterday Mrs Foster confirmed that she plans to leave the DUP and local politics entirely when she resigns as first minister. And the DUP leader threatened to quit that post next weekMr Poots decides to carry a reshuffle of the party’s ministerial team.When askedshe had any regrets, she said: “All of us are going to look back and wish we had done some things dferently. But it’s important to learn from that – everyone makes mistakes, but we should use the lessons from this to move forward.”Yesterday former DUP councillor Guy Spence, who quit the party last year in circumstance which have not been publicly explained, said on Twitter: “When I felt the wrath of the twisted, bitter, hateful culture of the DUP over a year ago I asked the leadership for an investigation.“They washed their hands and looked the other way without responding, instead focusing on spin and deflection.“A year on, they now know what it feels like as the stench brewing on their watch has erupted all over themselves.”Reflecting on the public stre, former DUP MLA David McIlveen said that “the ramications for the unionist family are potentially catastrophic”.He told the Nolan Show that  was “a year in which unionism should have been rejuvenating itself” as it marked the centenary but instead the DUP was tearing itself apart.The former North Antrim MLA said that “the only losers in this are unionism” and that for those losing positions at the top of the DUP “le will go on for them”, but unionism will suffer.Mr McIlveen, the son of Free Presbyterian minister the Rev David McIlveen, said that “there is a culture of fear within the party” and that “no lessons have been learned” by the party since the RHI scandal.New Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie, whose ratication as leader on Thursday was as smooth as the DUP’s was messy, said that his party was talking to at least five DUP councillors but they must “share our vision” before joining.:Sam McBride: A curious episode shows that the NI protocol is now too confusing for even the EU to understandSam McBride: After four years at the top of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill has good reason to be nervousSam McBride: Rather than a DUP lurch to the right, this is about toppling the old orderSam McBride: Is stolen Northern Bank cash in politics  Alarmingly, no one seems botheredSam McBride: How Arlene Foster fell: Even as she dismissed the threat, the knives were being plungedAs Edwin Poots steps forward to contest DUP leadership, Peter Robinson urges cautionSam McBride: The most important firm in Northern Ireland you’ve probably never heard of – but are paying forSam McBride: On the streets and in Stormont, the next few months look bleak for Northern IrelandAnarchy on the Shankill as men and women urge children to riot, with no hint of political protestLeaked internal DUP minutes show fear of looming electoral collapse, and dismay at party’s directionBrandon Lewis interview: Denial of the Irish Sea border is gone as SoS says parts of frontier are being ditched for good——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He raised concerns that the hundreds of new houses in and around Llantwit Major arenrsquot seeing the increased investment in local public services needed to cater for the growing population.He said: ldquoThere are more and more houses in the town. Therersquos hardly any green space left and our services are really struggling.Two doctors surgeries currently cater for the town: Coastal Vale and Western Vale. Cllr John claimed Coastal Vale is ldquoat capacity and the Western Vale building is ldquoover  years old.He said: ldquoThe actual building needs replacing, itrsquos not in a great condition. It needs replacing and modernising.Cardf and Vale UHB is drawing up plans for major changes on how clinical services are delivered. This will likely see three lsquohealth and wellbeing centresrsquo with services like x-rays, out-of-hours GPs, community mental health teams, and ambulatory care.MORE NEWS:The health board is also planning nine lsquowellbeing hubsrsquo, either developing existing places like health centres, leisure centres or libraries or in new buildings such as Maelfa in Cardf. These wellbeing hubs will include GP services, midwery, and primary mental health care.     The idea is to move clinical services away from large hospitals like the University Hospital of Wales, at the Heath in Cardf, avoiding the need for people to travel long distances for care.Cllr John supports this move but says residents in the western part of the Vale of Glamorgan are currently undeserved with health services mdash and with the hundreds of new houses being built in the area, Llantwit would be ideal for a new health centre.He is hoping to get many more signatures for his petition to build the new health centre in Llantwit Major, with a table set up on the precinct in the town on Saturday, for residents who arenrsquot on the internet or havenrsquot seen the campaign online yet.He said: ldquoItrsquos all very well building homes, thatrsquos fine. But we have to have the infrastructure.The health board said any investment in new health and wellbeing centres or wellbeing hubs is some time away.A Cardf and Vale UHB spokesperson said: ldquoThe intention is for a wellbeing hub to be placed in the western Vale, but this may be some years away as part of our overall plan. In terms of where the site will be based, this will be subject to an engagement process.ldquoThere will be a health and wellbeing centre in the Vale work will be commencing in terms of engagement in relation to this within the next few months.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoAny need for a new medical centre would be a matter for the Cardf and Vale University Health Board.ldquoNo planning application for such a building has been submitted and currently the land in question has been allocated as a signicant strategic development site for the councilrsquos house building programme.
