Off-licence sales, however, continued to increase.\u0027Online shopping has again surged as people purchased goods from their homes.\u0027Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte, said: \u0027The UK\u0027s first full month of lockdown measures exposed a sharp ide in retail, not only between those in food and non-food, but also between online and in-store sales as physical shops closed.\u0027Food sales volumes have fallen this month, down 4.1 per cent, as initial consumer stockpiling eased and supply chains caught up with the increased demand. \u0027However, in a significant jump, online food sales now account for 9.3 per cent of all food sales, testament to the ability of supermarkets to pivot supply chains and boost their online platforms to manage more home deliveries.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Coronavirus Mortgage holiday scheme extended THREE MONTHS","story":"Share this article \u0027That’s why we’re working with the banks and lenders to extend payment holidays if people need them.\u0027Everyone’s circumstances will be different, so when homeowners can pay some or all of their mortgage, they should work with their lender on a plan but if they are still struggling, I want them to know that help is there.\u0027New draft guidance for lenders on how the Government expects them to proceed and the options available to customers was today published by the Financial Conduct Authority. Options include extending the application period for a mortgage holiday until October 31. That means that homeowners who have not yet had a payment holiday but who are now experiencing financial difficulty will be able to request one.Meanwhile, an existing ban on the repossession of homes will be continued to the same date. Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at the FCA, said: \u0027Our expectations are clear – anyone who continues to need help should get help from their lender.        \u0027We expect firms to work with customers on the best options available for them, paying particular attention to the needs of their vulnerable customers, and to provide information on where to access help and advice.\u0027Where consumers can afford to re-start mortgage payments, it is in their best interests to do so. \u0027But where they can’t, a range of further support will be available. People who are struggling and have not had a mortgage payment holiday, will also continue to be able to apply until 31 October.\u0027 The new guidance will come into effect after a short consultation with lenders who will then be expected to contact customers whose mortgage holiday is coming to an end.For those who are unable to restart full payments they could pay a proportion of the monthly amount or temporarily switch to an interest only mortgage. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ecb5b8afbb1197d37d96eeef53be51485a0c039/0_731_1413_847/master/1413.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa2bcfd7797daa793c7c3f3ff6a70b99","title":"its brought home the value of these roles lockdowns private sector heroes","story":"When the UK population was told to stay indoors, one maintenance team in Chester refused to let people in need of vital supplies go without. Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

As an eight-year-old, she said, older boys would wait for her after school, “fill bubblegum wrappers with mud and get me down and shove them into my mouth and say, ‘That’s what you should eat, because you’re from a mud hut,’ and then I’d get beaten up.”Kay, who won the  fiction prize for her novel Trumpet and was awarded an MBE for services to literature in 2006, was being interviewed by the STV Player series In Conversation with Bernard Ponsonby.She did not blame the children who bullied her for their racism, she said, telling Ponsonby that “children are not really racist it’s their households, and it’s the teachers … The teachers at my school often came out with out-and-out racist things. They’d talk about ‘darkies’ or say to me, ‘Oh you should be good at this one, because your people have it in their blood,’ if we were doing a dance,” she said. “It’s endemic racism, something that is in the very structures and fabric of our society. I remember the Enoch Powell Rivers of Blood speeches in the 70s and friends of mine saying, ‘Yeah they should all be sent back – oh, not you Jackie – but they should be sent back,’ so adults are saying things like that, too.”Scotland has changed dramatically, Kay said, although people still regularly ask about her roots: “Even just the other day, this taxi driver said, ‘Where are you from?’ and I said Glasgow and he went, ‘Oh, how do you explain that tan?’ … The image of a Scottish person isn’t me, and I think that we need to try and change what we think of when we think of a Scottish person.”She had, she told Ponsonby, been on “an extraordinary journey”, from feeling she didn’t belong as a child, to being the makar. On a recent trip to Uist, she said, there was a “massive” crowd to see her, and she mentioned to the woman driving her around that she hadn’t expected “the huge lesbian turnout”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5cf8e67c65ad3b1608c8c64fbec30398697dca5/0_134_2217_1330/master/2217.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b98bf80db24d7e716ac031ac7a24115","title":"tv account of 1970s feminist history not very good says gloria steinem hay festival","story":"In interview for Hay festival feminist writer says Mrs America misrepresents equal rights movementIt stars Cate Blanchett and Rose Byrne in a glossy, big-budget TV account of 1970s feminist history but one key player who was there, Gloria Steinem, is withering: it is ridiculous, undermining and just not very good, she said on Friday.Steinem, arguably the world’s most famous feminist, has revealed she is not a fan of the new Hulu TV show Mrs America, which premiered in the US last month and is coming to BBC2 in the UK later in the year.The show stars Byrne as Steinem and Blanchett as her rightwing nemesis, Phyllis Schlafly, who is seen leading the fight against the equal rights amendment.Steinem was due to make her first appearance at the Hay festival this year. Now cancelled, she is one of the first interviewees for a reconvened online version, speaking to the writer Laura Bates on Friday about her new book, The Truth Will Set You Free, But First It Will Piss You Off!Steinem was asked for advice on how to deal with women who were not feminists and perpetuated sexism.They existed, Steinem said. “But what is important to remember is, though women may be a problem for other women, they don’t have the power to be the big problem. Women may be adversaries, but we don’t have the power to be our worst adversaries.“For instance, there’s now a not very good series here called Mrs America and it gives you the impression that … Schlafly, who was a very religious and rightwing woman who opposed the equal rights amendment … it gives you the impression that she was the reason it was defeated.“In actuality, I don’t believe she changed one vote. Nobody could ever discover that she changed even one vote. The insurance industry here opposed the equal rights amendment because if they stopped segregating their actuarial tables it would cost them millions upon millions of dollars.”Schlafly was someone “brought in at the last minute” to make it seem that women opposed equal rights when the truth was “the vast majority” always supported it, Steinem said.“The series makes it seem as if women are our own worst enemies, which keeps us from recognising who our worst enemies are. Not that we aren’t in conflict, yes we are in conflict, but by and large we don’t have the power to be our own worst enemies.”Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, said the media often set up debates with token women, seeking to create a “cat fight as a means of undermining feminist argument”.Steinem agreed. “That’s the problem with this ridiculous television show. I’m sure the actors in it are fine, it’s just the thrust of the story is the problem.”Mrs America was created by the former Mad Men writer and producer Dahvi Waller, who has stressed it is not a biopic of Schlafly or Steinem. It also stars Uzo Aduba as Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress and Tracey Ullman as Betty Friedan, the author of The Feminine Mystique.Steinem, 86, talked about the importance of feminists of all ages working together. “Segregating by age is as ridiculous and destructive as segregating by race or class or gender or anything else. We learn from each other. We need each other.”Bates said she still found girls in schools who felt they were a lone feminist voice. “There are these girls everywhere who think that they are the only one and who are on the verge of giving up and who feel completely defeated and are lambasted by their peers … they are called feminazis, they are made fun of, they are ridiculed.”What would Steinem’s message be to those girls?“I would say to her … trust that voice inside you and find a listener and a friendly voice somewhere. Maybe you’re not finding it in your classroom but maybe there is somebody in your neighbourhood, just somebody you feel drawn to. Talk to that person … Trust your own wisdom.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4734cde7e7424113d4a2a3efa010aebfa08913b2/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6151913ba2e4a782a9f9ac66449605ea","title":"what would negative interest rates mean for mortgages and savings","story":"Variable-rate mortgages may fall a little, and it seems unlikely banks will charge to hold savingsThe governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has paved the way for negative interest rates, saying officials are actively considering all options to prop up the economy.If it’s a fixed-rate mortgage, nothing. And most households are on this type of deal – in recent years around nine in 10 new mortgages have been taken on a fixed rate.If it is a variable-rate mortgage – a tracker, or a mortgage on or linked to a lender’s standard variable rate – the rate could fall a little if the base rate is cut. But the drop is likely to be limited by terms and conditions. David Hollingworth, of the mortgage brokers London \u0026amp Country, says trackers sold very recently have in some cases had a “collar” that prevents the lender from having to cut the rate at all. Skipton building society, for example, has a tracker at 1.29 percentage points above the base rate that can only go up.You will need to dig out your paperwork to see how low your mortgage rate could go.Tracker mortgages have been pulled and repriced with larger margins, to cushion lenders against falling rates. If rates are cut again, expect more of that, as well as the collars already seen on some deals.A negative base rate means banks and building societies have to pay to keep money on deposit, and it is designed to discourage them from doing so and make them keen to lend. Andrew Hagger, the founder of the financial information website Moneycomms, says he thinks it is unlikely banks will start charging people to hold their everyday savings. “Many would just withdraw cash and possibly keep it in the house, thus opening a can of worms around security and break-ins,” he says. “However, if the Bank of England did introduce negative rates, I’m sure we would see even more savings accounts heading towards zero.”Rachel Springall, from the data firm Moneyfacts, says: “The most flexible savings accounts could face further cuts should base rate move any lower or if savings providers decide they want to deter deposits.”She is not ruling out a charge for deposits. “Some savings accounts could go down this path – similar to how some banks charge a fee on a current account,” she says.“It could be that super-rich clients in the UK get charged a similar fee as the commercial banks may wish to discourage large cash holdings which they are having to pay for,” says Hagger.Personal loan rates are already low and are usually fixed, so you will not see your monthly repayments fall if rates go down. Credit card rates are usually low for new customers, but rise far above the base rate once introductory periods have ended, so will not be anywhere close to falling into negative territory.Hagger says he does not expect card or loan rates to plummet in the near future, “as I think banks will continue to tighten their credit underwriting – I think they’ll be more concerned about rising bad debt levels due to a surge in unemployment, for the remainder of 2020 at least.”This month Virgin Money closed the credit card accounts of 32,000 borrowers after carrying out “routine affordability checks”. It later reversed the decision, but this could be a sign that lenders are reviewing their customer bases and trying to reduce their risk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5def9de8afcd2dbb3a0200e5f47216cdd679ff89/514_33_2792_1675/master/2792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf6d3a0135aa48eee27f06637905deb9","title":"burberry cancels dividend sales plunge covid 19","story":"Luxury brand axes payment to shareholders worth about £120m amid Covid-19 crisisThe luxury British brand, best known for its trenchcoats and signature check, said it was cancelling its end-of-year payment to shareholders, worth about £120m last year, and had borrowed £300m via the UK government-backed business support scheme after the sales slump in the three months to 28 March.The company said it was sticking to its commitment not to burn unsold stock and would be clearing excess product by moving it to parts of the world where stores were now trading and through online discounts, sample sales for employees and recycling.Burberry said it could not predict sales and profits for the year ahead as it would take some time for luxury shopping to return to normal levels across the world in the light of the pandemic.“The virus has clearly changed the world and the way people conduct their lives. There will be significant pressure on the luxury consumer. Social distancing will inevitably slow down economic trade,” said Julie Brown, the chief operating and financial officer.The company said that half of its stores were currently closed and trading in the three months to the end of June was likely to be “severely impacted”.Burberry said it was reviewing its store estate in Hong Kong as Brown said it was clear that tourist destinations, in Asia and Europe, were likely to have fewer visitors for the time being.She said online shopping and digital communication with shoppers would also be more important, and Burberry’s investment in those areas meant it was well placed to cope with the current environment.The company said trading in China started to improve in March and it had reopened all stores there but the number of shoppers about in other parts of Asia, including Hong Kong, was still significantly lower than usual.

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..In areas where seating is dense, protective screens will be erected to create a barrier between tables there will also be screens at the till.Staff will be given gloves, masks and goggles, although they will not be required to wear them. They will also be subject to daily health questionnaires and a health check using a digital thermometer. Workers will hold glasses at the base when they deliver drinks to tables.Where possible, each pub will have separate entrance and exit doors, with markings on the floor to guide any customers who become confused.Customers will also be asked to use the Wetherspoon app to order food to their table, or pay with contactless cards, although cash will be accepted.The JD Wetherspoon chief executive, John Hutson, said: “We have spent a number of weeks consulting with staff who work in our pubs, as well as area managers in order to draw up our plans.“We have received more than 2,500 suggestions from our staff. The safety of our staff and customers is paramount.”Martin has previously played down the risk of Covid-19 transmission in pubs but later changed his mind, saying the government’s decision to keep pubs shut was “fair enough”.The BBPA said larger pubs were likely to have an advantage in being able to show that physical distancing can be maintained.Wetherspoon’s pointed to the average 4,000 sq ft floor space of its venues and said almost 700 of its 867 UK pubs have a beer garden, roof terrace or patio."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6d0a29d659c17da35a55b13fdb1c75756509264/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=3ea7b5f466449fdd2293ea2ddf5c874b","title":"running out of things to talk about in lockdown youre not the only one","story":"We have been robbed of daily encounters with fascinating, delightful or irritating characters. How can we fill our conversations now?‘We haven’t got enough control rods, that’s the problem.” Mr Z was trying to explain why our conversations just fizz, repetitively, getting more and more aerated about the same subject. I think, in the future, I am going to ide the box sets into ones that we are allowed to use for analogies and ones that we aren’t.Sure, make a metaphor out of Normal People, no problem. Loads of things are a bit like Marianne’s earrings. Chernobyl is a hard no: we just don’t understand nuclear power well enough. But hear the man out: “If you don’t have the control rods in the water …” “You’re sure it was water? I thought it was uranium …” “Whatever, you can’t control the fusion …” “Fusion, or fission?” “If you don’t have CONTROL RODS.”Are the control rods other people? Or are they theatres, cinemas, spoken-word events and the whole cornucopia of the cultural world? They are basically everything interesting that happens externally, without which conversation pings off the walls, like a rat that has been given ecstasy for research purposes. Control rods are the couple you went out for a pizza with, where one ordered a vegetarian one and the other ordered chorizo, only when the pizzas arrived, the chorizo was more appetising and the veggie-orderer just swiped it, and you happily kill an hour trying to place that on the spectrum of good and evil.Or the guy with one leg, who has a brandy every night outside a Portuguese cafe, and always looks incredibly happy, as if life has treated him really well. He’s a control rod. A film that wasn’t as good as everyone else said it was – sure, you can talk about TV if you like, or books, but part of the interest was always at the meta-level, beyond the artefact itself. What were the people who went to it trying to say about themselves, and what did it mean that they reacted to it the way they did?A minuscule breach of etiquette on a bus, a homeless guy who asks your name and says his sister is also called Zoe, and then you ask his name, and it turns out to be the same as your dad’s (Mark). These are the control rods of relationship fusion (or fission).Friendships are suffering the same vacuum right now: I don’t think I have ever asked so many people, so often, how they feel about things. How are you feeling about lockdown? How are you feeling about your family? Are you worried about your parents? How are you feeling about your sourdough? How are you feeling about the job that you’ve been made redundant fromfurloughed fromrealised wasn’t a real job after having attempted to do it from home? How are you feeling about your unprecedented and entirely unnecessary levels of fitness? We never used to talk about feelings we used to talk about weird stuff that had happened.I have been reading so much complicated theorising about why Zoom is tiring. It’s some combination of tech (the refresh rate of the video feed leaves all the work for your brain to do to make sense of an often senseless image) and psyche (the dissonance between being with the person, and yet not with the person, heaps yet more unwanted work upon your poor noggin). I have something to add to this analysis: it’s exhausting, trying to do intimacy from a standing start. I don’t want to talk about how I feel, I want to bitch about other people. (I make an honourable exception for one friend: she tells me what she has bought online, and asks whether she should send it back. Currently, she has a wetsuit that is too small and two leftwing tea towels. I told her to keep all these items. And now, look, I am bitching about her, so we’re both happy.)Other people have found solace in the natural world. For me, this lacks the element of surprise. Ah, look a heron, in our garden, trying to eat fish out of the pond. Oh my a fox, also in the garden, trying to eat the rabbit. There are two cats fighting in a tree. When are you going to reverse my expectation, animals? Don’t get me started on plants.It is so perfect, I can hardly breathe nobody can win, so the argument will never end. It is as if they have discovered perpetual motion.

But the crisis has me reaching for the foods of my childhoodIf Wotsits still exist 30 years from now, I may eat one and be transported back to 2020. The moment that faux cheese umami hits my tongue, and I can feel my pupils dilate on reaching the gastronomic Shangri-La referred to by Guy Fieri as “flavour town”, I’ll fall down a rabbit hole of Zoom quizzes, hand sanitiser and unintelligible government briefings.It was never my plan to make Wotsits my own version of Proust’s madeleine. If I had any real choice over which food would send me hurtling down a winding path of involuntary memory, it would probably be something fancy and literary, like fresh New England clams, or the first bite of a ripe Comice pear. But Wotsits it is. And probably spaghetti hoops, Dairylea triangles, and Penguin bars, too. Because global crises, it transpires, put me into a culinary regression, the likes of which I’ve never known.Lockdown social media – as we all well know – is where you go to either check up on who’s winning the war on Covid-19, or to gaze upon people’s perfect, freshly baked sourdough loaves. Or homemade dumplings. Or, generally, photogenic meals containing at least four types of vegetable. Which is all very inspiring and motivational (if not overwhelming) for someone like me, who is always looking to improve and ersify her cooking skills. Especially when I’m increasingly opting for meals such as tinned spaghetti on toast. Because real comfort foods are the ones you remember.Tinned spaghetti on toast is something my grandma (who was a great cook, before old age and dementia) used to make me for lunch, when I’d go and stay with her as a kid. And it’s a carb-on-carb delight I can’t remember tasting since my 90s childhood. Triple carb, actually, if you count all the sugar in the tomato sauce. I remember the roughness of the piece of kitchen roll she’d tuck into my collar when serving me this a kitschy affectation, like something out of a 70s Italian restaurant. I remember the butter on the lightly charred white toast (it absolutely has to be white, for minimal nutritional value) melting into the neon orange sauce and creating something so much greater than the sum of its parts. This is an experience I’ve felt compelled to recreate in lockdown. And I can confirm that spaghetti on toast is still food of the gods. The scared, comfort-craving gods.School lunchbox foods have also been making a comeback. In particular, the criminally underrated Penguin, which is a classic of the “chocolate barbiscuit mashup” genre that 90s mums would buy seemingly by the pallet. Lifting that little flap on the wrapper of a Penguin bar to reveal a joke that looks like it was generated by AI is still enough to induce a Pavlovian salivation response.I’m not sure anyone would struggle to figure out why, in “difficult, strange, unprecedented” times, you’d reach for the stuff of your childhood. Especially – seeing as taste is such a potent memory stimulus – food. I can’t remember the last time, pre-Covid-19, I bought a pack of Penguins or a wheel of Dairylea triangles (another one of my grandma’s go-tos). It’s as if these (let’s face it) slightly shit British foods were designed to form a cloud of nostalgia around our brains that warmly pulsates every time we eat one of them.“If you like a lot of chocolate on your biscuit, join our Club,” I sing to myself in a low mutter as I wander around the kitchen, opening cupboard doors again and again, hoping for new snacks to materialise out of thin air. I’m not sure if 90s advertising was more powerful than that of any other era, but there is a distinct section of my brain dedicated to remembering its many jingles and taglines. All of which are channelled into the surrounding fog of nostalgia, creating – as I write this – a craving for Skips so intense that I may have to leave the house, thereby risking my life, just to get a packet, bring it home with me like spoils from a hunt, and let every one of those tangy, prawny little discs melt into oblivion on my tongue.After all, staying healthy while the world descends into chaos beyond anything most of us have ever seen seems needlessly punitive. Snack on, I say. And with every snack, may memories of simpler and nicer times wash over you like a warm, syrupy wave.And if anyone knows where I might be able to get my hands on a crate of Irn-Bru bars, please do not hesitate to get in touch.• Eleanor Margolis is a columnist for the i newspaper and Diva"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8f24176a62818ebc991f3ba39b506b4fbf2e646/0_138_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=045a88841eae668b3e60906042683698","title":"renewable energy may be switched off as demand plummets","story":"National Grid may ask suppliers to stop generating electricity due to record low consumptionHundreds of renewable energy projects may be asked to turn off this weekend to avoid overloading the grid as the UK’s electricity demand plummets to record lows.Britain’s demand for electricity is forecast to tumble to a fifth below normal levels due to the spring bank holiday and the shutdown of shops, bars and restaurants mandated by the coronavirus lockdown.National Grid is braced for electricity demand to fall to 15.6GW on Saturday afternoon – a level usually associated with the middle of the night – and continue to drop even lower in the early hours of Sunday morning.Meanwhile, the sunny weather is expected to generate more renewable electricity than the UK needs. “Bank holidays see reduced demand for electricity, and even more so with the current lockdown measures in place,” said Amy Weltevreden, a manager at the energy system operator.The National Grid control room plans to use a new scheme this weekend that will pay small wind turbines and solar installations to stop generating electricity if the UK’s renewable energy sources threaten to overwhelm the energy system.About 170 small-scale renewable energy generators have signed up to the scheme, with a total capacity of 2.4GW. This includes 1.5GW of wind power and 700MW of solar energy. Other companies have also signed up to boost their electricity use when demand falls too low.“If we’re anticipating the wind blowing at a given time when we’re also expecting low demand, we’re now able to instruct these smaller-scale distributed generators to reduce output to help balance the system,” Weltevreden said. “Much of the renewable electricity generated in Great Britain comes from these smaller units – what we call distributed or embedded generation. Because they’re not connected directly to our transmission system, in the past we haven’t had as much ability to control the power they’re producing to balance the grid.”National Grid warned last month that the low demand for electricity could mean that renewable energy is turned off to avoid overloading the grid with more electricity than the UK can use.Roisin Quinn, head of National Grid’s control room, said: “The assumption will be that lower demand makes it easier for us to do our job, with less power needed overall and therefore less stress on the system. In fact, as system operator, it’s just as important for us to manage lower demand for electricity as it is to manage the peaks.”Electricity demand fell to record lows of 15.2GW over the Easter weekend, well below National Grid’s forecast lows of 17.6GW for this summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59550c16f3e4730e74ee666d3c32a02b34a253c/0_254_3804_2282/master/3804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f5fa9989aaa389d1627716fd91feddd","title":"young climate activists call for eu to radically reform farming sector","story":"Fridays for Future to publish letter urging reform of common agricultural policy ahead of European commission meeting The EU’s farming sector needs radical reform, and the common agricultural policy (CAP) must be rewritten if the climate crisis is to be tackled, a group of young climate activists will urge.Fridays for Future, founded by teenagers in the wake of Greta Thunberg’s school strikes, will confront the European commission’s vice-president, Frans Timmermans, online to call for new plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, and replace subsidies based on the amount of land farmed with payments for farmers supplying public goods, such as clean water, clean air and lower carbon emissions.The CAP is worth close to €60bn a year, and costs roughly €114 annually per citizen. However, the system has been blamed for the increase in intensive farming, overuse of pesticides and poor attention to soil conservation and wildlife protection.Earlier this week, the EU published its bioersity strategy, which would devote €20bn a year to boosting wildlife, and require the planting of 3bn trees in the next decade, but stopped short of the sweeping reform of the CAP that campaigners want.Reform to subsidies could reward farmers for conserving carbon in their soil and vegetation, which would benefit nature as well as helping the EU to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The EU’s farm to fork strategy would cut pesticide use, boost organic farming and halve the use of antibiotics on farm animals by 2030, as well as improving farming practices to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.Fridays for Future wants the EU to go further as part of its European Green Deal, the centrepiece of the bloc’s strategy which is meant to steer Europe to net zero emissions by 2050. The European commission is trying to push the policy ahead of crunch climate talks, called Cop26, postponed to next year from their original date of this November in Glasgow.Ursula von der Leyen, president of the commission, hailed the green deal plan as Europe’s equivalent of the US putting a man on the moon in the last century, a transformative proposal that would reach into every aspect of people’s lives, from energy and transport to food and nature.But von Samson told the : “Everything that has been discussed yet is incompatible with the Paris Agreement, and the future into which the current CAP proposals will lead us are as far from one another as the man on the moon and his home planet. We want to remind the commission of their responsibility. If they want to make a real change, they have to start with a new CAP.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07f6a4e55587254ed4b3ec2f510310e394c9d0f8/0_285_1628_976/master/1628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1798206e15ebcc8589dc46d2b2f70875","title":"model behaviour naomi campbell at 50","story":"As the supermodel hits her milestone birthday, we look back at her life in the spotlight"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6730a49a419008421d7d5620d2cc60cdc386e2b/0_442_4286_2572/master/4286.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fc6730c6e225b47089764072c7c5eec","title":"ice cream with a twist delicious recipes with added cool","story":"Fancy more than a vanilla cone?

Tamal Ray is living his best ice-cream life with this dairy-free recipe (pictured above). Coconut milk gives you all the creaminess you would want from an ice-cream, while it has a mild-enough flavour to pair well with whatever flavours take your fancy – although malt and chocolate is hard to better.You’ll be hard-pressed to go back to the British summer stalwart Solero after trying Yotam Ottolenghi’s twist. Be careful not to whip the chilled cream mix too much: you’re looking for “very soft peaks”. As Ottolenghi says, you should still be able to spoon it easily into the moulds. If you happen to have any left over, pop the cream and fruit mixtures into a container, swirl with a spoon to give a ripple effect, then freeze to make ice-cream for another time.Two desserts are always better than one, and Liam Charles’s recipe will make you feel like a kid again. (A grownup one – there’s a splash of the hard stuff.) Raisins plumped up with dark rum and spices including cinnamon and nutmeg form part of the ice-cream (no machine required), which is then scooped and sandwiched between two cookies amped up with almonds and cherry. When assembling these crowd-pleasers, be sure to put each sandwich in the freezer as you go, to stop them melting too much.If you’ve got a bag of frozen berries lurking in the freezer, then you’ve got an instant ice-cream fix – we’re talking five minutes between you and a scoop. This recipe uses creme fraiche to give that necessary richness, but, says Jones, a full-fat yoghurt (or, if you’re vegan, oat creme fraiche) will work, too. You can easily double or triple the quantities, as long as your blender can take the pressure.A new-wave rocky road in the form of an ice-cream cake. There’s an impressive two cookie base, and a secret layer of peanuts, chocolate chips and mini marshmallows topped with an easy cocoa ice-cream. However, the real joy comes in the decorating. Spoon over a layer of caramel, then get creative with more peanuts, marshmallows or chocolate buttons. Here, more is more. We take no responsibility for any sugar rush caused.In India, Meera Sodha says, the name for avocado is “butter fruit”, which makes it the perfect base for a vegan ice-cream. You will need to start this avo ice-cream the day before you want to demolish it, and you’ll also need an ice-cream maker. Sodha adds that “the bowl of the ice-cream machine needs to be well-frozen”, so pop it in for a minimum of half a day before you start churning. Top with a few raspberries and, if you fancy, a shake or two of matcha powder.Follow Rachel Roddy’s eminently sensible serving advice for this five-minute lemon sorbet, prosecco and vodka cocktail: “I prefer sgroppino after a meal a pudding crossed with another drink. Alternatively, I like one or two in the middle of a hot afternoon, for internal cooling and to aid full concentration.” It’s worth noting that this cocktail is a tale of three temperatures: the sorbet must be soft enough to scoop, the prosecco cold and the vodka straight from the freezer.Georgina Hayden’s sweet, tart pomegranate ice is going to take control of your sorbet-related plans this summer. You don’t want the rose water to overpower, so start by stirring three tablespoons into the fruit juice mix, leave to cool completely, then taste and add a further tablespoon if needed. Serve with shards of sesame brittle, more pomegranate seeds and some rose petals, if you fancy – Baz Luhrmann-style bowl optional, but very much encouraged.The window for elderflowers is so short, you really should make the most of them while you can. Step forward Jeremy Lee’s two-for-the-price-of-one recipe. First, make an elderflower cordial then, with the addition of some lemon juice, water, and a spoonful or two of sugar, make a wonderful sorbet. Buttery pistachio biscuits, Lee says, would sit merrily alongside. “These are best done by hand, but of course they can be done in a machine, keeping a very beady eye that the dough is not overmixed,” he says. Who are we to argue?Making ice-cream can be a faff, with the egg custard, locating the ice-cream maker (if you’re even in possession of such a thing) and making endless trips to the freezer to contend with. While a no-churn ice-cream is a slight compromise on taste (churning whips air into the mixture, which gives a certain lightness), if you do it right, says Felicity Cloake, the results are worth the minimal hassle. Plus, once you’ve mastered this method, you can start experimenting with other flavours.Nigel Slater’s recipe requires a bit of patience, but the result is the perfect foil to a hot day – “a shimmering pile of ice crystals”. You don’t want the watermelon granita to freeze into one large ice cube, so you’ll need to gently mix regularly – every hour for about four hours. Topped with a brilliant green herb sugar, you’ll be as cool as Harry Styles’s nails in the video for his aptly named track Watermelon Sugar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43316e26654abc44194806a6d1f19f176107cbf8/0_142_2120_1272/master/2120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c1cfbba36bb69c3db46f510e089c3bc","title":"wine supermarket special offers dont always mean savings fiona beckett","story":"Deals and wine boxes don’t always deliver the savings you’d expect – so it pays to shop aroundIf you’re someone who’s been supporting local food producers or takeaways from your favourite restaurant, you might want to buy at least some of your wine from indies, too, especially suppliers and importers who service the currently non-existent restaurant trade. Many pubs and restaurants are positively encouraging customers to use their suppliers to keep them going. Others, such as The Fox \u0026amp Hounds in Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, are selling wines direct themselves, alongside pasta sauces and pies.Granted, you won’t find much – if anything – for less than £6 at an indy, but if you’re prepared to spend between £7 and £10 a bottle, you’ll certainly get a more interesting wine than you would from a supermarket. And you can get it delivered to your door, rather than having to queue for an hour to get in, social distance down the wine aisles or lurk over your computer late at night in the hope of finding a delivery slot.Fresh, easy-drinking blend of sauvignon blanc, verdejo, tempranillo blanco, viura and three other grape varieties, which makes it more nuanced than straight sauvignon blanc. And which you wouldn’t expect for this price or this region.At the equivalent of £8.66 a bottle, this isn’t bargain basement, but it is good value for a generously rich, spicy red.

This is just one of the challenges for entrants into this year’s Football School Young Sportswriter of the Year competition. We are here to help, so follow these tips and you will be just fine.When it comes to finding a subject for entrants this year, think of what sport means to you and which sporting heroes are important to you. What is it about them that you admire? Is there someone whose performance has stayed with you long after the event, like Dina Asher-Smith clinching gold at the 2019 world championships? A game that you will always remember, like England’s dramatic win in the 2019 Cricket World Cup final? Or maybe an athlete who has used their platform as a force for good to help other people, like Megan Rapinoe or Harry Kane? It could be a professional athlete, a schoolfriend, or even yourself!If you are enthusiastic about your subject, then that will come across on the page. So choose a subject that you care about, and convey that passion in the language you use. How can you do this? Ask yourself if the article is exciting to read and think about the descriptive words you are using. If the action is unpredictable and dramatic, please tell us: if you want to keep on reading to the end, then we will too.The range of sports that were covered by last year’s entrants blew away our judges. They included Gaelic football, synchronised swimming, ski-jumping, equestrianism and darts. As we write this, the only football leagues playing are in Germany and South Korea that might limit (or maybe not) the options for football reports! The winning entries were about basketball and snowboarding. We can’t wait to read about more sports this year.This period without sport has allowed us time to appreciate what sport means when we do have it, and to remember all the positives that it brings: above all, sport allows us to connect with people. Whether that’s exercising with friends, watching a match with family, or experiencing an unpredictable victory (or defeat), it brings people together. We would love to hear how these moments of togetherness and belonging have inspired you.Football School is all about having fun and learning at the same time as enjoying yourself. The same is true for sport. We want you to enjoy this challenge as much as you would enjoy taking on a new sporting challenge.

Growing up in Croydon at the same time as Ian Wright and Mark Bright were inspiring the club whose stadium I could see from my bedroom window to reach the top flight for the first time in a decade, I probably should have done it was the obvious choice. But I didn’t.Instead I was seduced by the skills of John Barnes and Liverpool’s all-red strip and, as such, there was only one team I wanted to win when the two teams met at Villa Park in their 1990 FA Cup semi-final, which happened to take place the day after my ninth birthday.Following “my team” from 250 miles away at that stage involved watching videos detailing their unprecedented era of success before I was finally able to see them live at Selhurst Park in January of that year. Steve Coppell’s side had been thrashed 9-0 at Anfield a few months earlier as eight different goalscorers found a way past visiting keeper Perry Suckling – something I taunted my Palace-supporting friends about at school the next day.Seeing the team that would win the title by nine points in the flesh as they strolled to a 2-0 win in south London was enough to convince me I had made the correct choice. Even after Alan Pardew’s header for Palace in the semi-final on 8 April ended Liverpool’s hopes of winning the double, I remained staunchly in the red corner.Yet my faith would be severely tested the following season as Coppell’s exciting side, made up largely of players from the local area, recovered from losing the FA final against Manchester United to secure a remarkable third-placed finish in the league behind champions Arsenal and, yes, Liverpool. A 1-0 victory over Dalglish’s team at Selhurst Park in December 1990, courtesy of Bright’s winning goal, was particularly hard to stomach for one confused child in the family enclosure.Palace reached the final of another cup competition three months later, although its name will mean nothing to most supporters under the age of 38. Established in 1985, when English clubs were banned from European competition following the Heysel Stadium disaster, the Full Members’ Cup aimed to provide an extra competition for clubs in the top two isions. By 1991, English clubs were starting to be allowed back into Europe, but the Members’ Cup – by then sponsored and known as the Zenith Data Systems Cup after two seasons as the equally glamorous-sounding Simod Cup – was still going strong. All but five of the First Division clubs entered that season, with Everton seeing off Leeds over two legs in the Northern Area final and Palace beating Norwich to ensure they would represent the south at Wembley.The final was scheduled for 7 April – my 10th birthday – and my dad must have sensed an opportunity. Just like against United 11 months earlier, Palace supporters came armed with red and blue balloons that were released as the teams emerged from the tunnel.The game itself was largely forgettable in normal time and it has required a trip to YouTube to fully remember that Geoff Thomas put Palace ahead with a header, only for Robert Warzycha to equalise 120 seconds later. But I will always remember what happened next: Ian Wright’s goal in the 101st minute after he latched on to Nigel Martyn’s long punt and fired past Neville Southall. John Salako made it 3-1 in the second period of extra-time before a brilliant first-time finish from Wright rounded off a famous victory.“When Geoff goes up to collect the Zenith Cup, we were there, we were there,” sang the fans on their way home after Thomas had become the first captain in Palace’s history to pick up a senior trophy.After missing out on a Uefa Cup place despite their highest-ever league finish, Palace were relegated at the end of the Premier League’s inaugural season in 1992-93 as Coppell’s exciting side broke up following the sale of Wright to Arsenal. But my head had already been turned and things could never be the same after that day at Wembley."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/233ea17e84b0b7ebed41f0cf2a67d1396e0433c6/0_153_3580_2148/master/3580.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d07cdc5e7c6805822d2f6dde04de372d","title":"the joy of six footballs wing wizards","story":"From the ‘Wizard of Dribble’ to Ryan Giggs, via Garrincha and Jimmy Johnstone, we celebrate touchline-hugging wondersFormations in modern-day football, improved playing surfaces and the evolution of tactics have completely changed the role of the winger. Now it is more accurate to describe an attacking player who plays on one of the wings as a forward, because the modern-day “winger” rarely hogs the touchline and often plays inside-out. Players such as Johan Cruyff, Luis Figo, George Best and Cristiano Ronaldo all excelled as wingers but their talent was such that their positions evolved to the extent that they are rightly remembered as supreme all-round footballers, not just gifted wide men. Those celebrated in this list get to the essence of what a winger used to be, delighting in trickery, seeing their job as that of an entertainerprovider and never more at home than when within a few feet of a white touchline.“The Wizard of Dribble” set the benchmark for wide players when he emerged at Stoke in 1932. Wingers were mostly reactionary at the time, waiting to be rushed by defenders before knocking the ball past them to make good their escape. But in a reserve game against Manchester City Matthews revolutionised the role, racing at a rival before dropping his shoulder and veering away towards the byline without breaking stride. The modern attacking winger was born. Matthews was obsessed with honing his skills. He practised dribbling round chairs at home as a child. By his late teens he was making baffled defenders look like them. He added a second touch to his deceptive feint which is still taught by coaches today as the “Matthews Move”, a body swerve that does the same job as a step-over but requires only half the ego (not that Matthews didn’t have one). His signature move helped him create countless crossing opportunities as he fed Stoke’s leading goalscorer, Joe Mawson, in the promotion season of 1932-33.But it was more than 20 years later when Matthews had his finest moment on a pitch. As a 38-year-old he left 100,000 fans at Wembley agog after a masterclass in wing play, in which he made countless Bolton players swing and miss as he merrily skipped past them time and again on the right. Stan Mortensen scored a hat-trick for Blackpool in the 4-3 win yet the match is remembered as the “Matthews final”. His inidual brilliance was extraordinary for the time, with only Tom Finney coming close to matching his wing play in the 1940s and 50s. Matthews was a revolutionary in other ways too. He cut red meat from his diet to help prolong his career. It worked. He won the inaugural Ballon d’Or at 41, became the oldest ever England international at 42, won the Football Writers’ Association’s Footballer of the Year award for guiding Stoke back into the First Division at 48 and played in the top flight until he was 50.Scotland has a history of producing artful wingers almost as rich as its whiskies. Alan Morton, one of Scotland’s Wembley Wizards, was a tiny touchline-hugging wonder whose dazzling displays for Rangers at outside-left helped the club win eight league titles in the 1920s, while Willie Waddell was a more dashing, direct wide man who dominated the right flank at Ibrox in the 1940s and 50s. But no discussion about wing wizardry would be complete without a tip of the hat to “Jinky” Jimmy Johnstone, who won nine league titles and Celtic’s only European Cup between 1962 and 1975.His height of 5ft 4in could have been a huge disadvantage on the pock-marked battlefields of Scottish football but it was perhaps his greatest weapon. His low centre of gravity meant he could throw an overgrown centre-back off his scent with just a wiggle of his hips, while his feather-toed touch and acceleration were frightening for the time. In British football in the 60s only George Best had the balance and poise of Johnstone while dribbling. And while Best was more of a visionary playmaker who could shift positions, Johnstone delighted in teasing defenders as he skipped up the right touchline, hurdling and – yes – jinking, his way past them. “You’ve got to entertain and to do that you’ve got to practise at it,” said Johnstone after his retirement. That dedication to ball control helped make him a Lisbon Lion in 1967, a year when he was also voted the world’s third best player.John Robertson was a very unattractive young man. If one day, I felt a bit off colour, I would sit next to him. I was bloody Errol Flynn in comparison. But give him a ball and a yard of grass, and he was an artist, the Picasso of our game.The left-winger was Brian Clough’s favourite footballer but he barely looked like one until Ol’ Big Head turned up at Nottingham Forest in 1975. He was in and out of the team in his early years there until Clough encouraged him to stay wide and get forward more. “Robbo, come and stand by me,” Clough would instruct him from the sidelines. Out wide he could use tight space like no one else. He was a master of the waiting game, teasing defenders by appearing to be gassed before dangling the carrot, waiting for the bite and racing away with pace that defied his appearance. Perhaps his greatest strength was the fact that full-backs could not show Robertson on to his weak foot, because he didn’t have one. He was as effective at coming inside his marker as he was at going outside. He twisted defenders’ blood long before Fergie gave a name to such attacking torment and his crossing was sublime – no better than when he beat two Malmö defenders with a soft-shoed shuffle up the line before curling an inswinging gift on to the head of Trevor Francis for the winner in the 1979 European Cup final. Scoring in the 1980 final was not a bad feat, either.Great midfielders need to be able to see the bigger picture, how a move might develop, where space might open up or when the pace of the game might need to shift. For the great wingers of the past, none of this was true. Garrincha was pure spontaneity, playing like an angry wasp who would sting a defender once, then come back to do it again before buzzing away with the ball to hurt his next victim. He was the greatest dribbler of his generation, which is not bad for a kid born with a crooked spine and bent legs who many thought would never be able to play professional football. When Garrincha and Pelé played together, Brazil never lost. He was inspirational in both Brazil’s 1958 and 1962 World Cup victories. One of his nicknames was the People’s Joy. Little wonder. Brazilians will tell you that the first olés heard at a ground came as Garrincha played the matador to the angry bulls he left snorting behind him as he went on his stop-start dribbles up the touchline. He was pure jazz and would be uncoachable today. Pelé may be Brazil’s greatest player but Garrincha’s sparkling wing play gave the world joga bonito.British football in the early 1980s was not the easiest place for a winger to thrive. The long-ball game was the preferred route for many teams and skilful, expressive players were finding it hard to make an impact. So when John Barnes burst on to the left-wing scene at Watford he was a breath of fresh air. The slight, tricksy wingers of the 1970s were dying out, with powerful speed merchants replacing them. Barnes possessed the ability to be both of these at once. He was as adept at beating a man with a delicious bit of skill or a pirouette as he was at bursting to the line and delivering a perfect cross. His dribbling high-water mark came in an England shirt in 1984 when he beat Brazil at their own game at the Maracanã.Peter Shilton might not still be talking about the Hand of God had Barnes started the 1986 World Cup quarter-final, either. In just 16 minutes he almost turned the game, creating a goal for Gary Lineker and causing turmoil in Argentina’s defence with his graceful runs up the left. He could have been devastating over 90 minutes. His deliveries were always carefully thought out, too. He never saw his job as being just that of swinging the ball into the box – he knew it had to find a teammate and it usually did – to devastating effect. When Liverpool peaked in 1987-88 Barnes was majestic, gliding past baffled defenders as though he had arrived from the future. And that gets to the essence of Barnes. Even 30 years later, he could still grace the left wing of any team.Manchester United’s history is studded with outstanding wingers: Billy Meredith, Steve Coppell, Jesper Olsen, Willie Morgan and Andrei Kanchelskis – not to mention Cristiano Ronaldo, David Beckham and Best, who became more than just wide players as their careers progressed. The same could be said of Ryan Giggs. He often played centrally in his latter years but how do you remember him? Of course, it is of that electrifying early-career Giggs haring up the left wing “like a cocker iel chasing a piece of silver paper in the wind”, as Alex Ferguson so brilliantly described him.He was never the most graceful dribbler but so what? He was devastating. His control while running at searing pace was sensational. When he was in full flow his slender frame meant he often looked like he was being blown off course, though a couple of rapid changes of direction would make it clear he was fully in control. He left countless full-backs feeling nauseous as he twisted them into knots – and his inswinging crosses to almost a quarter of a century of Manchester United strikers created countless goals. When pundits talk of “Manchester United DNA” a counterattacking Giggs run and cross to create a goal is probably a pretty accurate image of it. He’s English football’s most decorated player, too. Quite right. His blistering wing play helped set the template for so much of Ferguson-era United’s extraordinary success."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27768e77710abb1d41f86049ba3b7b17da4bd1d2/0_387_5803_3482/master/5803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d146f99340197d637ed6bd0659b3821b","title":"planes spray the city at night covid 19 conspiracy theories in mexicos motor town","story":"In San Luis Potosí, cases of Covid-19 are rising, but not everyone is taking lockdown seriously. Photographer Mauricio Palos looks at how the outbreak has affected his home townIn San Luis Potosí, a city in central Mexico, some people believe the coronavirus is an invention by the government. They are sharing memes, videos and recordings with misinformation, in which people tell you that in the hospitals they drain the fluid from your knees and planes spray the city with the virus at night.At the same time, it is very hard for people to stop working and self-isolate as they are being asked to do. In the brick-making factories in the working-class areas on the periphery of the city, workers don’t have the money to protect themselves. There is no antibacterial gel, there are no face masks and there is no safe distancing. The prevailing attitude is: “The virus will strike who it strikes.”Those who do believe in the existence of the virus, and how lethal it is, have responded by attacking healthcare workers instead of staying at home and protecting themselves.This is what happened to Sandra Alemán Arellano, a nurse who was attacked physically and verbally as she went to a convenience store wearing her uniform on the night of 3 April.Within two weeks, San Luis Potosí went from being one of the states with the lowest rates of infection, with 74 confirmed cases and eight deaths, to one with the fastest growing number of cases in Mexico, with 364 confirmed and 19 deaths, as of 13 May. This may not seem high compared to other regions passing through the peak of the pandemic, but here there is a sense that things are spiralling out of control.San Luis Potosí has been mentioned in reports as being one of the few states not to abide by the order to stay at home. Compared with other big cities in Mexico, the state is two weeks behind in the transmission phase of Covid-19. It is thought that the state will reach the peak of the virus at the end of May and that the curve of infections will start to go down at the end of June. The city is almost entirely reliant on industry. San Luis Potosí is a key link in the supply chains for companies such as General Motors and BMW. It has been part of the T-Mec free-trade agreement with the US and Canada since it originated in 1994 – because of its strategic connectivity between the Texas border and the centre of Mexico. Each car assembly line has brought hundreds of companies to the area.As elsewhere in the world, because of the pandemic, most of the industries have closed.The Mexican government’s recent announcement, after discussions with countries including the US, that production lines would reopen has brought optimism to the car industry – as well as to mining and construction. They have been declared essential industries and it is hoped that people will gradually return to work this week.However, the continued rise in Covid-19 cases could have a negative impact on the health of millions of workers and their families. These photographs are my way of understanding how the virus is changing our lives – how the light and shade of what we are facing in this pandemic define the identity of a city – and at the same of time making a record of the reality on a local level.The global declaration of the pandemic occurred when I was in the Colombian Amazon at the start of March.To get back home, I had to pass through four airports. As I travelled I felt totally alienated by the paranoia caused by the virus.When I got back, I was confronted with the inability of the majority of people in San Luis Potosí to stop their activities and stay at home, the lack of information and the disbelief of the population. They were waiting for the virus to disappear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42400f2e72f379d1f2c4dacdd918509d2ad20bb8/0_28_1887_1132/master/1887.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=583aa0b77ca910ff58f3024e3f4c8e5b","title":"where are the women afghanistan all male government meeting","story":"Tweet showed 12 male political leaders after Ghani promised women would be involved in high-level decision-makingPeople in Afghanistan protested on social media that no women were present at a high-level government meeting, despite assurances from the president that they would be involved in important decision-making roles.The outcry followed a tweeted photo of a meeting of 12 political leaders at the presidential palace – all of them men. President Ashraf Ghani’s spokesman, Sediq Sediqqi, who posted the image on Thursday, wrote that he thanked the men for their “efforts in the political agreement” they had achieved, calling it an important step towards national unity and political consensus. But both men and women voiced their concerns that none of the country’s many influential women had been present.Ali Adili, a researcher for the Afghanistan Analysts Network, tweeted: “Where are the women?”Freshta Karim, an activist and director at Charmaghz, a non-profit promoting education, said: “We are fighting a double fight with the Taliban, but also with our own government.She added: “This is how ugly they look when they exclude us.”More than 40 years of war, including years of Taliban rule, has led to women being stripped of basic rights, including education and freedom of movement. Many women are still made to stay at home and often do not have equal access to schooling.Some people dismissed the criticism on social media, saying there would be no point to include “any powerless woman”, and applauding the ethnic ersity of the men in the image.Earlier this year, Ghani said women’s participation was now seen at all levels in Afghanistan, yet recent meetings – including the signing of a political agreement between the president and his rival, Abdullah Abdullah, which ended months of political deadlock and will mean the formation of a new cabinet – were held in the absence of women leaders.“This is concerning, especially as the government is preparing for intra-Afghan negotiations with the Taliban,” said Shaharzad Akbar, chairperson of Afghanistan’s Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC).“There aren’t enough women in the negotiation team – numbers are lower than expected and there is a possibility that an almost fully male list of the cabinet is being put forward. This is concerning. It sends the message that the government’s leadership doesn’t take women’s voices, expertise and insights seriously.”After a landmark deal between the Taliban and the US was signed in February, paving the way for a US troop withdrawal and direct negotiations between the Afghan government and the militants, a 21-member delegation for the talks was put forward by the government – only five were women. The team was due to discuss potential political power-sharing with the militants and human and women’s rights protection.Sediq Sediqqi acknowledged the outcry over the photo on Twitter, and said the government would take note and assured women of their participation in the future.“Afghan women aren’t at the sidelines anymore, but they are leaders,” he said, adding that current meaningful participation of women at all levels of society had been unprecedented in the country’s history.“President Ghani’s main policy element on women empowerment for the past five years has not been symbolic, but a meaningful approach to elevate women and bring them to top state decision-making layers,” he said.But after Ghani’s first election win in 2015, only three women ministers were nominated for the cabinet, resulting in protests throughout the capital, Kabul."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8ca3018180a2d82e591fe958a4b60980e991d8c/0_40_739_443/master/739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05a4cc333f808b5215b038f7fbf84f25","title":"cracking the cryptic puzzled uk men become internet sensation with sudoku channel","story":"Lockdown turns mild-mannered mutterings from a Surrey loft into unlikely spectator sportWhen Simon Anthony quit his lucrative but miserable job at a London investment bank to solve sudoku puzzles on YouTube, it looked like a bit of a leap. His early posts had done well to gain 100 views. Perhaps he had overestimated the demand for long videos of a 46-year-old man putting numbers in a grid from his spare room in Surrey.A year later, Anthony is one half of an unlikely viral sensation: Cracking the Cryptic, the channel he runs with his old friend Mark Goodliffe, has become a lockdown fixture for millions. Much to the puzzlement of both men, they have turned sudoku into what right now might be the world’s most popular spectator sport.“It’s amazing when a video goes viral because it just goes everywhere,” Anthony says from his home in Reigate. The channel he launched three years ago has taken off in the past few weeks, attracting more than 200,000 rapt subscribers and almost 30m views. “It’s just very, very surreal,” he adds.Anthony’s latest hit is The Miracle Sudoku, a strangely compelling 25-minute video in which he takes on a seemingly impossible grid. In each video, a live view of the puzzle fills the left half of the screen, next to a webcam view of Anthony or Goodliffe, who commentate on their attempts to solve it.“You’ve got to be joking,” Anthony says as he considers a grid that contains only two given numbers. As well as the normal rules (each row, column and block of little squares must contain the numbers one to nine) this puzzle contains a series of constraints. Adjacent cells can’t contain consecutive digits, for example.At first Anthony thinks the compiler must be trolling him. Then slowly he begins to add numbers to the screen. When, 10 minutes in, he finds a place for all the ones and twos, Anthony dares to dream. “This is just staggering,” he says as the threes then fall into place, never departing from a soothing Home Counties monotone. “We are watching magic unfold here.”Soon it becomes clear that Anthony is going to solve the puzzle. “I’m not sure I’ve got the adjectives to describe what is going on here,” he says as numbers pour into the grid like rain on a desert. “It’s like the universe is singing to us.”Demand had already surged in lockdown. Anthony launched the channel in June 2017 but with its spare-room scenery, low-fi design and split-screen webcam format, it looks like it was made for this moment. Anthony suspects something else is happening. “We’re getting an awful lot of emails saying we’re helping people with their mental health,” he says. “There seems to be a sort of ASMR-type quality to the videos.”Before the “miracle” post, the big breakthrough came last month when Anthony put up another 25-minute video. It elicited phrases such as “good grief!” and “that’s quite startling, it really is”, but didn’t really stand out. Anthony has watched it race towards 4 million views. “It’s just bonkers,” he says, still baffled. “We focus all our time on solving puzzles but the YouTube algorithm is one that we have not cracked.”Tweets poured in from maths royalty. Simon Singh, the writer, Rachel Riley of Countdown fame and Bobby Seagull, the teacher and University Challenge star, are all fans. But fame has gone quickly mainstream – and global.“I’ve officially unlocked a new level of boredom... currently watching videos of a man solving sudoku puzzles,” James Charles, a 20-year-old millionaire American makeup artist with 19 million YouTube subscribers and 2bn views, tweeted last month. He had been binge watching the channel for days. “The videos are SO interesting but also help me relax!” he told his 5.5 million Twitter followers. “WTF IM LEGIT WATCHING HIM RN,” one replied.Anthony and Goodliffe, who is 53 and lives in Gloucestershire, have now increased output to two daily videos and receive dozens of submissions a day from sudoku constructors. They have launched three apps and a range of merchandise.Anthony, who has two young children, does not regret quitting his City job. “I only did it for one reason and was constantly aware I was working my youth away,” he says. He left with some savings and a notion that money from YouTube ads might then pay the bills. His income is still lower than it was – but it’s now climbing fast.Anthony met Goodliffe at a crossword championships 20 years ago, before the sudoku boom of 2005. Puzzling then was exclusively a pencil affair and newspapers were the only outlet. “Now there is a way to reach these vast audiences from a loft in Reigate. It’s…” For the second time this month, Anthony struggles to find the adjectives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a432781f99c7defc1f191192c2307b5e3dad7534/1094_697_5750_3450/master/5750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=078f0877581a977018225d3896c7b46f","title":"experience im stranded in a ghost town","story":"I found a VHS copy of The Shining left by a previous owner. I can’t bring myself to watch it I got a text from a friend at 2am one night in the summer of 2018. It said: “Wanna buy a ghost town?” I thought it was a weird joke, but I clicked on the link and started reading about Cerro Gordo. It was a piece of American history straight out of a wild west movie: an abandoned 19th-century silver-mining town about 200 miles from Los Angeles. At its height, it had about 4,000 residents, mostly miners who spent their time seeking their fortunes and drinking a lot. There was a history of gun fights at one point police were reporting a murder a week. There’s a rumour that Butch Cassidy hid out there for a while.When the mines closed in the 1930s, almost everyone left and the abandoned town changed hands several times. Now there was just a caretaker called Robert who has kept watch over the town for 21 years, protecting it from the occasional looting attempt, and the whole town was for sale.I grew up in Florida and consider myself a bit of an entrepreneur. I own a backpacker hostel in Austin, Texas, which was built in 1892. I’ve always liked that combination of hospitality and history. But I was 30 years old, the hostel was doing well and I was looking for a project that was more of a challenge. When I saw Cerro Gordo, I thought it would be incredible if people could stay there. So, I scraped together my life savings and convinced a few investors to get involved. On Friday 13 July 2018, we closed the deal.For the next year or so things went slowly we waited for permits and tried to make a start on the renovations. Everything takes an age, because it’s so hard to get people or materials here. When the coronavirus pandemic started, I got a call from Robert. His wife lives in Arizona and he wanted to be with her before lockdown began, so he asked if I could watch over the town to keep it safe from looters.I originally planned on staying a week or two. There are 22 buildings, including a church, hotel and general store I thought I could repair some and we could start renting them out to visitors. Mother Nature had other plans.A snowstorm hit the night I arrived. My truck didn’t even make it all the way it was stuck, spinning out in the snow 500 yards before town. I left it in the middle of the single-lane road and walked the rest of the way.It snowed almost every day for 10 days. It got to the point where I could barely open my front door. The road here is precarious. It rises 4,500ft over seven miles, so it was now completely impassable.And then, because of the pandemic, California issued a “shelter in place” order, so there were two reasons I couldn’t leave.The town has electricity, but no running water. All the food I brought with me is gone, but luckily Robert left a pretty large store of tins. I’ve eaten a lot of out-of-date beans.I have been here for more than a month now. I have a phone signal, but the internet isn’t powerful enough to stream Zoom or Netflix. To pass the time, I’ve been playing museum curator, finding time capsules from the town’s history. A week ago, I found a briefcase, and inside were cheques from the 1920s, orce settlements and love letters: the highs and lows of one miner’s life.The thought of death is never far away part of the town’s atmosphere is its grim nature. The cemetery has about 1,300 graves there are bullet holes in the walls of The American, the local hotel built in 1870, and blood stains from an infamous disagreement in its card room. I found a huge VHS collection left by the previous owners, including a copy of The Shining. I can’t bring myself to watch it.If there is a silver lining, it is that the pandemic is forcing me to spend time here working on the buildings. I have taught myself to build a deck and to track animals most are rabbits, but a bobcat visits my porch every night leaving big paw prints.Once the snow has melted, I will stay here because I would like to give Robert more time with his family, and the news doesn’t make me want to go to a big city any time soon. Some days I can’t believe a place like this was available to buy. It’s a part of history, and I want it preserved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4382f922f2be1ee2f01a54f967b337378296aa19/0_161_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8457fb660cb15f1e6939384df35b806","title":"have you been living in lockdown with a brand new partner","story":"We would like to hear from people in new relationships on how they are coping living together during lockdownThe pandemic has changed all our relationships, but we would like to hear from people in new ones (specifically those who had been with their partner for a month or less before lockdown) about how they are coping living together in times of quarantine.

A barrister gives his viewOver the last few weeks  Money has highlighted many excuses made by the travel industry, particularly airlines, when refusing refunds for Covid-19-related cancellations. One reader even wrote in about a battle for a refund from a hotel on a Scottish island to which non-residents cannot now take ferries.There will doubtless be many cases taken on the consequences of the virus but the present law is quite simple. Once a contract becomes impossible to perform, due to the fault of neither party, it is treated as frustrated, meaning neither party is bound and any advance payments, including deposits, have to be refunded.Impossibility has a broad meaning but includes the situation where performance would become illegal. This was decreed in 1917, where the building of a reservoir was halted by government wartime regulations. Perhaps not surprisingly, the builders were not liable for their failure to complete.Travel being banned under the hastily passed Coronavirus Act, means the vast majority of UK holiday accommodation bookings cannot be performed legally even if the accommodation remains physically available. The non-availability of ferries or flights will make the situation even clearer in some cases.Airlines cannot in such circumstances be made to pay compensation under EU regulation 261 or otherwise – but they cannot retain fares for flights that do not exist or insist on passengers rebooking. Some are making that the easiest option. EasyJet, although accepting its obligation to make refunds, requires passengers to phone its virtually unobtainable customer services department, while allowing those who want to rebook to do so very simply online.Frustration does not just depend on illegality. With events being cancelled some months into the future, including August’s Edinburgh festival, hoteliers may hope that travel to the venue will no longer be against the law then and refuse cancellations. However, cases arising out of the postponement of Edward VII’s coronation in 1902 may oblige them to refund deposits. A Mr Henry who had booked rooms to watch it was entitled to his money back, although it would have been possible for him to occupy the rooms anyway. So long as the parties know what the purpose of the stay is, the cancellation of the event makes the contract impossible to perform as envisaged, as is likely to be the case where hotels market themselves and raise prices for a specific event.Where the accommodation is abroad, like that of one reader who had been refused a refund even after a Spanish hotel closed completely, the contract may be subject to a foreign law. However, EU-wide consumer protection laws would mean a refund was due. In the US, where citing Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code may be helpful and in most English-speaking countries the same basic law of frustration applies.Some contracts contain clauses that specify what will happen in the event of force majeure. This is not defined in English law but according to the Dutch airline KLM’s conditions means “extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances that are beyond the control of the party invoking it and which could not have been avoided despite all the care and attention exercised”. UK airlines do not generally include such a condition.Would-be passengers may feel it an act of corporate cynicism to prioritise the payment of £60m to Haji-Ioannou, who has not been required to call a constantly engaged number to get his money, over the equally binding obligation to refund who may really need the cash."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4734cde7e7424113d4a2a3efa010aebfa08913b2/420_436_3068_1841/master/3068.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=611de87b4fd5a1e863271507533659c2","title":"uk mortgage payment holiday extended by three months covid 19","story":"Treasury also extends ban on home repossessions to 31 October amid Covid-19 crisisThe government has extended its mortgage payment holiday scheme by three months and the ban on home repossessions until the end of October.More than 1.8 million homeowners have taken a three-month mortgage holiday since the scheme was announced in March to help borrowers in financial difficulty because of the coronavirus crisis, according to Treasury figures. It was due to expire at the end of June.“We’re doing everything we can to help people with their finances at this difficult time and that includes making sure people get the support they need with their mortgages,” said John Glen, the economic secretary to the Treasury. “That’s why we’re working with the banks and lenders to extend payment holidays if people need them.”The government said that while homeowners who had taken a mortgage holiday should restart marking payments if they could, it was extending the scheme to help those still struggling with the impact of the coronavirus.“Everyone’s circumstances will be different, so when homeowners can pay some or all of their mortgage, they should work with their lender on a plan,” Glen said. “But if they are still struggling, I want them to know that help is there.”The Financial Conduct Authority has published draft guidelines for lenders to follow that set out options to be offered to borrowers. These include resuming full monthly payments, making reduced payments, temporarily switching to an interest-only mortgage or extending their mortgage payment holiday.“Our expectations are clear: anyone who continues to need help should get help from their lender,” said Christopher Woolard, the interim chief executive at the FCA. “Where consumers can afford to restart mortgage payments it is in their best interests to do so. We expect firms to work with customers on the best options available for them, paying particular attention to the needs of their vulnerable customers.”Lenders will also be expected to extend the application period for a mortgage holiday until 31 October, so customers who have not yet had a payment holiday and are experiencing financial difficulty will be able to request one for a period of three months.The Treasury also announced on Friday that it was extending its ban on home repossessions to 31 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd2ec7f87d267d28756c13d261da214ed4c4917f/91_273_3427_2058/master/3427.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b5e26631d29bb1a16738897e4f8b7a8","title":"classical music opera livestream at home coronavirus","story":"With concert halls and opera houses closed, organisations and musicians across the world are livestreaming concerts from their homes, or from empty halls, and opening up their digital archives so that every one can still access music.•This week’s daily critics’ picks • The annual English music festival will take place online this year with performances and talks (some pre-recorded) available over the festival weekend, 22 – 25 May 2020.

I just released my album, and so I would have been forced to be introspective regardless, because after you release a body of work and it starts getting critiqued by the general public, that creates a whole lot of dysphoria about yourself. But isolation has further forced me to process it: what have I just created? I’ve also been able to practice and flex my cooking – I’ve been making a lot of stews I roasted a big old snapper for the first time last week. It’s a lot of African and Caribbean dishes and styles: a lot of yuca.One of the songs I’ve been listening to on repeat all year, but especially now, is Pi, off Kate Bush’s Aerial album. It’s this dance back and forth between a 68 post-bop almost-swing groove, and then the typical Kate Bush sound that we know: medieval pop in the 80s. She’s singing about this guy who’s obsessed with numbers, and as someone who has been diagnosed with non-neurotypical things like ADHD and depression, something about the way she’s speaking, the franticness and the rushed sense in the lyrics, really remind me of when I’m in a moment of mania or mental hyperactivity. It sounds like what it feels like when my brain is just going.A lot of music I’ve been listening to is impressionist music, being able to capture things through sonics and not necessarily lyrics – I’ve been enthralling myself with composers and arrangers who are able to do that. This is a sonic commentary on police brutality, black children that are being murdered and hate crimes in general. The alliteration alone, to describe human life in that way, I thought was incredibly poignant. It’s 13 minutes of pain and beauty and sorrow, but also hope. The hope for black people in America lies where it always has, in the art and the work we make, and the conversations that we have, and the spirit that we embody every day.It’s been beautiful to see Angel Bat Dawid, an artist out of Chicago, getting her reverence, because she’s an incredible artist and composer, and so is the whole post-AACM jazz community there. This resonates with me because it reminds me of my childhood in Chicago, and a sound that is so specific to the avant-garde jazz scene there. Jazz instrumentation, but with a lot of singing, and the sound of the bass clarinet and tuba: sounds that you don’t necessarily hear in more modern jazz. Not a lot of intense, lush, chordal big band landscapes – it’s a little more broken down, more spiritual, more ritualistic. I’m in New York in isolation, and I need something that reminds me of my past – this music just sounds so much like home to me.The Wayne Shorter album Night Dreamer is a favourite of mine, and the waltzing title track is so beautiful. I’m up all the time at night – I play a lot of Animal Crossing – and so it’s a beautiful and relevant sonic allegory on playing in the darkness. At least that’s the way I interpret it.This rapper from New York named Maassai, a friend of mine and a creative collaborator, does a music series called Construction, which alludes to black Americans as the original construction workers of the country because of the institutions we literally built. She talks a lot about claiming and taking up space, and her identity as a black artist and a black woman, and so I really love her work. She doesn’t really sound like anything else – she is a lyrically dense and very skilled MC, first and foremost, but she raps over more experimental sounding music, and dance music. It’s definitely hip-hop, but modern and super forward. She’s incredible.Lockdown has also revealed some darker things that I’m grateful to have revealed to me because it gives me stuff to work on. One of those is understanding how lonely I feel each day – even though I have friends and community I didn’t realise that I write a lot about loneliness and habits of self-isolation. I think it stems probably from experiences when I was a child. I started understanding what it meant to be poor, and that there was a social hierarchy, when I started doing after-school music programmes and was confronted with kids of different classes and races – and that was when I started to understand loneliness. I believe you can carry all types of things generationally too – I think it’s something that’s in my blood. But to be able to see how many people all over the world are able to resonate with my lyrics, which I think are just my thoughts that I’m pulling out of my ass, it helps me to understand that if there is an inevitable loneliness to our human existence, there’s an inevitable togetherness too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f98fcdb99acfa2819abdc15f55476546eb73f434/0_32_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2f9030aef474c34fcece5cc7c37b117","title":"the 100 greatest uk no 1s no 11 the beach boys good vibrations","story":" It captured the mumbled inarticulacy and heightened feelings of love, but also the sound of a culture changingFew pop songs are as revered for their technical prowess as this post-Pet Sounds October 1966 release by the Beach Boys. With lyrics by Mike Love and writing and arrangement by Brian Wilson, who also produced, it was at the time the most expensive single ever made.The song’s provenance was Wilson’s longstanding preoccupation with cosmic vibrations – a concept apparently introduced to him by his mother. After several mis-starts, Love claims to have written the lyrics on his drive to the studio. He wondered how the band’s fanbase, wooed by early hits such as Surfin’ USA and Help Me, Rhonda, would greet this new avant-garde production. His masterstroke was the familiar tale of boy-meets-girl at the heart of Good Vibrations – one simply recast in the haze of the psychedelic and flower-power movements then emerging along America’s west coast, to tell of “colourful clothes” and a “blossom world”.Back when most pop singles were finished in a couple of days, Good Vibrations became an unwieldy creation. Between February and September that year, Wilson recorded numerous short musical pieces with his bandmates and a clutch of session musicians across four different studios in Hollywood, producing 90 hours of tape that could then be spliced together. It was an early example of an artist using the recording studio itself as an instrument. Wilson was building on the work he had begun on Pet Sounds, in which songs were crafted out of musical fragments he referred to as “feels”. “Each feel represented a mood or an emotion I’d felt,” he explained, “and I planned to fit them together like a mosaic.”That mosaic was a startling thing: comprising frequent shifts in key and texture, a erse range of influences including the work of Stephen Foster, the Crystals’ Da Doo Ron Ron and a chord progression known as “Andalusian cadence”. Alongside its polyphonous vocals it included cello played at a triplet beat, jaw harp, Hammond organ, bongos and electro-theremin. Wilson has spoken movingly about the sensation of finishing the track: “It was a feeling of power, it was a rush,” he said. “A feeling of exhilaration. Artistic beauty. It was everything.”Often referred to as a “pocket symphony” (a phrase allegedly coined by the band’s publicist), Good Vibrations’ structure is ided into six distinct sections, from verse to coda, via refrain and episodic digressions, over three minutes and 35 seconds – then deemed an epic length for a pop single. You can hear some of its legacy in the unlikely structure of songs such as the Beatles’ A Day in the Life, Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody and Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On.The song had its critics: many felt it lacked the emotional heft that had carried much of Pet Sounds. “It’s like Psycho is a great film but it’s an edit film,” the producer Phil Spector said. “Without edits, it’s not a film with edits, it’s a great film. But it’s not Rebecca … it’s not a beautiful story.” But others saw those edits as an emotional expression in themselves. Good Vibrations was at once the mumbled inarticulacy and heightened feelings of love, but also the sound of a culture changing – almost in real time. In this collision of sound and sentiment, Wilson and his bandmates succeeded in capturing the moment when everything we thought we knew about pop songs dissolved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/770e09b1d79643252d138820ec2642054fa10e3c/0_0_5535_3321/master/5535.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7877791a5ad66581296434470b423a1","title":"the scientific race to understand covid 19 podcast","story":"In the five months since the world learned about Covid-19, it has killed hundreds of thousands of people.

Anushka Asthana talks to Robin McKie, the Observer’s science editor, about what we know about this organism unknown to science five months ago – and how this knowledge can put an end to the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/661cfbf4a152ff654f93573b94ea6d01c4f61b94/0_0_5168_3448/master/5168.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ccfe96ecc606c30e737585b8e30dc193 1440w","title":"kit or miss in these bleak times i want to believe in the bunny that got away","story":"Happy endings in nature (one hopes) and retail, but no end yet to a friend’s testing farceJust when you think things can’t get much more surreal, we hear that Donald Trump has been dosing himself up with the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine in efforts to ward off the coronavirus that he doesn’t yet have. “I’m taking it for about a week and a half now and I’m still here, I’m still here,” he told reporters during a White House briefing. Given that hydroxychloroquine is not a vaccine, is completely unproven as a treatment for Covid-19 and can have dangerous side-effects, you can only wonder about the president’s state of mind. And that of his medical team who are happily prescribing him a drug that is far more likely to do him harm than good. Next he’ll be hooking himself up on a ventilator at night. I thought my hypochondria was bad – I’ve lost count of the number of times over the past 10 weeks when I’ve woken up with a slight headache or the merest hint of a sore throat and imagined I had the virus – but it’s never occurred to me to start dosing myself up with remdesivir. It would be like me marching into the doctor’s and demanding to be put on a course of chemotherapy on the off chance that I had cancer. Or having elective surgery to remove my appendix to ensure that I don’t get peritonitis.Two weeks back my daughter was tidying her garden in Minneapolis when she came across a small burrow of tiny, furless animals, with their eyes shut, that were clearly no more than a day or so old. She sent me a picture and we wondered if they might be moles, before someone pointed out they were above ground, had large ears and were obviously rabbits. Anna even got round to setting up a webcam so she could check up on them at all times, and we got used to watching the mother returning from time to time to feed them and scrape her fur to keep them warm. At a time when so much else in the world seemed so bleak, they came to represent something new and hopeful. A week or so ago, we got the call that we had been dreading. The webcam had picked up a neighbour’s cat entering the burrow. When Anna went out to check up on them, there was no sign of the bunnies. Then today, Anna was looking out of her kitchen window and spotted a small rabbit at the bottom of her garden. It was almost certainly from a different burrow, but I would like to believe it was one that had escaped the carnage and come back to let us know that just occasionally the natural world can provide a happy ending.Boris Johnson sold himself to many voters at the last election as the great communicator: the leader who could unite a ided country and get Brexit done. So it’s been a surprise to find just how invisible he’s been since recovering from the coronavirus. He’s given one confusing TV statement – with no questions allowed – and sent out junior cabinet ministers in his place at the Downing Street press conference. One explanation for his absenteeism over the last week has been that he was so wounded by his mauling from Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions that he had spent the last seven days preparing for this week’s encounter. If so, it only partially paid off: Boris was much more of his usual aggressive, unpleasant self, but the Labour leader still came out comfortably ahead on points. Not least because Boris insisted that all those overseas nationals who were working on low salaries in the NHS would have to pay a visa surcharge of £624 to access health services if they got ill while doing their jobs of trying to keep the rest of us alive. It was so obviously unjust and immoral that Boris was shamed into doing a massive U-turn the following day. There was no screeching reversal, however, on him forcing through a vote preventing MPs from accessing Commons proceedings remotely at a time when the official government policy is still for people to work from home if they possibly can. When recess ends in 10 days’ time, the only MPs able to join in the debate will be the 50 or so allowed in under the physical distancing guidelines. So MPs from constituencies remote from London will be in effect disenfranchised. Some would call it a scandal. Boris calls it taking back control.We need to talk about Kevin. Again. Last week I wrote about my friend Kevin’s experience of coronavirus testing as performance art. What neither of us had realised was that he was only in the first act of the play. Two weeks to the day after his initial test, for which he was never able to get the results, he was offered a second test. On Monday this week he went off to have that second test. The following day a result of “unclear” arrived back, so a further test was required. However, what was also unclear was whether the result was from the first or second test. Kevin rang the ironically named helpdesk which, as ever, had no information and put him on hold for several minutes. After a discussion with all of his colleagues, the adviser reported back that they had unanimously concluded that the result couldn’t have come from the second test as they had never known of an instance when the system had been that efficient. So on the basis of their absolute certainty of the incompetence of the system, they say he should ring back next Monday to find out if the series is to be extended to a third test. And the government wonders why the whole country doesn’t share its excitement when it announces a new testing programme.I’ve watched more of the Downing Street press briefings than I care to remember and will have to endure many more before the pandemic is over. Though sadly I will miss Priti Patel’s outing this evening as the home secretary is such a liability she is only allowed out in public when no sketch writers are writing for the following day. Already though, there are signs that the government is regretting its decision to give the country daily updates, not least because more often than not the minister taking the press conference – Boris has long since decided these are too much like hard work and can’t be bothered to turn up – has nothing new to announce. So on Thursday we were treated to Matt Hancock running through the same slides that have been used in every other briefing for the past two weeks, before being forced to admit that the “world-beating” test, track and trace app that he had insisted only a month or so ago would be a game-changer in easing lockdown restrictions wasn’t going to be ready in time. And, in any case, it wasn’t such a big deal as all that and had only ever been intended to be an adjunct to human track and trace. Most of us would just settle for solutions that were good enough to make a difference. Still, in these days of existential despair, just occasionally something remarkable does happen. I had been checking on the status of my exercise bike I had ordered from Amazon and had been informed that the one I had ordered was now indefinitely unavailable, so I had mentally prepared myself for the likelihood it would never appear. Then, out of the blue, I got an email saying it would arrive on 3 June. Even more remarkably, it turned up two weeks early and was comparatively simple to assemble. It has been the best £229 I have spent for a long time. Nearly an hour free from anxiety about the coronavirus and thoughts of missing my family and friends. What more could anyone want?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ded3ba24c3553415810b5a3b3c96caac9055f0db/0_164_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35bbae0aec9d3c6edefee60b94193e52","title":"children covid 19 adults data coronavirus","story":"Children are about half as likely as adults to become infected with coronavirus, according to scientists who reviewed data gathered by contact tracing and population screening studies around the world.“It’s preliminary evidence, but the weight of evidence is clear that children appear to be less susceptible to Sars-Cov-2,” said Russell Viner, a professor of adolescent health at UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and a senior author on the review.The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..“The balance of evidence is clearly that children are the safest group to be out in the community. They have the lowest prevalence of infections and the risk of death or severe infection from Covid-19 is exceptionally low in children,” he said.“So for children themselves, the balance of risk is strongly in favour of a return to school given the very clear evidence of harm due to lockdown.”Researchers assessed more than 6,000 recent papers on the pandemic, most of which – like the review itself - have not yet been peer reviewed or formally published in journals, and whittled them down to 18 that contained useful data on children’s susceptibility to the virus.Nine of the papers examined in further detail were contact tracing studies that followed infections from person to person. Eight reported virus and antibody test data and one was a review of studies on household clusters of infections.One of the studies found that in 31 household clusters of Covid-19, only three could be traced back to a child as the person who brought the infection into the home.Another report from Australia undertook contact tracing of all Covid-19 cases in schools in New South Wales over a six-week period from early March. It found that 18 index cases, comprising nine students and nine staff, gave rise to only two further cases among students and none among teachers, though children were being pulled from the schools at the time and awareness of the infection was high.While the UCL-led review suggests that children are more resilient to the infection, the pooled data were not sufficient to confirm whether children spread the infection more or less easily than adults.“In times of uncertainty, what we need to do is mitigate risks,” Viner said. “I would concur very strongly that an effective test and trace mechanism in place is very important to mitigate the uncertainty about transmission from children.”Rosalind Eggo, a co-author on the review and an infectious disease modeller in public health epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the evidence suggested children and young people were at lower risk of infection than adults and “may therefore play a smaller role in the epidemic as a whole”.She added: “This new evidence will help us better understand the possible effect of school reopening on transmission in schools and in the community.”In a draft consultation published on Friday, a group of senior scientists warned that 1 June was too soon for schools to reopen safely and that more time was needed to set up an effective track and trace system to contain future outbreaks.The Independent Sage committee, chaired by the former government chief scientist Sir David King, found the risk of children picking up the virus could be halved if they returned to school two weeks later than ministers were proposing. Delaying until September would reduce the risk still further, the report adds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea0748119492880663b2787ec8c35aa95af20337/0_0_4056_2433/master/4056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ccc933f3d8faabd789a99f0071c9688","title":"young people tell us how rising unemployment rates are affecting you","story":"As unemployment rates skyrocket in the UK, we’d like to hear from those under 25 who have lost jobs, or are struggling to get work, due to coronavirusYoung people, who often have less experience in employment and applications, are likely to be one of the most affected groups.We’d like to hear from those under 25 who have been made unemployed, or are struggling to get a job, due to coronavirus.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

Hotels could stay open, but leisure travel was discouraged. Following EU advice, non-essential travel into the Netherlands is banned until 15 June, but the country began a phased reopening on 11 May, when the death rate levelled and primary schools restarted part time.Although restaurants, cafes and bars can reopen from 1 June, with limits on numbers, regional authorities can interpret national legislation. But Halsema warned that, unlike Rotterdam, Amsterdam has a lot of canals and a large population. “We have a surprising shortage of public space, so I urge caution,” she said.A spokeswoman for the mayor confirmed to the  that although Halsema believes tourists are part of an international city, she is in discussions with business about how this takes form. “In a heavily-populated city with a lot of visitors, it is even harder to keep a 1.5m distance,” she said. “The worst thing that can happen to Amsterdam is to have another lockdown because the number of infections is increasing.”However, hoteliers such as Erik-Jan Ginjaar, general manager of Postillion Hotels, which has a 252-bed conference hotel in Amsterdam due to reopen shortly, said the words were “very dangerous”.“If tourists have to choose between Amsterdam and Berlin – which is sending out messages that it is open, you can visit museums and drink a nice glass of beer again – the tourists will choose Berlin,” Ginjaar said. “As long as the mayor is sending out these messages, it will be very problematic for Amsterdam to gain tourists again.”He said people booking conferences now for 2022 or 2023 should not discount the city. “We need to take care of the health of everybody who is visiting us and living in Amsterdam,” he said. “But it is possible, and safe, so let’s make sure all those jobs in hotels, restaurants, shops and taxis are protected by reopening the city slowly, carefully, but not at another speed than the rest of the Netherlands.”Meanwhile, other tourism experts, including Geerte Udo, director of amsterdam\u0026amppartners, have said the city only wants the “right” tourists in future, suggesting that it might have to look hard at what places, such as the red-light district, currently offer. Investigations are ongoing into dissuading cannabis tourism and changing the prostitution windows.Jos Vranken, managing director of NBTC Holland Marketing, is first encouraging local tourism. “We have a plan to start with the Dutch market, then flow out through Germany and Belgium, our neighbours, and the rest of the world, focusing on hidden pearls and unexplored destinations rather than hotspots,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92710f22237c0e8f9386410404d61fcb364ff4ef/276_0_2635_1582/master/2635.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1d6eb171a6fec28bb6f4fe22893f63a","title":"aka jane roe documentary norma mccorvey","story":"Filmed in the last year of her life, the film tells the story of Norma McCorvey, who was paid, she says, to convert to anti-abortion activism in 1995When, in 1969, a 21-year-old woman named Norma McCorvey met with two lawyers about getting an abortion in Texas, she was not interested in sweeping national change. She was pregnant for the third time and working as a housekeeper the stakes were personally huge, and time sensitive. She signed the affidavit for a lawsuit challenging the state’s abortion ban as “Jane Roe”, the anonymous plaintiff in the landmark supreme court case which, in 1973, secured abortion access for women in all 50 states.For years afterward, McCorvey went public as a hero for abortion rights, though she never actually received the procedure. So it was a shock when she dramatically “converted” to evangelical Christianity (and later Catholicism) in 1995, joining the ranks of the anti-abortion movement that has effectively gutted abortion access across the US in the decades since. For 25 years, McCorvey’s shift was framed as an archetype of redemption, the Christian right’s greatest evidence of the personal sin of abortion, a lethal narrative of regret.The admission, filmed in 2016 but revealed to media this week, generated shock and dismay, particularly for women who grew up with McCorvey’s flip lorded over by the anti-abortion movement. But in the context of the film, which establishes McCorvey’s history as an unreliable narrator, and the anti-abortion movement’s decades of smokescreens and lies in protecting its argument, it’s less a bombshell than an eye-widening confirmation. As AKA Jane Roe reveals, the real Jane Roe – survivor of neglect and abuse, working-class, an out lesbian for decades, a woman often craving validation – never fit tidily into either the sweeping, idealistic image of the reproductive rights movement nor the redemption archetype constructed by anti-abortionists.According to Sweeney, the headline-grabbing “deathbed confession” arose “organically” over the process of filming. “I absolutely did not expect it to go in the direction that it did,” he told the . “But I was shocked at the things that Norma admitted to and told me.” The film presents documents disclosing $456,911 in “benevolent gifts” from the anti-abortion movement to McCorvey over an unspecified time. Asked directly by Sweeney, the Rev Flip Benham, who targeted McCorvey for conversion in the mid-90s, opening an office next to her house, and touts their relationship in the film, denies paying McCorvey, but also adds: “Yeah, but she chose to be used. That’s called work. That’s what you’re paid to be doing!”The Rev Rob Schenck, who accompanied McCorvey in many of her appearances as a “born-again” evangelical but has since publicly reversed his stance on abortion, says McCorvey was “a target” by the movement, a “needy” person familiar easily exploited by clergy “used to the those personalities”, and that “at a few points, she was actually on the payroll, as it were”. McCorvey was at times “coached on what to say” in her public appearances, to make sure she stayed on message. “She was our Oscar,” he says, “and we were going to put her on the mantle and show her off to the world.”Which is perhaps why, when Sweeney first reached out to her in April 2016, McCorvey was “suspicious”. What congregation did he belong to? she asked. What anti-abortion group? “I think she was very grateful that I was somebody who was uninvolved in the debate,” he said. “And I think that was part of the reason why she agreed to meet up and why she was so honest and volunteered all of the things that she did.” At that point, McCorvey’s health was already in decline, and “I think she felt like she had nothing to gain and nothing to lose at this point in her life, and she wanted to set the record straight on her own terms”, said Sweeney.Using interviews filmed over 10 months and archival footage, AKA Jane Roe traces McCorvey’s life as a survivor of abuse hungry for recognition, prickly but vulnerable. Her alcoholic mother was not prepared to raise her, while her father walked out when she was young and barely returned. She remembers her early teenage years an all-girls state reform school, where she was placed at 10 after robbing a convenience store, fondly there was structure there, and friends, and burgeoning sexual relationships with her classmates. She got pregnant for the first time at 16, after meeting and marrying a man who propositioned her at the Sonic fast-food restaurant where she worked. When she signed the Jane Roe affidavit in 1969, she was snagged, as one pro-choice activist explains in the film, by a paradox of the abortion rights movement: with her rough edges, she wasn’t an ideal “poster girl” for abortion access, but that poster girl couldn’t have been the plaintiff in the first place.That paradox underscored McCorvey’s alienation from the reproductive rights movement once she went public in the 1980s (she did not match the cool glamour of Gloria Steinem, the broad appeal of Hollywood activists like Cybil Shepherd, the sanded-down Hollywood character played by Holly Hunter in the 1989 movie Roe vs Wade). The film also recaps her partnership with the lawyer Gloria Allred, who reacts with shock to McCorvey’s confession, to capture attention for abortion rights in the late 80s and early 90s.The “conversion” remains baffling, especially as Benham and his notorious organization Operation Rescue forced McCorvey to end her 25-plus-year relationship with her girlfriend, Connie Gonzalez. But the arc of McCorvey’s life as someone both scrapping to get by and eager to please is clear. “At different points in her life, people on all sides have wanted Norma McCorvey to fit their expectations or to suit their aims,” said Sweeney. “There’s a temptation to make somebody like Jane Roe into a trophy or an emblem and ignore the complexity of her life.”Whereas in old news clips, McCorvey appears tepid, on script for the intended audience, in AKA Jane Roe, she comes off as unburdened – conspiratorial, seditious, a foul-mouthed quoter of MacBeth. Even her “deathbed confession” is itself revealed with a half-ironic shrug. Sweeney fondly remembered her “gallows humor” that he got to know during filming. “That real Norma is a really funny, entertaining person,” he said.In the film, after her reveal, Sweeney asks: “It was all an act?” “Yeah,” she confirms. “I did it well, too. I am a good actress. Of course, I’m not acting now.” Taken at her word, her ultimate stance on abortion was characteristically, as she says, “looking out for Norma’s salvation and Norma’s ass”: “If a young woman wants to have an abortion, fine. That’s no skin off my ass,” she says. “You know, that’s why they call it ‘choice’. It’s your choice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/820b3b0902678a44ce0eb76a16e98b57bdca0bb6/0_0_4777_2866/master/4777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf0e042beb47a5ca17c87bb58ce53bd1","title":"we dont want to give up now could coronavirus weaken the podcast industry","story":"Podcasters have adapted during the pandemic, but between changing listener habits and new challenges, there are obstacles to overcomeFearne Cotton recently interviewed Ricky Gervais for her mental health-themed podcast, Happy Place. The conversation was going well enough, until Cotton mentioned that she was recording under her duvet. Gervais remarked it must be “very comfortable” to be in bed. “It’s not at all, actually,” Cotton replied. “But hey, weird times.”Happy Place isn’t the only podcast having to adapt to the era of physical distancing. The lockdown has given the booming podcast industry something of a jolt. Those who want to survive the pandemic (the alternative is dreaded “podfade”, the term for when podcasts peter out) are having to adjust at breakneck speed. Podcasters are recording in cars, in pillow forts, in cupboards, and stocks of microphones are faltering, even on giant stockists such as Amazon.Meanwhile, listeners’ habits have shifted. Before the lockdown, many of us got our podcast fix while we were travelling to work. Commutes have been all but wiped out, replaced for many with a quick stagger from bed to chair, and so spikes in morning listening have disappeared. The kinds of podcasts we crave has also changed: many listeners have lost their appetite for true crime, possibly because everything already feels so gloomy.Shows that derived their charm from hosts riffing off one another in a studio are having to rethink their formats. There are technological limitations, too. When podcasts first emerged in the mid-00s, they were recorded in the main by nerds using basic equipment. Now, many blockbusters series are being cobbled together in bedrooms, kitchens and attics, marking a return of sorts to podcasting’s earthy origins.It’s a necessary shift, but it does have its challenges. Andrew Hunter Murray, co-host of the QI-adjacent trivia show No Such Thing As a Fish, admits it is harder to be funny on a podcast recorded via Zoom. “Jokes take a fraction longer,” he laments. However, the team remain committed to making it work. “Because we’ve been doing it for six years, we do know how to pass the ball between us,” he says. “So we feel quite fortunate. And because we’ve never missed a week, we don’t want to give up now.”Shows about Covid-19 have unsurprisingly mushroomed in recent weeks. According to the podcast company Acast, it hosted more than 1,400 episodes about the virus between the end of January and the end of March. Some podcasts are specifically about the pandemic, such as the BBC’s Coronavirus Newscast. Others are existing science, health and politics shows that are focusing their energies on the current situation.But plenty of podcasts are deliberately steering away from coronavirus. “We’ve stayed pretty far from any major discussion of the virus,” says Hunter Murray. “We want to preserve the podcast as a space where you can go to listen to four dorks talk about stuff they’ve found out.”Stevie Martin, co-host of Nobody Panic, a “guidebook to being a fully functioning adult without screaming all the time”, tells me that recording her weekly advice podcast has been a way of coping with the stress of the pandemic. “I know people who have passed away from coronavirus,” she says. “The podcast has definitely helped keep me going.” Martin and her fellow presenter Tessa Coates have had to stop themselves from droning on about how ecstatic they are to be talking to one another after days of minimal socialising. They’ve also had to invest in better equipment, following a hairy episode in which Coates recorded herself in an echoey stairwell.The constraints of remote podcasting are forcing shows to find new ways of engaging with their listeners. Nobody Panic hosted its first virtual pub quiz last month. Other podcasts are braving new platforms, particularly Instagram, Twitch, Facebook and YouTube.For some shows, though, the pandemic has proved disastrous. I polled members of a popular podcasters’ support group on Facebook to find out how they were faring. One hundred and twenty-six respondents reported that their listening figures had fallen since the lockdown, 86 said they were more or less the same, while 81 claimed their podcast was being listened to more. Analysis by the podcast data company Podtrac suggests that after a dip in listeners during early weeks of the lockdown, figures are now stabilising.While companies such as Spotify and Acast insist that listener figures are growing, many shows are simply struggling to sustain interest and momentum. Parenting podcasts are trickier to schedule in, now that people’s kids are around all the time. And sports podcasts seem to be particularly suffering.Chris Miller co-hosts the niche but beloved Tottenham Hotspur show the Extra Inch. “Before the lockdown, the podcast was reliant on analysing Spurs matches,” he says. With football cancelled, the podcast has lost half its monthly downloads. Yet Miller and his co-hosts are still churning out episodes, discussing everything from players’ season performances to the club’s reaction to the pandemic. “Spurs tried to do the dirty on lower paid staff,” Miller explains. “We vehemently disagreed with that and it got quite political.”Meanwhile, lockdown seems to have nudged many aspiring podcasters into finally launching their own shows, not to everyone’s delight. A tweet by the Derry Girls actor Nicola Coughlan last month offered fair warning. “I know this time of self-isolation is hard and scary for people,” Coughlan wrote, “but however bad you are feeling, please, please don’t consider starting your own podcast.”But problems are massing on the horizon. Podcasts are something of a bellwether for the economy – when the going’s good, companies have more money to spend on adverts. With a possible depression looming, podcasts that depend on sponsorship could have a choppy time. Yet many podcasts have already turned to their own listeners for financial support, via platforms such as Patreon. If advertising crashes, it seems likely that more podcasts will explore subscription models to survive.For some, the pandemic has simply put plans on hold. The historian Greg Jenner has decided to pause the production of his BBC podcast, You’re Dead to Me, until they are able to return to a studio. “We’re really proud of it and didn’t want to make it if it wasn’t going to be as good,” he tells me. Now Jenner is making an educational podcast from home.Even so, there is room for optimism. The bond between shows and listeners seems to have strengthened. Podcasters may not be key workers, but they are making millions of us laugh and feel less lonely.Jake Cunningham hosts Ghibliotheque, a podcast on the films of Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli, and is also a heavy podcast listener. He has noticed how much he is relying on shows to cheer him up during the quarantine. “I’m seeking out more conversation-based shows than audio fiction or documentary stuff. I imagine it’s due to a lack of conversation in real life. I’m not necessarily listening to be listening any more, but listening to have the comfort of those surrounding voices.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

Writing on twitter, Cher said tears were rolling down her face at the decision. She thanked the Pakistani government and then simply tweeted “Pakistani”.The life of Kaavan has become one of turmoil. He arrived in Pakistan as a one-year-old, a gift to former dictator General Zia-ul-Haq from the Sri Lankan government, but began to be held in chains in 2002 when zookeepers were concerned about his increasingly violent tendencies.He began to show further distress after his mate Saheli, who arrived from Bangladesh in 1990, died in 2012. No other company was brought in for him, despite elephants being sociable animals who need companions, and he began to be known as Pakistan’s loneliest elephant, cutting a sorry figure in the zoo.Kaavan’s woes continued until recently. Last year his keepers were suspended for stealing his food and a few months ago it was discovered that wild boars had been breaking into his enclosure and stealing his bread and fruit. Kaavan was also found to be severely dehydrated.In 2016 his case was taken up by Cher, who sent a representative to the zoo to try to get him released from captivity, and a petition for his freedom had hundreds of thousand of signatures.The singer said she could barely believe Kaavan’s freedom was now secured. “It’s so emotional for us that I have to sit down,” tweeted Cher."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29e41d309e033ce097c147f518dd9b2ebf9b33f3/0_389_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1be1ef25e23ee156d13216ab8b202718","title":"coronavirus the week explained","story":"Hydroxychloroquine on trial ... approved antibody tests for NHS and care workers ... loss of smell taken seriouslyHydroxychloroquine: Trump causes alarm but global trial beginsDonald Trump caused medical jaws to drop around the world when he announced he was on a daily dose of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to protect himself against the coronavirus. Doctors queued up to warn that the drug is not approved for treatment or prevention of Covid-19 and can cause an irregular heartbeat – and even death. Mention was made of the US president’s weight as a potential additional risk. Even Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto expressed alarm, triggering a temporary falling out between the president and his favourite TV channel. “If you are in a risky population here and you are taking this as a preventive treatment to ward off the virus – or in a worst-case scenario, you are dealing with the virus and you are in this vulnerable population – it will kill you,” Cavuto said. “I cannot stress enough: this will kill you.”By Wednesday, Trump was saying he would finish his course of the drug in a day or two. Meanwhile, a major global trial began to find exactly the answer Trump needs – will hydroxychloroquine and the older version of the anti-malarial, chloroquine, actually protect people against Covid-19? Hospitals in Oxford and Bristol were among the sites recruiting NHS workers to take a daily pill. The study is being led by Prof Nicholas White, a world-renowned malaria expert, at the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok. If hydroxychloroquine does work as prevention or as treatment, the UK will have stocks, having put out a tender worth £35m for firms to supply 16m tablets as part of a contract for drugs to be trialled or used against Covid-19.Contact tracing plans in the UK seem to be up in the air, as it emerged that the NHS tracing app trialled on the Isle of Wight would not now be ready for general use until 1 June, not mid-May as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had said last week. The government says it has, however, recruited even more of the “shoe leather” contact tracers it said it would – 24,000 rather than 18,000 – although, of course, there will be no shoe leather involved as they will be calling people from home.A group of retired doctors and public health directors who have been running their own contact tracing operation in Sheffield for a month, however, say the new teams won’t find it easy. In their own pilot project, volunteers were unable to reach 39 of the 58 contacts of 13 positive Covid cases to persuade them to self-isolate, 29 of whom were care workers.Around the world, those countries that started test, track and isolation programmes early and stuck with them, such as Germany, South Korea, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Canada, have generally done best at keeping the pandemic death toll down.In the Science Weekly podcast Nicola Davis asks mathematician Kit Yates how useful global comparisons are when it comes to the coronavirus outbreak, given the huge differences in demographics and public health responses. And, as per a question from a listener, what is the best metric when doing such comparisons?

More vocal was US fury over the exclusion of Taiwan from the meeting – as usual – because of China’s opposition to its recognition as an independent state. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, was said to have “blasted” the World Health Organization for “keeping out scientific expertise”, although it falls to the 196 country delegates to vote Taiwan in or out.However, the director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, struck a determinedly optimistic note. “Let our shared humanity be the antidote to our shared threat,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92b590d5ee0ac264c56b35aa996db404564d1c3a/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84e22ed5c15196de24d4408432c8baea","title":"distancing advice in england could change to allow closer contact 2 metre","story":"Precautionary 2 metre guidance out of step with advice of other countries, which often recommend 1 metreBritain’s physical distancing advice to stay 2 metres from other people is a “precautionary approach” and could change to allow closer contact, top officials from Public Health England have said.The guidance is out of line with advice in most other countries and with recommendations from the World Health Organization, which says people should stay just one metre apart.“We have taken a precautionary approach to say 2 metres apart, full stop,” said Yvonne Doyle, medical director of PHE, in evidence to a hearing of the science and technology committee of MPs. “We are still learning about the virus.”But, she said, the safe distance is still, being discussed and evidence amassed as the end of lockdown restrictions approaches. Doyle said she was aware that a reduction to 1 metre or 1.5 metres could make the difference between businesses reopening or not.“It is an important decision. We are clearly aware of that. We are aware of the requirements of the economy and business. We are aware of the concerns and anxieties of the population. But the science should inform the measures as we go forward,” she said. PHE is contributing to discussions in Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) on the infectivity of the virus in different settings and its transmission on surfaces.Greg Clark, the chair of the committee, pointed out that the UK was going it alone by insisting on a 2 metre separation. “Other countries are recommending a shorter distance,” he said. The WHO, Hong Kong, Singapore, France and China all say 1m apart is enough. Australia, Germany and the Netherlands recommend 1.5m while South Korea opts for the equivalent of 1.4m.“In international comparisons, we are an outlier at an extreme end of the distancing that is recommended,” he told her.“We are aware of the international differences,” said Doyle. They would be looking at “whether 2m is actually necessary or could it be reduced further.”There is already evidence that people are less likely to get infected out of doors, which had fed into the decision to tell the public that they could take more outdoor exercise, she said.Catherine Noakes, professor of environmental engineering for buildings at the University of Leeds, told the committee that the virus dispersed quickly in the open air. “The chances of you being able to inhale enough in an outdoor environment is very, very small,” she said.There is very little evidence of outdoor transmission, she said. One study in China showed transmission between two people outside, but they were having a prolonged conversation, which suggested they were not far apart.People can sit closer if they are back to back or side by side, she said. “We believe at 1m to the side or back you really breathe the air in the room rather than the plume coming out of someone’s mouth,” she told the committee. Passing close by somebody in the street, she added, “the risks are very, very small”.Professor Andrew Curran, chief scientific adviser at the Health and Safety Executive, said the public needed to be involved in decisions about how they stay safe when they go back to work. Nobody should underestimate the ability of the British public to work things out for themselves, if they are given open and transparent information.“If you have to resort to PPE, you have essentially given up,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c498d650796cf93315bbbd155f1ec3d4e89d86/0_417_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f96b5b9240b6248b517886e38abffa23","title":"has the coronavirus pandemic made us all nicer community","story":"This week the Upside reflects on the revival of community, from mask weavers to valiant volunteersWhat doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.

As a disengaged student he captured my imagination with his passion for American lit texts and Shakespeare. He really brought them to life for me and completely challenged my (very limited at the time) world view that men could be sensitive, popular and educated at the same time. Sadly, I didn’t grow up in the most erse environment at the time! He was a breath of fresh air, never afraid to give an opinion or to challenge my personal mediocrity. He inspired me to go to university and be successful and engaging like him when all I wanted to do was coast through life as a 16 year old.  I’m an English teacher now and I’d like to think I rock a little bit of the party boy attitude and pedagogical style with my students as often as I can. I even find myself saying: “will ya bloody shoot oop!” From time to time in his Wigan accent. Thank you, Anthony.

I went on to do Latin American Studies at university where I learnt Portuguese, spent a year in Brazil and was bitten by the travel bug. In the intervening three decades, I’ve had the good fortune to live and work in many places – including for over 10 years in Bulgaria. There I met my Italian husband with whom I’m now locked down in northern Italy.I can still muddle through a conversation in Spanish – which this weekend I will with my Spanish brother-in-law – and think of Mrs Dronfield every time I do. Thanks to her rigour, learning Italian was less painful than it might have been.I would just like her to know that in the hills of Piedmont here’s an English woman speaking Italian and thinking of her brilliant Spanish teacher.Olga Wilkinson inspired me. There were times when she discarded the syllabus entirely and challenged us directly with moral problems from history. For instance, when I declared myself a pacifist, she asked me whether, if I found myself standing next to Adolf Hitler and happened to have a gun on me, I would kill him and thus save millions of lives. (I was flummoxed, but went on to study philosophy at university.)Gillian Fitzgerald fondly remembers an early champion of equality in Liverpool:We made xylophones in Mr Bleasdale’s class. It was the age of sewing for girls, woodwork for boys, but not with Mr Bleasdale. I sawed, sanded and varnished pieces of wood, ready for Mr Bleasdale to tune each one. He drilled holes in each end, ready for twine to be threaded through. At last, our xylophones were ready. I’ll never forget the thrill of playing a musical instrument I had made.Luke Bosman remembers language classes with Mike Clark:I was a shy lad who would naturally have preferred to sit unnoticed, to put my efforts into bookwork and to quietly succeed. Yet somehow he took this boy with a speech impediment (one of the reasons why I hated to speak) and helped me to grow in confidence, such that by the time I had finished my A-levels, for which he had also been one of my Russian teachers, I could speak confidently.When I qualified as a teacher, I had an interview at a school where, unbeknown to me, he was the head of department. One of the interview questions was, “What motivated you to become a teacher?” I was obliged to answer that my inspiration was sitting to the headteacher’s left. I didn’t get the job.Jerry Goddard goes back 50 years to a history class in Bedfordshire in the 1960s:Patrick ‘Harry’ Eavis treated every pupil as if you were three-five years older than you were.

Now 68, the Irish musician and activist says that he has lived his life refusing to look back. “I have the point of view that there’s no rear view mirror in this car,” he says.So it might seem surprising that he not only agreed to the BBC making a documentary, Citizens of Boomtown, about his first band, The Boomtown Rats, but has also spent the last year actively engaged in reliving his past through it.Over the years our opinions of Geldof have shifted constantly. From mouthy young punk star with opinions to spare to Saint Bob, the impassioned campaigner behind Live Aid, one of the biggest global fundraising initiatives of all time to a tragic figure, who lost his first wife, the TV presenter Paula Yates, and their second daughter, Peaches, to drug overdoses.The new documentary is an attempt not simply to remind us of those early days, but also to reposition the Rats as the ultimate in influential outsider bands, a group that came out of the grey repression of Holy Catholic Ireland in the 1970s with the belief that it could – and should – change the world.“We needed to change our lives and the only way to do that was to get the fuck out Ireland,” Geldof says, adding that it always infuriated him that the group were seen as “some kind of Johnny-come-latelies … when really we were Johnny-come-earlies”.“There was an assumption that we’d jumped on a bandwagon because there was no understanding that our songs were written against the background of the Ireland we came from, a culture that was enshrined in aspic where the authorities were desperately trying to hold on to power and there was no hope.”A new album, also called Citizens of Boomtown, the band’s first in 36 years, has been released, and had it not been for the coronavirus pandemicthe next few months would have been spent promoting it. “Although obviously that’s all up in the air now. We’ve rescheduled for October but I don’t know if it will happen.”The documentary, which is packed with tributes from famous fans from Bono to Sinead O’Connor, also includes scenes of Geldof and Yates, young, charismatic and obviously in love, which almost burn through the screen. They must surely have been hard to rewatch?“No, not at all,” he says. “I liked it because it was accurate as opposed to the tabloid view of us having had this sort of rancour-filled thing. We loved each other. We were together for 20 years. It was proper stuff, you know? So it was lovely to see her again and to remind people that she was very funny, very smart, very beautiful.” There’s a pause and then he adds softly: “She was just great.”The death of his daughter Peaches at the age of 25 in 2014 is harder to think about. “It’s impossible really,” he says. “When the deaths tumble on top of each other, my dad, my sister, that was tough anyway but when it’s one of your children that dies … the standard thing is that it’s as though nature has gone into reverse but, more than that, you know this is a part of you in a literal sense.”There’s a long pause. “I mean you don’t need me to emote on this, but if something that tough happens to you it’s impossible … it’s impossible to define the fug of grief you descend into or to try and articulate that grief. In Peaches’ case she … she made a noise and she made herself felt.” His voice breaks slightly. “She was far too funny, too wild really and maybe, maybe a little bit too clever for her own good.”It’s a description that could equally apply to her father, a man who was raised “without authority”, his mother dead and his father absent through work.“When that happens you learn independence and organisation very quickly, but the downside is there’s this dogmatism. There’s no one to temper your rapidly forming beliefs and no one to show you the boundaries of what’s permissible. You have to parent yourself and learn all these things. You have to invent your own universe.”He has no regrets about the way in which his subsequent fury drove him as a young man, even if becoming “Band Aid Bob” bought its own problems.“It was overwhelming. When a phenomenon occurs that enters the bloodstream of society then you do have a certain otherness. Everything changes. The only way to deal was to leverage it up by knocking on doors. So that’s what I did, eventually getting to Live 8 and the G8 summit in 2005.”That said he doesn’t think an event like Live Aid could work today. “It worked because of the position rock and roll had in society. It was a central part of the culture, but that’s not the case today. While there’s some great music and talent out there, music functions more as it did in the 1920s, 30s, 40s and 50s as a background to the way you’re living your life … people can make their own Live Aids in their bedrooms every day and put them online.”Yet for all the new technology, he’s unimpressed by the various online concerts intended to raise money and spirits during the pandemic. “They’re really hopeless. I don’t think they work at all. Plus I wish people would stop doing acoustic cover versions of rock and roll songs. Play them the way they were meant to be heard.”His own lockdown has been quiet. “I have the most mowed lawn and most washed car in the area … I have sort of loved the enforced indolence.” He does worry about whether normality will return though. “We’ve been very strict about social distancing and wearing masks, but yeah I don’t personally think people will feel safe about people trapped in a closed space with other people for a long while.”In the meantime he has one lockdown achievement he is proud of. “If I’m honest my biggest contribution in the last few months has been to grow a Kenny Rogers beard.”Citizens of Boomtown is on BBC Two at 9.20pm on Saturday"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e12eec643a2a8061788c8867b31468887de1b9b3/0_430_5045_3026/master/5045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ac8eedf946a82bbc0a26dca4f44181a","title":"reopening schools 1 june logistical nightmare teachers  coronavirus","story":"Teachers express concern about pupils returning while coronavirus still a threat in accounts sent to the  Teachers have warned that the UK government’s push to reopen primary schools in England on 1 June will be a logistical nightmare.Under the plans, schools have been told to prepare to resume reception, year 1 and year 6 classes, as well as any early years education they provide. But a growing number of councils have said they will not comply, and Welsh and Scottish schools will not reopen until later.In accounts submitted by hundreds of teachers to the  community team, there remains widespread concern about the feasibility of physical distancing in schools and the health risks that poses to pupils and staff, as well as how best to balance children’s educational needs with their welfare and wellbeing.Some teachers say they are reassured by the preparations made by their schools but complained that ministers have failed to provide detailed guidance. They want to review the evidence published on Friday by the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which warned that June 1 was too early to reopen safely.Sandra, 50, a supply teacher in Doncaster, says she welcomed her primary school’s plans to initially only allow one year back in early June, with others not returning unless it is deemed safe.She is concerned that headteachers have been left to devise their own plans without much input from government. “Some people are really anti teachers because of this and think the NHS has gone back and faced this and teachers don’t want to,” she says. “What doesn’t get taken into consideration is things like children can’t share equipment, crayons, can’t access books. It is a mammoth organisational task. If we were in normal class sizes that’d be horrifying.”Carole Powell, a teacher and manager at the Stoke Poges School in Buckinghamshire, says reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils will each be split into six groups of 10 who will have staggered starting, lunch and break times, come in at different entrances and wash their hands in the toilets before entering their classroom. They will also be confined to separate coned or taped off areas in the playground.Powell, 62, who is also the school’s counsellor, raised concern about the impact on the children’s mental health. “They can only play with the children in their group,” she says. “If they’re crying because it feels very strange, the teacher can’t comfort them. It would have been much better to have years five and six back first.”Jack Marsh, 33, a teacher in Brockley, south London, who has been teaching the children of key workers during lockdown, believes it is unfeasible to open schools more widely.“We only had three children in the last day I was in and we had to remind them 20-30 times about social distancing. They are taught in a hall where each child sits at a dining table with their own iPad and art materials. It’s going to be tricky to manage that on a larger scale.”Marsh is also concerned that the government has dismissed the need to take children’s temperatures on arriving at school. His father, who had lung cancer, died last month after having a high temperature, and Covid-19 was recorded as a possible cause of death. “The same government that didn’t allow me to spend time with his body are now saying we don’t need to take temperatures of pupils and staff.”Yazmin, a primary teacher in Brent, believes schools must only reopen when the scientific evidence shows it is safe. “With early years children you’re more exposed,” she says. “I turn my face and there’s a child sneezing or coughing on me, or needs comfort or help changing after a toilet accident.”The 38-year-old, who has an autoimmune disease, is shielding until the end of June. “I’m anxiously waiting to hear if I’m going back then,” she says. “Schools should only reopen once the infection rate is really low, and has been for a considerable amount of time.”Several teachers and support staff criticised the lack of detailed guidance for special needs education. Louise, 40, a teacher at a special school in south London, says: “We need to see that someone in government has cared enough to have thought this through.”She and her colleagues do not intend to physically distance from their pupils, many of whom have been in care and excluded from mainstream education due to their behavioural issues, including biting and spitting.Louise says it is often necessary to place a hand on a pupil’s shoulder or hug them to keep them or others safe. “It could be quite dangerous for the children emotionally if we suddenly withdraw all contact. Particularly because they’ve often had previous trauma, and we’d be adding to it. It’s a risk that we have to take.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/389c71fdd038ff42e5a2e338ffb98e40d31c3310/0_200_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8851e4b2edeaa73c1bddbf35fe93f3c","title":"uk covid 19 saliva test trialled 5000 key workers","story":" Alternative to nasal swab to be tested on police and army staff in next two weeks A potentially “game-changing” spit test for coronavirus is set to be trialled by the government on 5,000 police and army staff amid growing concern about the accuracy of invasive nasal swabs.The two-minute test requires someone to spit in a tube, and is thought to be as accurate, if not more so, than the throat and nose swab that detects if someone has Covid-19.Prof Paul Elliott, the Imperial College London scientist who is leading a major government programme on home testing, told the  saliva tests would be trialled on 5,000 key workers in the next fortnight.He said he was “very, very interested” in the potential of the tests because they are much easier to use. A swab must penetrate deep into the mucous membrane behind the nose and in the mouth, often triggering the gag reflex.The government trial will initially examine saliva antibody tests – which detect if someone has previously had Covid-19 – before being expanded to antigen tests showing current infections if it proves successful. has also learned that the government is in advanced discussions with one of the biggest saliva test companies in the US about getting approval for its product to be used in the UK.The California-based firm, Curative, which is run by an award-winning UK scientist, has told officials it can provide 100,000 tests a week immediately, with the potential for capacity to be massively expanded if it gets the go-ahead. The company is providing tests for the US air force and said it had carried out more than 300,000 tests in five states including Texas and California.Early studies in the US, including one by Yale University, have found the saliva test to be as or more accurate than the nasal swab test.Philip Beales, a professor at the University College London Institute of Child Health, who has been helping to coordinate the efforts of UK testing firms, described saliva tests as a “game-changer” and said they could “really could get us out of this epidemiological nightmare”.Beales said his team had found that saliva samples were “superior” to nasopharyngeal swabs for detecting Covid-19 because they remove almost all possibility of “operator failure”.The government has refused to publish its research into the false negative rate of the nasopharyngeal test, despite tens of thousands people a day carrying out the difficult procedure.A number of the government’s regional drive-through testing facilities, which are run by private contractors, require people to carry out the swab on themselves with the aid of a nine-page, 20-step instruction manual.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, told the Commons this week that the efficacy of self-administered tests was “not significantly different” from tests administered by specially trained NHS staff.The fallibility of the nasal swabs has led some GPs to advise patients to disregard negative results if they still have symptoms.Dr Richard Vautrey, the chair of the British Medical Association’s general practitioners committee, said he had seen patients with coronavirus symptoms but repeated negative tests.Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said false negatives “could be devastating if a patient was returned to a care home and passed the disease on”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7458863d8893748028afd9e88f0ab6af3c37e7b2/0_263_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2c902f47521f23b45ce09cbef69464a","title":"why we might not get a coronavirus vaccine","story":"Politicians have become more cautious about immunisation prospects. They are right to beIt would be hard to overstate the importance of developing a vaccine to Sars-CoV-2 – it’s seen as the fast track to a return to normal life. That’s why the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the UK was “throwing everything at it”.But while trials have been launched and manufacturing deals already signed – Oxford University is now recruiting 10,000 volunteers for the next phase of its research – ministers and their advisers have become noticeably more cautious in recent days.Earlier this week, England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said the words nobody wanted to hear: “We can’t be sure we will get a vaccine.”But he was right to be circumspect.Vaccines are simple in principle but complex in practice. The ideal vaccine protects against infection, prevents its spread, and does so safely. But none of this is easily achieved, as vaccine timelines show.More than 30 years after scientists isolated HIV, the virus that causes Aids, we have no vaccine. The dengue fever virus was identified in 1943, but the first vaccine was approved only last year, and even then amid concerns it made the infection worse in some people. The fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps. It took four years.Scientists have worked on coronavirus vaccines before, so are not starting from scratch. Two coronaviruses have caused lethal outbreaks before, namely Sars and Mers, and vaccine research went ahead for both. But none have been licensed, partly because Sars fizzled out and Mers is regional to the Middle East. The lessons learned will help scientists create a vaccine for Sars-CoV-2, but there is still an awful lot to learn about the virus.A chief concern is that coronaviruses do not tend to trigger long-lasting immunity. About a quarter of common colds are caused by human coronaviruses, but the immune response fades so rapidly that people can become reinfected the next year.Researchers at Oxford University recently analysed blood from recovered Covid-19 patients and found that levels of IgG antibodies – those responsible for longer-lasting immunity – rose steeply in the first month of infection but then began to fall again.Last week, scientists at Rockefeller University in New York found that most people who recovered from Covid-19 without going into hospital did not make many killer antibodies against the virus.“That’s what is particularly challenging,” says Stanley Perlman, a veteran coronavirus researcher at the University of Iowa. “If the natural infection doesn’t give you that much immunity except when it’s a severe infection, what will a vaccine do? It could be better, but we don’t know.” If a vaccine only protects for a year, the virus will be with us for some time.The genetic stability of the virus matters too. Some viruses, such as influenza, mutate so rapidly that vaccine developers have to release new formulations each year. The rapid evolution of HIV is a major reason we have no vaccine for the disease.So far, the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus seems fairly stable, but it is acquiring mutations, as all viruses do. Some genetic changes have been spotted in the virus’s protein “spikes” which are the basis of most vaccines. If the spike protein mutates too much, the antibodies produced by a vaccine will effectively be out of date and might not bind the virus effectively enough to prevent infection.Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who helped identify some of the virus’s mutations, called them “an early warning”.In the rush to develop a vaccine – there are now more than 100 in development – safety must remain a priority. Unlike experimental drugs for the severely ill, the vaccine will be given to potentially billions of generally healthy people.This means scientists will have to check extremely carefully for signs of dangerous side-effects. During the search for a Sars vaccine in 2004, scientists found that one candidate caused hepatitis in ferrets. Another serious concern is “antibody-induced enhancement” where the antibodies produced by a vaccine actually make future infections worse. The effect caused serious lung damage in animals given experimental vaccines for both Sars and Mers.John McCauley, director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute, says it takes time to understand the particular challenges each vaccine throws up. “You don’t know the difficulties, the specific difficulties, that every vaccine will give you,” he says. “And we haven’t got experience in handling this virus or the components of the virus.”When the prime minister, Boris Johnson, told a No 10 press briefing that a vaccine was “by no means guaranteed”, his chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, agreed, but added: “I’d be surprised if we didn’t end up with something.” Many scientists share that view.Those in development draw on at least eight different approaches, from weakened and inactivated viruses to technologies that smuggle genetic code into the recipient’s cells, which then churn out spike proteins for the immune system to make antibodies against.Ideally, a vaccine will generate persistent, high levels of antibodies to wipe out the virus and also “T” cells to destroy infected cells. But each vaccine is different and today no one knows what kind of immune response is good enough.“We don’t even know if a vaccine can produce an immune response which would protect against future infection,” says David Heymann, who led the response of the World Health Organization (WHO) to the Sars epidemic.Early results from two frontrunner vaccines suggest they might have some use.The US biotech firm Moderna reported antibody levels similar to those found in recovered patients in 25 people who received its vaccine.Another vaccine from Oxford University did not stop monkeys contracting the virus, but did appear to prevent pneumonia, a major cause of death in coronavirus patients.If humans react the same way, vaccinated people would still spread the virus, but be less likely to die from it.How well a vaccine works determines how it is used. Armed with a highly effective vaccine that protects for several years, countries could aim for herd immunity by protecting at least two-thirds of the population.Coronavirus patients pass the virus on to three others, on average, but if two or more are immune, the outbreak will fizzle out. That is the best-case scenario.More likely is we will end up with a vaccine, or a number of vaccines, that are only partially effective.Vaccines that contain weakened strains of virus can be dangerous for older people, but might be given to younger people with more robust immune systems to reduce the spread of infection.Meanwhile, older people might get vaccines that simple prevent infections progressing to life-threatening pneumonia. “If you don’t have the ability to induce immunity, you’ve got to develop a strategy for reducing serious outcomes of infection,” says McCauley.But partially effective vaccines have their own problems: a vaccine that doesn’t stop the virus replicating can encourage resistant strains to evolve, making the vaccine redundant.Hopes for eliminating the virus start with a vaccine but do not end there. “If and when we have a vaccine, what you get is not rainbows and unicorns,” says Larry Brilliant, CEO of Pandefense Advisory, who led the WHO’s smallpox eradication programme. “If we are forced to choose a vaccine that gives only one year of protection, then we are doomed to have Covid become endemic, an infection that is always with us.”The virus will still be tough to conquer with a vaccine that lasts for years.“It will be harder to get rid of Covid than smallpox,” says Brilliant. With smallpox it was at least clear who was infected, whereas people with coronavirus can spread it without knowing. A thornier problem is that as long as the infection rages in one country, all other nations are at risk.As David Salisbury, the former director of immunisation at the Department of Health, told a Chatham House webinar recently: “Unless we have a vaccine available in unbelievable quantities that could be administered extraordinarily quickly in all communities in the world we will have gaps in our defences that the virus can continue to circulate in.”Or as Brilliant puts it, the virus will “ping-pong back and forth in time and geography”.One proposal from Gavi, the vaccine alliance, is to boost the availability of vaccines around the world through an “advance market commitment”. And Brilliant believes some kind of global agreement must be hammered out now. “We should be demanding, now, a global conference on what we’re going to do when we get a vaccine, or if we don’t,” he says.“If the process of getting a vaccine, testing it, proving it, manufacturing it, planning for its delivery, and building a vaccine programme all over the world, if that’s going to take as long as we think, then let’s fucking start planning it now.”People will have to adapt – and life will change. Heymann says we will have to get used to extensive monitoring for infections backed up by swift outbreak containment. People must play their part too, by maintaining handwashing, physical distancing and avoiding gatherings, particularly in enclosed spaces. Repurposed drugs are faster to test than vaccines, so we may have an antiviral or an antibody treatment that works before a vaccine is available, he adds. Immediate treatment when symptoms come on could at least reduce the death rate.Yuen Kwok-yung, a professor of infectious disease at the University of Hong Kong, has advised his government that all social distancing can be relaxed – but only if people wear masks in enclosed spaces such as on trains and at work, and that no food or drink are consumed at concerts and cinemas.At restaurants, tables will have to be shielded from each other and serving staff will follow strict rules to prevent spreading the virus. “In our Hong Kong perspective, the diligent and correct use of reusable masks is the most important measure,” he says.Sarita Jane Robinson, a psychologist who studies responses to threats at the University of Central Lancashire, says people are still adapting to the “new normal” and that without more interventions – such as fines for not wearing face masks – “we could see people drifting back to old behaviours”.We might become blase about Covid-19 deaths when life resumes and the media move on, but the seriousness of the illness will make it harder to ignore, she says.One last possibility could save a lot of trouble. Some scientists wonder whether the common cold coronaviruses crossed into humans in the distant past and caused similar illness before settling down. “If the virus doesn’t change there’s no reason to think that miraculously in five years’ time it won’t still cause pneumonia,” says Perlman. “But that’s the hope: that we end up with a much more mild disease and you only get a bad cold from it.”Heymann says it is too soon to know how the pandemic will pan out. “We don’t understand the destiny of this virus,” he says. “Will it continue to circulate after its first pandemic? Or will it, like some other pandemic viruses, disappear or become less virulent? That we do not know.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Davis College pupils in Mallow, Co Cork, scoop top prize for work on plastic pollutionStrong backing for more ambition to address carbon emissions, according to pollDublin, Louth, Limerick, Clare and Galway properties most vulnerable, analysis finds"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4259641.1590091041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin and covid 19 car restrictions more space for bikes bus restrictions in the offing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBus-users are likely to see the biggest change, with buses erted away from College Green. Large-scale bus ersions, restrictions on cars and a widespread reallocation of road space to pedestrians and cyclists are planned under a new Covid-19 strategy for Dublin city centre.A joint National Transport Authority (NTA) and Dublin City Council Covid-19 “mobility intervention programme” seeks to turn the heart of Dublin city from St Stephen’s Green to Mountjoy Square, and the Custom House to Stoneybatter into a “pedestrian, cyclist, public transport priority zone”.However, this will necessitate significant changes to the bus network, as well as the opening of off-street car parks on the outskirts of the city.Once activity returns to the city, bicycle-use is expected to triple and walking to double.Car-use is expected to fall by 30 per cent, but public transport is due to take a far bigger hit, with usage down by 80 per cent, largely due to social distancing requirements.The mobility programme identifies 14 key routes into the city centre where significant traffic changes will be implemented, in addition to the creation of the city centre priority zone.On all routes more space will be given to cyclists and pedestrians. In many cases this will involve the removal of on-street parking and reduction of the number of traffic lanes. In some cases it may involve “car-free” areas and the use of “bus gates” in places such as the Rathmines Road.AlternativesThe report concedes “more people will wish to travel by car”. However, it said while city centre car parks could remain open, alternatives to driving directly into the “core” were needed. This could include the establishment of car parks on the periphery from where people could walk or cycle.In some cases streets could be car-free if businesses on the street were to request it to use the space for queueing and tables.Bus-users are likely to see the biggest change, with buses erted away from College Green.Bus stops will also be distributed over a wider area, with some “removed completely” if social distancing cannot be achieved.“It is likely that passengers will be required, in some instances, to walk further to bus stops to ensure a safer spread of bus loading unloading.”The “emphasis is on rapid and temporary types of intervention”, with additions and adjustments expected over the coming months as measures are implemented.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study findsFifty brain teasers on all things natural from sealife to flora and what tofu is made of"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw  The President Michael D Higgins has used an interview with an Italian communist newspaper to warn against a return to austerity and praise the response of Cuba to the Covid-19 crisis.He also said the Irish response to the crisis “seems to be bearing fruit” but warned about “serious problems” if pandemic regulations in Northern Ireland were different to those in the State.Mr Higgins said it was a “huge disappointment” for him to “see discrimination on the basis of age in the responses to the crisis by so many countries, even though they are motivated by the best intentions”.The Irish Government is amongst those to have introduced special advice for the over 70s to protect themselves from the virus.The President’s interview was carried in an edition of Il Manifesto, described as the “communist daily” although it has no links to any political party. Its reporter spoke to Mr Higgins remotely.A report on the interview has been circulated among senior officials and Ministers in Dublin, where his views are said to have raised some eyebrows.Mr Higgins revisited a theme familiar from the last economic crisis when he warned against any return of austerity policies.“The price paid for austerity is a situation that must not come up again,” he said. “It is time for a paradigm shift, and this change must take place in the streets of Europe.“I am in favour of universal basic services with an income that allows people to live, rather than simply a universal basic income that a system prone to exploitation could abuse. Universal basic services and a universal basic income are not contradictory, provided that priority is given to the former.”Mr Higgins was critical of the early response of the EU to the crisis, saying it “revealed a lack of collective action, not to mention a lack of solidarity in the unedifying competition for protective equipment and clothing, and even test materials”.Collective responsibilityHe also said that the recent decision of the German Constitutional Court – which called into question Germany’s participation in ECB bond-buying – “ is a serious threat to the Euro zone and the European Union itself”.However, when the subject was raised with him, the President praised the response of Cuba, which sent doctors and equipment to Northern Italy to help efforts to tackle the virus there.“The behaviour to which Cuba has accustomed us in responding to situations of grave need is an example of the acceptance of a collective responsibility that offers the best hope for an adequate response also to issues of sustainability, and even climate change. By sustainability I mean a form of eco-social economy that implies a consensus on the universality of fundamental rights,” he said.He also criticised aspects of international sanctions against Cuba and Iran. “The inclusion of the medicines and materials necessary for the response to Covid-19 in the restrictions applied to Cuba and Iran is a clear violation of international law, which merits universal condemnation,” Mr Higgins said.Mr Higgins said that the “language used to describe the vulnerability of older people has been revealing”.“Where has a sociological perspective gone? Narrow-minded behavioural perspectives prevailed, while the value of phenomenological approaches to social gerontology was lost. My concern now, as a sociologist, is that we are retreating into a coldness of interpersonal relationships that it has taken us decades to get away from,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4259525.1590080696!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain s post brexit trade plan for irish sea some gaping holes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrom January 1st smugglers could avail of a 5 per cent profit margin on copper alloy tubes from China if they can order them into Britain and then move them through the North into the Republic.Britain has released a paper laying out its vision for what trade across the Irish Sea will look like from January but it has several major holes.It lays out how London intends to implement last year’s agreement that the North will have special arrangements in order to avoid the need for checks on the border with the Republic.The “position paper” accepts this means there will be checks on goods going into Northern Ireland from Britain – something the UK government had previously denied – albeit while minimising their significance. But it leaves these key questions unanswered:Where will the checks be?Under the agreement, Britain is in the strange position of having the responsibility of enforcing the edge of the EU’s single market. To do this, the UK government paper says “no new infrastructure” will be required.However, according to British sources, this does not exclude the expansion of existing facilities at Belfast Airport, Belfast Port, and Warrenpoint. Moreover, extra inspections may be added to the current checks on animals that take place at Larne Harbour. Britain is set to inform the EU of its plans for these facilities by June.Britain proposes that checks on industrial goods are not necessary at the sea border and can take place through spot checks in shops and warehouses by agents employed by the Northern Ireland Executive. But as such goods could be driven directly from ports into the Republic and into the single market, this would appear to be a wide-open opportunity for smuggling, and the EU side is unlikely to agree to it.What about goods from the rest of the world?From January, the tariffs Britain applies on goods it imports from around the world will erge from EU tariffs. According to its new global tariff schedule, published this week, Britain will drop tariffs to zero on a number of products.Take the example of copper alloy tubes. The EU charges a 5 per cent tariff on imports of these from third countries with which it does not have a preferential trade deal. Britain says it will charge zero. Therefore, from January 1st smugglers could avail of a 5 per cent profit margin on copper alloy tubes from China if they can order them into Britain and then move them through the North into the Republic.How does Britain intend to prevent this? Its paper states that goods entering Northern Ireland will need “new electronic import declaration requirements, and safety and security information”. But if there are no border checks, how can these be verified?How are Irish goods told apart from Northern Irish ones?Britain stresses in its paper that there will be “no change to how Northern Ireland goods arrive in Great Britain ports compared to today”. It assures there will be no checks, and even “no additional process or paperwork”.However, a British source confirmed that goods from the Republic will be subject to checks, and that Irish companies will have to file an export declaration when selling into Britain.So how are Northern Ireland goods to be told apart from the goods of the Republic? Officials could not answer how products could be distinguished without any process or paperwork taking place.This potentially opens a hole to goods from anywhere in the EU accessing Britain’s market. An inability to guarantee the source of goods could be an issue as Britain tries to strike trade deals with new countries. It also raises fears among Northern Ireland businesses that their unique access into both the EU and Britain might not be so unique after all, and that they could be undercut.The question is further complicated in the case of goods that have components from both the Republic and Northern Ireland. To give one example, Baileys Irish Cream is a cross-Border hybrid. How would it be determined which part of the island goods originated from? Perhaps by estimating a percentage of their make-up? Officials couldn’t say."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4259661.1590095514!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord timing is everything as alan kelly blows another gasket","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour Leader Alan Kelly on the plinth in Leinster House on Thursday.

Inflation . . .” Leo was laying it out straight.“On the upside, we haven’t been shut out of the money markets.”“So the next government, whenever it takes office, will have to sail the ship of State through the hardest of rocks and the toughest of hard places.”It won’t be easy, but steering the way to safety “can be done”, he reassured the nation.And who (hint, hint) might be the leader to do that?The Fianna Fáil leader was next up with a sensible contribution on the crisis, a statesmanly bit at the end about co-operation between the EU states, and some well-justified criticism of the way the Government has handled the unwinding.“The ision between shops that are allowed to open and those which must remain closed simply makes no sense,” he said, citing the “foolish” distinction between hardware and homeware stores.It seems Micheál is a curtains-over-cans of paint man.Small businesses kept shuttered will applaud him for calling out those grasping big stores “actively trying to fill the gaps” in their absence from the market.“There is clear unfairness in that.”And what is the sense in opening the golf courses but only allowing access to people who live within 5km of them?“I don’t play golf,” stressed Micheál, anxious not to see his rating plummet further in polls.But he doesn’t want to appear difficult in a time of crisis. And he is also negotiating to go into government with Leo Varadkar.“I say this in a helpful way.”Oh, and there’s Alan Kelly, still waiting his turn, nursing his rumbling gasket.Micheál had given the Ceann Comhairle food for thought.“Next is deputy McDonald,” he said, as the Sinn Féin leader rose to her feet. “Do you play golf, by the way?”“No, not as of yet, Ceann Comhairle, but who’s to say? I might be resigned to playing golf if it is so desired by the public. Let’s hope not.”Was it our imagination or did Eamon Ryan sound more focused than usual? Nothing like an imminent leadership challenge to sharpen the game. The Green Party leader asked a number of questions. The Taoiseach thought his ideas about making more space available for cyclists and pedestrians during the crisis was excellent.“Every crisis does create opportunities,” said Leo, and he wasn’t referring to the leader of the Labour party, who was psyching himself to perform one of his famous scenes.This time, Alan Kelly was like a dog with a bone, worrying away at the health guidance for gatherings in Leinster House which landed among politicians on Tuesday morning and has been causing ructions every since. If Dáil proceedings are run according to them, it means no TD will be able to spend more than two hours in the chamber in any 24-hour period.Alan even brought along a prop.“I’ve my stopwatch with me because I’m back here later on. Not a joke.”The was nothing for it but to blow another gasket. It’s what he does best.The advice is totally unrealistic, he fumed. “It is absolutely bonkers. It’s bonkers.” He managed to say “bonkers” three times, just in case the headline writers didn’t hear it straight off.Then he quoted George Orwell.He also introduced a new word to us. He threw it around with abandon, returning to it when bearding the Minister for Health later in the afternoon with his same objections about important information which was only “socialised” to people at the beginning of the week.“Why was the public health information not socialised earlier?” he demanded.It sounds like corporatespeak, as in, “Hey guys, let’s socialise this idea with the stakeholders and harvest the learnings . . .”Simon Harris, who is somewhat impressionable when it comes to this sort of thing, then started using it in his replies. This must be stopped.However, he is forgiven because of the sweet way he bunged Alan’s gasket firmly back in place after being harried by him over the unworkable social distancing guidelines issued to the Oireachtas on Monday. Did NPHET (National Public Health Emergency Team) know anything about this? Why did NPHET not issue similar instructions for other workplaces?“You’re obsessed with NPHET. You’’ll be blaming NPHET for Covid next.”Kelly flew off again. “Withdraw that remark!”“OK, I withdraw that,” muttered the Minister.So fast you could barely hear him socialise it.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Pakistan International Airlines aircraft crashes in residential area of KarachiPro-democracy legislators criticise Bill which they say goes against framework of freedomsRescue teams hampered by torn-down power lines and flooding over large tracts of landPro-Beijing politicians are pushing contentious laws in the face of intense oppositionCyclone Amphan moving inland with gusts of up to 185kmh, says India met serviceSuper cyclone Amphan, with winds up to 160kmh, expected to hit India\u0026rsquos coast on WednesdayRules to be relaxed in areas with low numbers of infection, according to governmentIf Travis McCready\u0026rsquos US event goes ahead, it will look very different from typical rock gigsCity looks asymptomatic carriers after confirming first Covid cluster last weekend since release from lockdownLeader missed out on a seat as the venue was too full under Covid-19 restrictionsSecond most senior figure in Tibetan Buddhism was taken into custody when he was sixAid groups warn a humanitarian disaster looms in camps housing one million peopleBusinesses wrestle with capacity issues and lockdown debts as restrictions easeAttacks this week, including on maternity unit in Kabul, leave process hanging by threadAustralian arm of Genesis II group who wrote to Donald Trump fined $150,000City where pandemic began have reported first infections since lockdown was liftedChengdu Letter: History is repeating itself as Chinese officials threaten bereaved against legal actionRiot police intervene as renewed concern over Chinese power revives movementDean of hospital in Mumbai blamed families for not collecting the bodies of loved onesSouth Korean officials attribute new outbreak to one person who visited several barsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"The long-serving politician will become the first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoResidents in Mosul, still traumatised by violence, fear a resurgence of the terror groupRuling against Likud chief would likely trigger snap election, the fourth since April 2019Accelerating economic meltdown has left country\u0026rsquos poorest without work and incomeCases in region limited to 17 with no deaths recorded thanks to effective quarantineDecree expected to spare lives of at least six men accused of taking part in Arab SpringStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4259636.1590090603!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"signs of life in london as public vote on lockdown with their feet","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA woman sunbathes on a deck chair in Greenwich Park, London on Tuesday. Photograph: Kirsty O’ConnorPA WireIt was just before eight in the morning and like most people in London these days, the man queuing in front of me outside the bakery was complaining about the government. As a businessman, he could identify every one of the failures of project management behind the bungling of the coronavirus response and the delay in testing, tracking and tracing.“Look at South Korea. Look at Germany, ” he was saying.“Look out behind you,” I said as a builder walked past with a length of timber over his shoulder.We turned to talking about the bakery, a shrine to sourdough in the heart of Belgravia in which every customer agrees it is a privilege to be allowed to shop. The interior is cold, dark and silent with all the joviality of a 19th\u0026nbspcentury French peasant’s dwelling the day after most of his children have died.Along a shelf on the side wall stand the giant, two-kilo sourdough loaves the size of basketballs and below them a handful of smaller rye and walnut loaves. A sorrowful young woman in a brown pinafore and beige apron keeps watch behind a counter laden with straw baskets, one of them filled with the turd-shaped sourdough rolls that nourished the impoverished artists of Montparnasse in the middle of the last century.The shop is so small that social distancing allows only one customer inside at a time and before the businessman went inside, he told me he never accepted a loaf from the shelf.“I tell them to go in and get me one from the back. They don’t like it,” he said.“I’m sure they don’t,” I said.I didn’t like his attitude and catching the eye of the woman behind me, I recognised another true believer and could see she didn’t like it either. When he was gone, we both gazed at a plate of brown raisin rolls in the dingy shop window.“Marvellous, isn’t it?” I said.“A lifeline,” she said.Chilly indifferenceThe bakery remained open throughout the lockdown while everything around it was closed but there have been signs of life in the neighbourhood this week.My favourite French restaurant is offering a reduced menu for takeaway, ingeniously conveying the chilly indifference that is the house style by charging more for each dish than when they served it inside. You have to put in your order 24 hours in advance and everything is cold when you pick it up and has to be reheated at home.The dry cleaners which had been opening only on Saturdays is now open every day as more people return to work. The long queues outside supermarkets have all but disappeared and the sound of traffic has started to drown out the birdsong again.The man who sells coffee and sandwiches from the green wooden kiosk on the square near the Tube station says the builders are busier than ever and they’re keeping him going.“The government is driving us down, down, down. The country’s got to get moving,” he said.The London Underground remains empty most of the time and station announcements urge passengers not to take the Tube but to walk or cycle instead. But on a couple of days this week, there were no recorded cases of coronavirus in London and many businesses in the capital are eager to open up again.\u0026nbspSchool isionsTheir impatience is shared by much of the Conservative parliamentary party but polls show that the public is wary of easing the lockdown too soon. Nowhere are the isions deeper than over whether to reopen schools for some children on June 1st, as Boris Johnson has said he wants to.The government’s plan is for the equivalent of junior infants, senior infants and fifth class in primary school to go back first, with third year and fifth year in secondary school to follow soon afterwards. But YouGov found this week that the British public oppose the plan by 50 per cent to 36 per cent. 18-24 year-olds are especially critical of the approach, with 56 per cent opposing it compared with 42 per cent among those over 65.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspData collected by Google for Public Health England has found, however, that the number of people visiting parks is approaching pre-lockdown levels and footfall around transit hubs and workplaces has been rising gradually.Despite what they tell the pollsters, British people are apparently either voting with their feet in favour of a return to work or finding themselves unable to manage without it.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"children half likely adults catch coronavirus ucl study finds","story":"Children and teenagers are over 50 per cent less likely than adults to catch coronavirus, research by University College London suggests.The UCL team said their research, which comes amid heated debate about Government plans to reopen schools next month, suggested childen are likely to play a smaller role in transmitting the virus and proliferating the pandemic compared with adults.Researchers examined more than 6,000 studies, analysing 18 in detail, which examined the spread of disease among children.They concluded that those below the age of 20 had 56 per cent lower odds of catching SARS-CoV-2 from an infected person than adults. However, they added that it remained uncertain how likely children are to pass the virus on.Lead author Professor Russell Viner, of UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, said: Our findings show that children and young people appear 56 per cent less likely to contract Covid-19 from infected others.Susceptibility is a key part of the chain of infection, and this supports the view that children are likely to play a smaller role in transmitting the virus and proliferating the pandemic, although considerable uncertainty remains.The study could not establish whether younger children were any less likely to be susceptible to the virus than older ones.Researchers said most children have asymptomatic infection, meaning they were likely to be less infectious than those with symptoms, but they added that it was important to take into account the social behaviour of children, such as how many people they were likely to be in contact with as well as levels of physical interaction.Researchers concluded that their findings imply children are likely to play a lesser role in transmission of Covid-19 at a population level because fewer are likely to be infected in the first place. However, they did not establish the extent to which children can transmit the virus once infected.The analysis said there were few studies examining transmission rates of the virus, and said the evidence that existed was weak.Prof Viner said: It\u0027s preliminary evidence, but the weight of evidence, I think in summary, is clear that children appear to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.We don\u0027t have any data on transmissiblity. We clearly have a state of uncertainty. I believe it is not helpful to make statements about what is safe and not safe as absolutes. All safety is a degree of safety.There are safety issues walking out of our front doors, there are safety issues getting in our cars to drive our children to school – we cannot ever say something is safe or unsafe.It is well known that children and young people make up only a very small percent of confirmed clinical cases of Covid-19 in most countries, including the UK. Children and teenagers make up an even smaller proportion of severe cases or deaths.However, such data about confirmed infection among clinical cases tells us little about susceptibility or transmission as most children have few, if any, symptoms and therefore many do not present for testing or come to the attention of doctors.Fellow author Professor Chris Bonell, from the the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said schools should take steps to try to break up the chain of transmission.These could include an onoff rota so pupils attend school on alternate days, and steps to limit contact between parents at school gates.Researchers said there was limited research examining the likelihood of transimission from children to others, describing the strength of Australian research which found very limited spread in schools as very weak.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus conspiracy theories fifth people believe virus hoax","story":"More than 4 in 10 people believe to some extent that China created coronavirus as a bioweapon to control the west, new research on Covid-19 conspiracy theories has suggested.A new survey has revealed that when asked whether they believed that coronavirus is a bio-weapon developed by China to destroy the West, 55 per cent said they did not agree, 20.2 per cent said they agreed a little and 5.5 per cent agreed completely.The research, led by clinical psychologists at the University of Oxford and published in the journal Psychological Medicine, indicates the number of adults in England do not agree with the scientific and governmental consensus on the Covid-19 pandemic.It revealed that almost three fifths (59 per cent) of adults in England believe to some extent that the Government is misleading the public about the cause of the virus.More than a fifth (21 per cent) believe the virus is a hoax, and 62 per cent agree to some extent that the virus is man-made, scientists say.While 70.9 per cent said they did not agree the WHO already has a vaccine and are withholding it and 79 per cent said they did not agree that coronavirus is caused by 5G and is a form of radiation poisoning transmitted through radio waves.From May 4-11, 2,500 adults - representative of the English population for age, gender, region, and income - took part in the Oxford Coronavirus Explanations, Attitudes, and Narratives Survey (Oceans) online.Researchers found that approximately 50 per cent of this population showed little evidence of conspiracy thinking, 25 per cent showed a degree of endorsement, 15 per cent showed a consistent pattern of endorsement, and 10 per cent had very high levels of endorsement.Higher levels of coronavirus conspiracy thinking were associated with less adherence to all Government guidelines, the study suggests.The authors write: Higher levels of coronavirus conspiracy thinking were associated with less adherence to all Government guidelines and less willingness to take diagnostic or antibody tests or to be vaccinated.Such ideas were also associated with paranoia, general vaccination conspiracy beliefs, climate change conspiracy belief, a conspiracy mentality, and distrust in institutions and professions.Holding coronavirus conspiracy beliefs was also associated with being more likely to share opinions.Daniel Freeman, professor of clinical psychology, University of Oxford, and consultant clinical psychologist, Oxford Health NHS Foundation, said: Those who believe in conspiracy theories are less likely to follow government guidance, for example, staying home, not meeting with people outside their household, or staying two metres apart from other people when outside.Those who believe in conspiracy theories also say that they are less likely to accept a vaccination, take a diagnostic test, or wear a face mask.He added that the epidemic has all the necessary ingredients for the growth of conspiracy theories, including” sustained threat, exposure of vulnerabilities, and enforced change”.Prof Freeman went on to explain that the beliefs were “corrosive to our necessary collective response to the crisis”.The research also suggests that conspiracy theories are becoming more commonplace in wider society.Dr Sinéad Lambe, Clinical Psychologist, said: “Conspiracy thinking is not isolated to the fringes of society and likely reflects a growing distrust in the government and institutions. Conspiracy beliefs arguably travel further and faster than ever before.“Our survey indicates that people who hold such beliefs share them social media provides a ready-made platform.”“In the wake of the epidemic, mistrust looks to have become mainstream,” Prof Freeman added.The research project is funded by the NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/28/11/harry-potter-book.jpg","title":"are harry potter book philosophers stone hardback skip auction","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.News comes shortly after author JK Rowling revealed the true ‘birthplace’ of her popular wizarding seriesA first edition of the first book in JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series has sold for £33,000 at auction, after the owner discovered it in a skip. The rare hardback copy of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was found in a skip in 2008 by a teacher at school in Buckinghamshire, and stored in her loft.The copy was sold with four other books from the series, which had also been thrown away.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesJust 500 copies of The Philosopher’s Stone were printed in 1997. The book sold at auction had an estimated price of £8,000 to £12,000.Two first editions of The Philosopher’s Stone sold for £3,400 and £3,000, while first editions of The Chamber of Secrets and The Prisoner of Azkaban fetched £360.

Due to its condition, we thought £20,000 would be a good result. We watched the auction and the price just kept going up and up.”“I love books and reading and it just seemed awful to throw them away, so I picked up about five Harry Potter books,” she continued. “I thought they might be useful for my children or grandchildren in the future. It was better than seeing them go to waste.”JK Rowling recently revealed where she first started writing the Harry Potter books, contradicting fans who believed for years that Edinburgh was its birthplace.The Elephant House Cafe in Edinburgh is widely regarded as the place the now 54-year-old author wrote the first of the seven fantasy novels.While it is true that Rowling used to frequent the cafe in the early days of her writing career, the author revealed yesterday (21 May) that she actually started the series in London, in a flat above a sports shop in Clapham.Referring to the sign on Elephant House which reads “birthplace of Harry Potter”, Rowling tweeted: “I’d been writing Potter for several years before I ever set foot in this cafe, so it’s not the birthplace, but I *did* write in there so we’ll let them off!”Rowling then shared a picture of the Clapham flat where she started her writing process. “This is the true birthplace of Harry Potter,” she said. “If you define ‘birthplace’ as the spot where I put pen to paper for the first time.”Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u0027s Stone\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

MsTucker, who works at a Sephora beauty store in San Jose, California, had not heard of Musk until she started receiving his messages.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMobile network AT\u0026ampT assigned Tucker the number when Musk stopped using it, yet some websites listed it as Musk’s current number, resulting in numerous calls and messages.“I asked my mom, ‘Hey, I keep getting these text messages’ – and I was also now starting to get phone calls – ‘for this guy Elon Musk. I don’t know who this is’,” Tucker said. “And my mom’s jaw just dropped.”Elon Musk fears he will die before SpaceX makes it to MarsTucker has apparently received calls from a woman volunteering to go to space, an IRS representative calling about tax issues, a South African businessman who wanted to purchase 1,000 vehicles, and another with a blueprint for a bionic limb “which is, number one, really cool, but I have no idea how it’s built,” Tucker said.Tulsa unveils giant statue of Elon Musk to try and lure TeslaMatrix director slams Elon Musk and Ivanka Trump for ‘red pill’ tweetsElon Musk tweets ‘Facebook sucks’ at company’s Head of AIShe also received texts from Former Walt Disney executive John Lasseter about his recently purchased Tesla.However, Tucker often has to prove that she is not Musk to those calling her. “They say, ‘Oh, how do I know you’re not Elon?’,” she said. “And they suddenly want proof that I’m not him even though they’re obviously talking to a woman on the phone.” Reached for comment by NPR, Musk said “Wow.

We’re always experimenting with future concepts using different hardware configurations as part of our proof-of-experience process” Bozworth also tweeted.Virtual reality is content computer-generated in three dimensions in a digital environment, while augmented reality – or mixed reality – is digital content layered over a real-world environment, such as Pokemon Go.The news comes as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that half of its workforce will likely work remotely over the next five to ten years.“We need to do this in a way that’s thoughtful and responsible, so we’re going to do this in a measured way, he said. But I think that it’s possible that over the next five to 10 years — maybe closer to 10 than five, but somewhere in that range — I think we could get to about half of the company working remotely permanently.“VR and AR is all about giving people remote presence. So if you’re long on VR and AR and on video chat, you have to believe in some capacity that you’re helping people be able to do whatever they want from wherever they are. So I think that that suggests a worldview that would lead to allowing people to work more remotely over time.” What has Facebook done to fix election interference since 2016?Facebook wants to build a ‘hateful meme’ AI to clean up its platformFacebook’s Oculus is developing a new Quest VR headsetThe company also published a blog post  saying that it would create a “super-powered augmented workspace with multiple customizable screens in VR, unbounded from the limits of ​physical monitors.”It would use Passthrough – a technology used on Facebook’s Oculus virtual reality hardware that lets you “temporarily step outside VR to see a real-time view of the world around you” - to let people switch between their real and virtual worlds with the hope that by “combining the flexibility of new inputs like hand tracking with the familiarity of everyday input devices like a keyboard and mouse, we could give people the best of both worlds.”The company is also developing virtual avatars called Codec Avatars which would “let people in the future create lifelike virtual avatars of themselves quickly and easily, helping social connections in virtual reality become as natural and common as those in the real world.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The final ever scene of Lost is intercut between events on the island and an alternate timeline known as the flashsideways – scenes that replace the flashbacks and flashforwards for the entire final season.Lost turns 15: Every single episode ranked, from worst to bestThese flashsideways scenes come after Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell), stuck in the 1970s, detonates a hydrogen bomb in the closing moments of season five in an attempt to prevent the hatch from ever being built. The logic is that, should the hatch never be created, Oceanic Flight 815 will never crash on the island. The flashsideways show what would have happened had the plane landed safely in Los Angeles.All season long, viewers see the characters rubbing shoulders with one another in Los Angeles, unaware of the events of the past five seasons.Eventually, these characters are drawn together and begin to recall their time on the island, which leads to the final scene’s revelation: they are actually dead in the flashsideways, which is essentially a netherworld the survivors created in order to congregate so they can move on together to “whatever comes next”.So, to clear up the confusion: in the flashsideways scenes, these characters are dead. But no, they were not dead all along after the plane crashed.The flashsideways scenes depict an afterlife that the characters constructed for themselves due to the fact that their time on the island – which was completely real from start to end – was the most important part of their respective lives.The characters present in that final church scene are characters both dead and alive in island time, meaning several characters (including Kate, Sawyer and Claire) went on to live a full life beyond the series finale.These flashsideways scenes present a purgatory-of-sorts, where these characters come to when they eventually do die whenever that may be. When broken down, it’s a beautiful and reassuring depiction of the afterlife.The plane crash, the smoke monster, the hatch, the island – it was all real.Of course, it almost all ended rather differently...Find a ranking of every single Lost episode here\u0026nbspand check back tomorrow (23 May) for an oral history on the finale, with contributions from co-creator Damon Lindelof and actors Evangeline Lilly, Henry Ian Cusick and Jorge Garcia.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The rocket can reach a height of approximately 100km, and carry a payload of up to 60kg.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It is very hard to oversell what we have achieved here with this test the whole team has pulled through again to deliver another UK first, said Dr Jack-James Marlow, who led the operations of Skylark L’s static fire testing.We have successfully static tested a fully integrated, sub-orbital Skylark L launch vehicle in flight configuration. This means we performed all actions of a launch but did not release the vehicle. The rocket engine successfully burned, with all vehicle systems showing nominal operation.”Trump says ‘space is the future’ at unveiling of Space Force flagAstronomers find ‘regular rhythms’ coming from distant starsSpace debris from failed rocket misses New York City by minutesSkyrora’s chief executive officer, Volodymyr Levykin said: “As the launch aspect of the UK’s new space industry starts to emerge, there will be many events that have never happened here previously and this is one of them. This was a mammoth effort in very trying circumstances, so it is quite an achievement to be proud of.”The company claims this is the first static fire test of its magnitude since the Black Arrow Programme, a three-stage British satellite carrier rocket that was used for four launches between 1969 and 1971.In September 1970, the Black Arrow attempted to carry a British satellite, Orba, into space, but failed to reach orbit. The next year, however, it did carry the Prospero satellite into space, which made the United Kingdom the sixth nation to place a satellite into orbit via a carrier rocket.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some countries’ emissions dropped by as much as 26 per cent on average during the peak of the confinement.Visualising the biggest carbon crash ever recordedIf pre-pandemic conditions return by mid-June, then 2020 emissions could decline by a more modest 4 per cent compared to 2019, though this would still be the largest single annual decrease in absolute emissions since the end of World War II.A UN report last year said emissions needed to drop by 2.7 per cent a year keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, and 7.6 per cent a year to keep below 1.5C.“Population confinement has led to drastic changes in energy use and CO2 emissions,” said lead author Corinne Le Quéré at the University of East Anglia.“These extreme decreases are likely to be temporary, however, as they do not reflect structural changes in the economic, transport, or energy systems,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Emissions from residential buildings, however, increased by 5 per cent, the study said.“The emissions reductions occurring because of Covid-19 will clearly be unprecedented. What is less certain is how the economy will rebound in late 2020 and 2021,” said Glen Peters at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway, which took part in the study.“As different countries and sectors recover, it is unclear if activity levels will return to normal levels or if we may see permanent shifts in behaviour,” he added.The environmental impact of coronavirus containment measures has also led to a huge reduction in air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, which are released by cars, aeroplanes and other combustion engines.Satellite images captured by the European Space Agency showed a dramatic decrease in NO2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2019.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They will go on sale shortly.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It’s great to be able to help people in need by creating digital images, especially since most people aren’t allowed out in the world during the lockdown,” he said.“I’ve made the postcards so that everyone has a chance to own one, and all the profits will be donated to charity.How to support our campaign“It feels right to show what can be done from a lockdown situation with a bit of computer magic and lateral thinking.”The images show the butterfly heart design, which was created by the artist for our appeal as a symbol of “solidarity and hope”, being superimposed on buildings in London and across the country, including the Tower of London, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey.The limited-edition print of the rainbow butterfly image can be purchased in two sizes, priced at £300 and £1,000.

No clear lines of responsibility,\u0027\u0026nbspNobel Prize winner saysOne of the UK’s most distinguished scientists has launched a scathing attack on Boris Johnson’s government, claiming the response to the coronavirus pandemic has been “too much on the back foot” during successive crises.Sir Paul Nurse, the director of the Francis Crick Institute and Nobel Prize winner, said he was “desperate for clear leadership” at all levels and suggested responsibility for dealing with the virus had been similar to a game of “pass the parcel”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the geneticist was also critical of the initial lack of Covid-19 testing, insisting smaller laboratories could have been used across the country to increase capacity and said that hospitals became “potentially unsafe places to be”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I’m not quite sure we are getting it right, and I think you\u0027re quite right to say that everybody involved - not just the politicians, the scientists and the doctors - we\u0027re all making mistakes,” Sir Paul said.“And we have to try and learn from what mistakes have been made up until now. I get a sense the UK has been rather too much on the back foot, increasingly playing catch-up, fire-fighting through successive crises.”  Created with Sketch.How coronavirus lockdowns changed the world\u0027s most polluted cities Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Addressing leadership during the crisis, Sir Paul went on: The question I keep asking myself is: Do we have a proper government system in here that can combine tentative knowledge, scientific knowledge, with political action?“And the question I\u0027m constantly asking myself is: Who is actually in charge of the decisions? Who is developing the strategy and the operation and implementation of that strategy? Is it ministers? Is it Public Health England? The National Health Service? The Office for Life Scientists, Sage? I don\u0027t know, but more importantly, do they know?“It was little like pass the parcel. No clear lines of responsibility. I’m desperate for clear leadership at all levels.” On demands for a public inquiry, Sir Paul added: “I don’t think we should initiate a formal inquiry now. We should do it later. What we need is more openness, we need to have greater debate in the public domain, we need to recognise when we don’t understand things and communicate that to the public. “We have lions on the frontline of clinical care, we need lions also in the leadership so that we can actually drive this forward. I wouldn’t investigate them at the moment, I would just demand more of them.”Responding to his remarks, Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the BBC: “I just wouldn’t agree with that. What we’ve seen through this actually is we as a government have been very clear with people, very transparent with people. “The prime minister himself has been very clear that the prime minister is ultimately responsible. We do want to follow the best advice that is out there from both the scientific advisers and our chief medical advisers and the teams there, but ultimately it is the ministers who make decisions.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The monthly total is the lowest since HMRC began collecting data in April 2005. HMRC’s report said the impact of coronavirus was evident in the transaction numbers.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe housing market was largely put on hold from 25 March until it was reopened last week.Deals already underway could go ahead but the government urged buyers and sellers in the process of completing a deal to avoid people moving during lockdown where possible.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?In England, moves can now go ahead again, estate agents can open and physical viewings can be carried out. However, restrictions remain in other parts of the UK.Andrew Southern, chair of property developer Southern Grove, said: “Residential transactions are usually motivated by necessity so, subject to the economic realities that prevail as the country starts to emerge from this crisis, many of these missing sales should rise from the deep.”On Tuesday, property website Rightmove enjoyed its busiest day since Thursday 5 March, with nearly 5.3 million visits. Rightmove’s housing market expert, Miles Shipside, said: “One week on from the surprise opening of the housing market and agents are still showing caution and quite rightly putting safety first, but many had already started to prepare during lockdown and so have been able to start reopening their branches and conducting viewings.“The activity jump on Rightmove proves the determination of home movers to continue with their plans over the next few months.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

and the number can also inform policy decisions about how to contain an outbreak.For example,a virus has an R of three, it means that every sick person will pass the disease on to three other peopleno containment measures are introduced.Its also worth pointing out that the R is a measure of how infectious a disease is, but not how deadly.Taking London as an example, with a current R value of . for coronavirus, it means that for every ten people who have the virus, it will be passed on to only four more people.The low R value means thateveryone continues lockdown and social distancing measures, London would theoretically be virus free by the end of May. The World Health Organisationestimated at the start of March that the coronavirus R stood somewhere between  and ..The UK is now generally below that because of the lockdown and the social distancing measures we have been doing over the past two months.In comparison, the seasonal flu is estimated to be roughly . while measles has a reproductive value of between  and .Despite this, these figures are not set in stone because a given pathogens R value changes with place and time.Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, told The : R is an indication of how much an infectious virus will spread in a population, and ious things impact that value.The susceptibility, size and density of the population that the infection is introduced into matters, as well as the infectiousness of the virus itself.Predictions of the R for Covid- are currently ied because no one knows exactly how many people have been infected in total.According to modelling published by Imperial College London, the R value stood somewhere between  and . in Europe before lockdowns came into effect.The most recent estimate of the nation-wide R-rate is said to be between . and .Below R is the important bit because it means the virus will likely peter out, but things are generally worse in the north of England to the point that the trend could reverse.New data released May  from Cambridge University suggests that in the North East and Yorkshire the R rate - the average number of people an infected person can pass the virus on to - is feared to be at around ..The South West has an R rate of ., slightly more than the North West which has a rate of ..Both the East of England and South East have a rate of ., followed by the Midlands with . and finally London with ..On May , , Boris Johnson urged the British public to help reduce the R value.In his address to the nation, he said: It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down.He added: We must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre.And that Covid Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases.He continued: And in turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures.The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.During one of the Downing Street press conferences, Sir Patrick Vallance revealed that it was highly likely there is an R value in the community of less than one.This means that every infected inidual passes the disease to less than one other person.This shows the lockdown has had a positive impact on the coronavirus outbreak as to bring an outbreak under control the R value needs to fall below one.However, when the number remains higher than one, the epidemic will grow. Sir Patrick admitted that the R value could be higher in some care homes and hospitals.He said: As I’ve said, it’s not true that the R is necessarily below one in every hospital or in every care home, and that’s the important area that we now need to look at and make sure that the appropriate measures are in place to try and reduce the R there.But it doesn’t change the overall view that I’ve described, that the R overall is below one and therefore we expect to see the slowing and the turn of the epidemic.There are lots of infection control measures experts can use to push this number down and reduce the spread.A study in the Lancet in April, for example, estimated that travel restrictions in Wuhan caused R to drop from . to . after just one week.Sir Patrick said that the draconian social distancing measures introduced in the UK have had a substantial impact so far.This is because as less people come into contact with one another, there is less chance for the virus to spread.He said on Thursday, April : The social distancing measures are needed to reduce the levels right down to a low level.At that point there may be decisions about which ones to relax and which ones not to relax.It’s important to keep the R below one, and this is all about trying to reduce contacts, particularly between households, reduce transmission and keep the levels low across the community.And Sir Patrick added that even small changes in the measures that are in place could lead to the R going above one.According to a pre-print study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the average number of people an inidual comes into contact with each day has dropped by  per cent since the UK’s lockdown began.“This would be sufficient to reduce R from a value from . before the lockdown to . during the lockdown, indicating that physical distancing interventions are effective,” the study, which tracked over , adults and has not yet been peer reviewed, concluded.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They also analyse the risk of public disorder under ious scenarios, including staff shortages in the police force owing to sickness and increased pressure on health services.No, SAGE isnt a decision making body, but their advice is respected.While ministers can do what they like within reason, they have other mitigating factors to consider, like financial, political, social, global and practical restraints.But for now most people are following the advice of the experts.Measures like social distancing are working and we are seeing that the advice is working everywhere where it is taken seriously.Sadly we can also see rising risks in areas that dont social distance. This puts everyone in the UK and the world at further risk until we can find a vaccine and find an end to the coronavirus pandemic.SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below. "},{"url":null,"title":"caravan sites open uk","story":"Brits were ordered to stay at home and not to visit second homes, campsites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays.Despite there being some easing of lockdown measures from Wednesday, May , Matt Hancock has said it summer holidays are likely to be canceled.Changes in restrictions laid out so far do not impact caravan sites.While people can travel from their home for exercise, you are currently not allowed to stay somewhere other than your own home.Mr Hancock said: This isnt for people to move house or to go on holiday or to be able to stay.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has laid out a three-step plan for reopening the country - but holidays are not mentioned in the -page document.However, it is hoped the final stage of the initial plans will begin in July - so there could be more clarity for caravan fans after then.Meanwhile, here is what the caravan parks, holiday clubs and camping sites say:The Camping and Caravanning Club released a new statement on May  saying they will be closed until at least July.Haven has extended the closure all of its sites until at least July  in an announcement on May .Center Parcs is also closed until June  at the very earliest, and it said we know the closure period may well extend further.The Caravan Club has said it opens to begin a phased reopening in July.Parkdean Resorts has also extended the closure of parks to holidaymakers and owners until at May .Hoseasons announced it is now only accepted new bookings for dates after June .Park Holidays is only taking bookings online for holidays beginning in July.Company Holidaylettings is reviewing its policy for travel after July , based on what will happen during what it calls this unpredictable situation.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Away Resorts has temporarily closed all parks for the foreseeable future and isnt accepting any new bookings until after July .John Fowler Holidays has shut all parks until May , and are offering refunds or rescheduled holidays.Lyons Holiday Parks has cancelled all holidays up to May  and are currently offering  holidays at  prices.This is unclear - theres no real government advice on this yet with regards to holidays.However, in larger resorts, it may be that customers can easily keep their distancing from one another.In other industries, its been suggested there could be caps on the number of people allowed to use a particular site at any one time.Ministers are due to unveil new Covid- Secure guidelines for businesses before May .It is expected this will lay out clearly restrictions on numbers of customers and staff.Britain also now has a new Covid Alert System - a five tier warning level that dictates how many restrictions should be adhered to by the public.This rises and falls relative to the spread of the virus, with the PM saying we are currently in Level  and heading for Level .Despite easing of lockdown measures on May , the government insists you must continue to always stay two metres away from people not in your household.Some of the big companies, such as Haven, are offering one of three options - a full refund, vouchers that can be used for a later holiday, or that customers simply re-book later in the year.Parkdean is offering a voucher, with an additional  per cent incentive, or a refund.Hoseasons is offering e-vouchers, and bosses say theyd encourage customers to sht holidays to a later date.Lawyers from company IBB Law say each park owner will have an inidual contract with a holidaymaker.This will feature terms and conditions which apply to bookings, and can be checked for cancellation rights.Some sites may have a term which means that they are not liable for any failure to perform their part of the contractthis is caused by unforeseen circumstances outside their control.It is likely that the forced closure of the park due to coronavirus would be considered such an event.However, most holiday bookings are likely to be covered by the Consumer Rights Act , which prevents the park from failing to offer the service bought by the customer.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It might feel strange at first, but we’ll get used to it.Militant unions telling teachers they should refuse to go back to work must also urgently rethink their stance.Reopening schools is obviously essentialwe are to prevent the poorest and most vulnerable children falling behind — new research reveals that better-off children are spending a whopping  per cent more time each day on education than those from poorer homes.But as parents can only go back to work once their kids are in class, it’s also the only way to kickstart the economy.Of course, there will always be an element of risk to getting society up and running again. Even before coronavirus, it would have been impossible for anyone to guarantee the safety of every worker every day.But the Government has stressed it’s “extremely unlikely” a school could be the source of a Covid- outbreak.And given the risks frontliners take every single day, that assurance should be good enough for teaching unions.WE welcome the news that the Government plans to push ahead with legislation to end free movement and replace it with a points-based immigration system before the end of this year.The new system is exactly what Brexit-voting Sun readers wanted: it will let us welcome the brightest and best — including doctors, nurses and carers — to the UK based on what they have to offer, not where they come from.And it’s logical to get it introduced quickly so businesses have time to prepare before the transition period ends.Let’s hope MPs have the sense to back the bill.WE can all sleep a little more soundly in our beds now the Government looks set to hit its target of recruiting , contact-tracers by the end of next week.It’s been obvious for a long time that widespread testing and tracing is the best way to contain the virus: all the countries that have fared best have been doing it from the start.But thanks to dodgy advice from Public Health England, Boris and his ministers gave up on it back in March.What a relief they’ve finally seen the light.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially my track, Alive.”The music didn’t disappoint, either, ranging all the way from the excellent Icelandic entry, Think Of Things, to knock-kneed techno from some Russian live-wires called Little Big.My personal highlight, though, was the nutty Latvian bird, Samanta Tina, who turned up for her promotional video wearing a PPE mask and squirting a bottle of disinfectant everywhere.If ever it got a bit too “Eurovision”, though, there was a special guest on hand to calm the mood down.Sweden’s Mans Zelmerlow sang Heroes in his back garden , Italy’s Diodato slowly murdered Volare in a CGI amphitheatre and Ireland’s Johnny Logan had either aged quite dramatically or had to be replaced, right at the last second, by Julian Assange on the poignant What’s Another Year.The one constant, though, was Norton, who handled Eurovision’s new socially-distanced, time-delayed, non-competitive format as brilliantly as he did the old one and was in no mood to spare feelings.“Samanta Tina. She’s tried to represent Latvia six times, Lithuania twice and now she’s got through it’s been cancelled. You’d think she’d take the hint, wouldn’t you.”“Serbia’s answer to The Pussycat Dolls, when the question is — name a group that isn’t as good as The Pussycat Dolls ”It was a joy to watch after seeing so many hosts and shows fail spectacularly with “the new normal” and my only real complaint was that there wasn’t enough of him or the event.I wanted a vote as well, of course. But by the time I was ready for Norton to annihilate the regional juries, it was all over.Lesson learned, though. If I ever take this event for granted or complain about the running time again, you have permission to shoot me down in righteous flames.Meantime, stay hellzy.The Real Marigold Hotel, Britt Ekland: “I look in the mirror — it’s OK. I’m not going to scare the children.”Channel  continuity introducing The Last Leg: Locked Down Under: “Two comedy geniuses coming right up here, Aisling Bea and Kevin Bridges.” So, one comedy genius then. And Aisling Bea.BACK in southern India, on BBC’s hugely enjoyable series The Real Marigold Hotel, Duncan Bannatyne has just bottled the eight-hour overnight train journey to Madurai.It could’ve been the heat, it could’ve been the food and a dodgy stomach.Or it could’ve been the fact Britt Ekland is all over him like a cheap sari, no matter how many times the multi-millionaire businessman mentions his “young we”.A woman who will not be denied, Britt needs male validation and constant reassurance.So, during one of the brief moments she wasn’t pestering Duncan to within an inch of his le, Britt visited a vedic astrologer, in downtown Puducherry, and hit him with this loaded question. “Am I going to have work ”Work  Are you ever, Britt. “The sun is in the constellation of Hasta,” apparently.So I’d expect work on your face, work on your eyelids, work on your rear end. A work frenzy, in fact.As for actual employment, though I think we can safely say Venus’s transit is currently “resting’ and her earth signs will be “aspecting”, until the panto equinox. So I’d go with Plan A Duncan.Yet when Miriam Margolyes told The Last Leg she wanted Boris Johnson to die from coronavirus they said nothing.So do you think this is because A Equity’s learned its lesson about rushing to judgment  Or B The thought she’d said something wrong never entered their thick, hypocritical luvvie heads No need to reply.Danny Murphy: “Spurs have always been consistently inconsistent.”Joe Root: “We have to make sure players don’t get ill, or even unwell.”WORST TV show of the lockdown  I’ll hear your pleas on behalf of Have I Got News For You, Gemma Collins: Diva On Lockdown, The Mash Report, The Steph Show and Mo Gilligan, whose All Star Happy Hour on Channel  makes Rob  Romesh look like Abbott  Costello.But they can, I suppose, all use technology as an excuse. Only stupidity and a tin ear for the public mood can explain my own choice for that title.It’s BBC’s credit card roulette series I’ll Get This, which concluded last week with Fleur East, Johnny Vegas, Mike Tindall, John Barnes and Sue Perkins taking part in a series of minor challenges and guessing games, in a roped-off area of a London restaurant, to settle a £ dinner bill.Not the sort of guessing games that might have engaged viewers, like “guess the appearance fee” or “guess how many TV presenters would have to die before Sue got another stab at hosting the Baftas”, but a game of “Guess the weight of the waiter”.A task more suited to the Bullingdon Club, you’d imagine, but this lot prodded him, lted him and generally talked about him like he was invisible.“I can squat it.” “Oh God, he’s big boned.”Having established, beyond reasonable doubt, there was almost nothing the five celebrities wouldn’t do to get on television, it was the response to the next question – “Do you like or dislike being famous ” – that sealed its place in lockdown hell for me.Unanimously they went for the latter, not with any self-awareness or sarcasm, but with a genuine sense of hurt that anyone could think otherwise and former Celebrity Big Brother contestant Sue Perkins apparently speaking for them all when she very solemnly replied: “I love my job, I dislike being famous.”Some job, Sue.

toll from Covid-, everyone unaffected knows they’re lucky to even be alive.So it’s not the “First-World problem” of having to cancel a holiday that’s the issue.It’s the potential loss of big money — on top of what they’ve already lost during lockdown — that’s worrying people.And Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s declaration that summer holidays are “very unlikely” doesn’t help one bit when it comes

Its vast bureaucratic institutions were utterly unable to react to the threat of the virus.So the inidual countries did it all for themselves. Each following a dferent policy. When the moment came, the EU was found wanting. Lethargic, hopeless and riven with internal dispute.There is fury in Spain that the EUwon’t bung them loads of money for being badly hit by the virus.It’s the same in Italy, where  per cent of the population now want to LEAVE the EU. The country that was usually one of the EU’s biggest cheerleaders.A disillusion with the EU is spreading across the continent.People are beginning to see that it’s a good thing to have control of your borders.

Some senior EU politicians fear that the virus could kill off the EU altogether. Right now it’s on a ventilator and looking very sorry for itself.We can only hope — for the good of our European friends — that someone switches that ventilator off.Once we all emerge from lockdown there will be a financial price to pay. Our economy — the world’s economy — has taken a hell of a battering.But the good news is that we will be in with a much better chance of a full recovery than the EU bloc.From  you will no longer have to pay tarfs on a vast range of goods imported from beyond Europe.I suspect it will lead to a consumer bonanza — which is just what we want. Washing machines, freezers, women’s sanitary products, bicycle inner tubes, Christmas trees — the list of stuff which will be cheaper is almost endless.It’s true thatthe EU refuses to soften its stance about a trade deal with us, then we’ll pay more for cars made on the continent.But even that might have its upside. It will encourage people to buy British. Last year Brits bought only , cars that had been manufactured in the UK. The majority of cars were bought from German plants. Your loss, Germany.The EU negotiators are still being intransigent. They still think they can bully this country.Michael Gove has told them to get real.

It might be interesting.I’m sure it was a criminal of some kind, but that’s not the point.I wanted to knowmy caller was a member of the mysterious Yaghnobi people, who live in the mountains in the north of the country, with their many goats. That would have been exciting.I might start ringing up numbers in Tajikistan indiscriminately.

It doesn’t fit the media narrative of Sturgeon the superstar. Likewise, Scotland has had far more deaths in care homes than England when adjusted for population.And Sturgeon has an even bigger issue when it comes to Scotland’s anaemic testing operation.The country has a much higher rate of Covid- per head than England and has been carrying out just a quarter of the tests England has per capita. Truly dire.So who has emerged as Sturgeon’s knight in shining armour Her bête noire, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who this week announced anyone in the UK with symptoms can receive a test from the NHS.As for those lockdown-lting measures from Boris that pious Sturgeon used for maximum media impact, including a farcical suggestion from her party to introduce a police border between Scotland and England — knock me down with a feather! — she’s only gone and followed suit a week later.Sturgeon’s behaviour in the midst of a genuine international health emergency has been unseemly.But with enemies in her own party circling over her complete failure to push forward the independence cause, expect to see more desperate stunts in the weeks to come. The media should be wise to her tricks.But maybe BBC bosses are finally listening. Five months after I wrote in this column that axing BBC had been disastrous and BBC should have been cut instead, they are now doing a U-turn to make that very change.Right. Time for a  wishlist then. Can EastEnders and Have I Got News For You be chopped next  Oh, and The Mash Report and Newsnight too.But I’ll take two series of The Apprentice a year instead.APPARENTLY it’s only OK to be gayyou’re a raving Corbynista Remoaner.That’s particularly offensive to yours truly – but the only message to take from the shocking cancellation of the Virtual Pride festival this week.Big names from Dannii Minogue to Andrew Lloyd Webber were due to appear during the ten-hour online extravaganza, organised to replace the ious gay gatherings that are usually held over summer.But then, all of a sudden, the event was axed.The organiser, it was claimed, had committed a cardinal sin.Racism  Nope.Sexism  Definitely not.Breaking draconian lockdown restrictions  Hell no.It turns out that Charlie Shakespeare was actually a Brexit supporter who had – shock horror! – liked tweets by Nigel Farage and The Spectator’s associate editor Toby Young.Corbyn adviser Linda Riley, the publisher of Diva magazine, tweeted: “Any LGBTQ event which supports the likes of these will not have my support. #proudtobeapoliticalbigot.”This sort of persecution of an LGBT ally by the London liberal media elite – simply because he harbours a dferent political view – is a disgrace.Just like any other group in society, the gay community is politically erse.And militant LGBT activists should realise we will only achieve true acceptance by embracing this ersity.As well as being an accurate accolade, it’s an apt choice for the lockdown era. “Couldn’t escapeI wanted to . . . ”WHAT does public le in the UK look like without appearances from the Queen Not a prospect I’ve ever wanted to consider, but one growing more and more likely as the -year-old continues to shelter at Windsor Castle with just a skeleton staff.What a tragedyan unexpected consequence of this ghastly pandemic from China is the greatest British monarch of all-time being forced to remain locked away from her adoring public.While far lesser royals might be able to stay front-of-mind with Zoom calls and ious other stunts filmed on mobile phones, that would be unbecoming of the Queen, who has always picked her moments to emerge in public with decorum and class.The idea of regular TV or other media addresses isn’t right either.There is a reason there have only been a handful over the course of her reign. They really mean something.But as a loyal subject, I concur that the health of Her Majesty – deep into the most vulnerable age group – matters more than anything .In a perfect world, I like to imagine she is enjoying the retirement with the Duke of Edinburgh she probably never thought she would have.“Put the kettle on please, Phil.

Similarly, there could be a small effect due to reductions in air traffic and contrail formation.In both cases though, the sunny weather is really driven by the meteorology – without blocking conditions, we wouldnt have had the sunny weather. We have just been lucky in this case to be in the right place at the right time.Data from the University of Readings weather observatory shows that, by am on May , there had been more than  hours of sunshine since the start of March.The spring has been so sunny that it is almost certain to beat many summers in the sunshine record, despite spring having signicantly fewer hours of daylight.Dr Peter Inness, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, told The : We have seen some record-breaking weather this year already, but for this spring to even rival the sunniest summers on record is quite extraordinary.Stunning aerial pictures have also revealed how Britains seas have turned crystal clear due to the lack of pollution during the lockdown.Photographer Mike Woods, ,  who captured some of stunning pictures using his drone said: There has been a lot of talk about the colour of the water in the area recently and I think the perception is, nature is thriving.Weve never, ever seen the water look this clear before, its lovely. "},{"url":null,"title":"gents urinals scrapped open pubs after pandemic","story":"For more than  years men have been standing up when using the toilets in boozer but thanks to social distancing they are set to become a thing of the past.The idea is in a draft proposal which will be sent to the government by UK Hospitality who are looking at opening up Britains , boozers as quickly and safely as possible.In its paper UK Hospitality said: “As part of your risk assessment, have a plan specically for communicating and controlling access to customer toilets to ensure compliance with physical distancing rules and ensure all staff are aware.“Cleaning regimes for toilet facilities should be more frequent than under normal circumstances and using disinfectants and sanitisers that are effective against bacteria as well as cold and flu viruses.“Examples of other considerations include looking at closing urinals to maintain safe distancing levelspracticable, or installing some form of ider between them.”Although most pub urinals may be seen as bog standard, there are some that are spectacular and even listed as part of Britains heritage.They include The Princess Louise in Holborn, London and the Philharmonic Dining Rooms in Liverpool both of which have spectacular ornate marble facilities.Bob Emms, of West Sussex based Bedlam Brewery, which supplies pubs in the south of England, said: “We would welcome any move that helps pubs reopen sooner in a safe environment. Pubs are looking at all sorts of proposals to keep drinkers safe so they can enjoy a pint.We would like to think a one in one out system for the toilets would work but am not a scientist and the industry will listen to the scientic advice before any decision is made.Bob addedit meant changing toilet layouts and closing urinals to get pubs open again then it would be welcome for business.Boris Johnson has said his aim is to get the multi-billion pound hospitality business open by early July - as part of the Step  proposals - to catch the rest of the summer for an industry that provides jobs for more than five million people and five per cent of the countrys GDP.He gave a glimmer of hope that we might all enjoy a pint when he told the country earlier his month from Downing Street: “At the earliest by July ...we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.“Throughout this period of the next two months we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity.

We keep everything under review and have already proven we will act where necessary.Mr Sunak faced mounting external pressure too yesterday as self-employed bodies warned that failure to extend the scheme in line with the timetable for the furlough scheme would be “a glaring injustice”.Andy Chamberlain from the Association of Independent Professionals said: “The self-employed aren’t just a vital and major part of the workforce: they are also the hard-working entrepreneurs we will need to kickstart the economy after Coronavirus.However, most of them cannot continue their work in the midst of this deadly pandemic and they are relying on government support to keep their businesses afloat.“We were delighted when the government heeded our calls and set up the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, but now it must keep it open as long as the self-employed need it.It must not commit a glaring injustice by extending the employee Job Retention Scheme but pulling the rug from under the self-employed.Maintaining employee support while scrapping self-employed support also risks forcing freelancers back to work in unsafe conditions. It risks forcing them to make an awful choice between their health and their income.”One Tory said Mr Sunak wants to extend the scheme until the end of July but limit access to the grants to self-employed people who can prove they have no other income during that period.He is said to be surprised at how many self-employed people have carried on working while claiming the government grants.The Tory said: No think the figures are so small, so just do it and give the economy a chance to get going again.The compromise will be to extend it to the end of July like the furlough scheme, but the Treasury want conditions - ie no other income during that period.WE understand Rishi Sunak’s fears that the self-employed bailout is ripe for fraud — and his reluctance to extend it.But fair’s fair.The Government cannot shut millions of businesses, then not fully support them.That is a disaster morally, economically and politically.Employees have been seen right.Cut off the cash to self-starters, though, and the lockdown will crumble in minutes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Theyre not out holding tape measures, thats not the polices job to do.The police arent there to enforce social distancing because the law doesnt allow it.

Melendez-Torres of Exeter University, and Alistair Smith of the Department of Education.The Joint Secretary of the National Education Union Dr Mary Bousted claimed the findings showed the plannedwas “too soon”.She said: “We think it’s just descending into chaos now and it’s not funny.“The evidence is still not there, we now have the Independent Sage Committee saying give it two weeks then we’ll have half as much chance of catching the virus.“This is just really confusing for parents, it’s very dficult for school leavers having to make decisions on inadequate scientic evidence.”The documents also support going back to schools, in a blow to the hardline union bosses – who have claimed it could cost lives.The advice will pile pressure on the army of councils rebelling against the date to drop their opposition and let kids back to class.According to a survey of  local authorities in England by The Times, only a small minority were willing to abide by Government advice.Almost two thirds of local authorities responded but only  of them said they would be planning afor June .Another  said they were leaving it up to inidual schools and headteachers and they would not lay out directions.Nine councils said they hadnt yet decided or did not provide a clear response.The documents claim it is no more dangerous for teachers than any other key worker.A whopping . million people – a third of all workers - are ‘key workers’ across the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics.This includes NHS and social care staff, but also an army of other workers including bus and train drivers, supermarket staff, police and some council staff.Hardline unions had drawn up a list of  health and safety demands before teachers go back to class.One of the sticking points is having a robust contact tracing system in place -

including older adults and five to -year-olds - will be included in the second phase of Covid- vaccine trials, to see the effects on their immune system.And the scientists behind it say they are aiming to have at least a million doses of a vaccine by September this year.The first phase of the University of Oxford trial began in April, involving , healthy adults aged  and under.However, the age range of participants has now been expanded to include those aged -, five- and over s.Adults in the trial will receive one or two doses of either the new vaccine - ChAdOx nCoV- - or another licensed vaccine.Researchers will then compare the number of infections in both groups.And this could take between two and to six months, depending on how many people are exposed to the virus.Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology, at the Jenner Institute, told the BBC: We have had a lot of interest already from people over the age of  years who were not eligible to take part in the phase-one study.And we will now be able to include older age groups to continue the vaccine assessment.We will also be including more study sites, in dferent parts of the country.The Oxford researchers are still looking for volunteers to take part in the second phase of the trial.Professor Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said that it is important to see how the vaccine works in older adults given they have a weaker immune response.He told BBC Radio s Today programme on Friday: The next phase is looking at those over  and then a second group who are over -years-of-age.The reason why that is important is because immune responses tend to be less strong, particularly in the over s.We want to study that in great detail in that age group as well as to seethere are any dferences in vaccine safety.Prof Pollard said he was hopeful the vaccine could be ready to be rolled out by this autumn.He said: “It’s a very dficult question to know exactly when we’ll have proof that the vaccine works because we need within our population of , people to have enough of those who have been exposed to the virus over that time.”However, he added: There is uncertainty about how many cases there will be over the next three months.In some ways we hope there wont be very many cases because that would suggest we have great success in managing social distancing and so on and managing the population.Butthere are cases then it is certainly possible by the autumn to have a result. And that’s what we’re hoping for - but its not possible to predict.Despite this, the Government has repeatedly cautioned that there are no guarantees - and a vaccine could still be some way off.And most experts still estimate it will take  to  months to develop and manufacture a vaccine.Trials of the same vaccine on monkeys appear to have given them some protection against the disease.The animals had less of the virus in their lungs and airways, but it is not certain this finding will translate to people.Prof Pollard said: What that trial showed was that the vaccine prevented pneumonia in those animals.That really supports moving forward with the vaccine in humans because actually thats what we really want to know is whether it can prevent pneumonia and severe infection in humans.Experts have said Brits will be the first to get coronavirus vaccineUK make  million successful doses by September.Business Secretary Alok Sharma announced last week that a global licensing deal had been signed between Oxford University and the pharma firm as part of a £million plan to vaccinate half the UK population. The firm will make million doses of the vaccine over timeit proves to prevent the infection - and half of Brits would be in line to get one.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their risk of death or severe infection is extremely low.The balance of risk is strongly toto school.Prof Viner added that it would be important once studentsto school for countries to track transmissions through schools, looking at who both the children and parents have been in contact with.He said: Its reassuring for teachers to know that children are more than  per cent less susceptible to it.He added the importance of collecting data in schools and Prof Chris Bonell highlighted that it was also important that contact between parents at the schools gates was also assessed.The level of contact tracing will be the key thing for opening schools, we will need to knowmeasures are working, but teachers wont have time to be filling out questionnaires to help with this.Earlier this week, teaching union chiefs demanded education bosses provide maps of bins and extra staff to clean pain brushes and glue sticks, before teachers couldto school.The National Education Union, GMB, Unison and Unite produced at least  questions for the Department of Education to answer, and urged their , members not toto work until each is answered.Meanwhile, around , schools could defy the Governments plans to reopen as  councils expressed their concerns.Among those against the plans are Birmingham, Calderdale council in Yorkshire, Solihull, Bristol, Newcastle, Essex and Brighton and Hove.Labour support the Governments plans for children toto school, so long as three tests have been met.They want the scientic advice behind the June  date to be published, track and trace to be in place, and the Government to bring parent groups, teachers and unions together to find a consensus.As part of the study Prof Viners team screened , studies - and identied  which contained useful data.They found children and young people, aged under  years old, had  per cent lower odds of catching Sars-CoV- - which causes Covid- - from an infected person, when compared with adults.The scientists said there was not enough data to determinechildren under  have a dferent risk to teenagers.In addition, while kids appear less likely to catch the virus from others, once infected Prof Viners team remain uncertain about how likely children are to spread coronavirus.Their conclusions do, however, suggest that children have a lesser role in the transmission of the virus at a population level.Thats because kids are signicantly less likely to catch it in the first place.The researchers did note that their findings have not yet been peer reviewed, or published in a journal, as was typical practise with all scientic studies in a pre-coronavirus world.Prof Viner said: It is well known that children and young people make up only a very small percentage of confirmed clinical cases of Covid-, in most countries, including the UK.Children and teenagers make up an even smaller proportion of severe cases or deaths.“However such data about confirmed infection among clinical cases tells us little about susceptibility or transmission – as most children have few,any, symptoms and therefore many do not present for testing or come to the attention of doctors.“To understand susceptibility and transmission it was essential we looked at studies which trace and test all the close contacts of those with infection and at studies which screen whole populations for infections and not just those with symptoms.”Co-author Dr Rosalind Eggo, of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “The available evidence has been brought together in a systematic way to better understand SARS-CoV- infections of children.It suggests that children and young people are at lower risk of infection than adults and may therefore play a smaller role in the epidemic as a whole.This new evidence will help us better understand the possible effect of school reopening on transmission in schools and in the community.This study is co-authored by researchers from UCL, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of Cambridge, University of Exeter, University of Sydney and National Institute for Public Health and the Environment , Bilthoven, The Netherlands.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think they intend it to help to provide trust in what they are saying. And quite rightly so.Basically what we in the scientic community do is give the best advice we can based on the evidence thats available to us.We then pass it to government ministers and the policy parts of government who can then take that and do with it what they like within the policy context.Sir Ian, who was the chief scientic adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from -, said SAGE meetings are currently taking place over Zoom.More than  people sit on SAGE - the UKs top advisory team of elite experts who step in to inform British leadership when making decisions.The names of those in the group were published in early May after officials bowed to mounting pressure to reveal who had been part of regular meetings during the pandemic.The names on the list included well-known figures who have been involved in the daily press conferences, including chairman Sir Patrick Vallance, Professor Chris Whitty and his deputies Dr Jenny Harries and Professor Jonathan Van Tam.Sir Ians claim comes after research this week claimed launching the UKs lockdown a week earlier would have saved tens of thousands of lives.The study, carried out by Dr John Dagpunar, from the University of Southampton, suggested implementing lockdown on March  rather than March  could have limited the number of deaths to ,.Dr Dagpunars study considered the number of people infected with the virus, its rate of reproduction, hospital bed and staff capacity, and the proportion of patients who die, among other factors.And, using an algorithm based on the timing of the UKs outbreak, Dr Dagpunar found thatlockdown had started a week earlier there could have been a very large reduction in deaths.The virus would have infected four per cent less of the population in this scenario , the study said, and the demand for hospital beds would have been lower.Dr Dagpunar said: In hindsight [this] clearly illustrates that earlier action was needed and would have saved many lives.Literally, each day’s delay in starting suppressioncan result in thousands of extra deaths.The same is true for premature relaxation, acknowledging that the rate of decline is less than the rate of growth, so the effect although severe is not quite as strong.These conclusions are the incontrovertible consequence of the exponential growth and decline of a managed epidemic.Dr Dagpunars paper was published on the website medRxiv without being peer-reviewed by other scientists.Around two thirds of people think the Government took too long to put the UK in lockdown, according to polls.However, other experts say ministers lost sight of the evidence and rushed into lockdown, praising Sweden for holding its nerve and not shutting down the economy.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While evidence suggests there is no evidence to back up claims that masks can protect you from becoming infected - experts say they can stop others from contracting the disease.Current advice from the UK government states that you should wear a face covering or maskyou take public transport oryou go to a supermarket. You do not have to wear them when you are exercising.Government advice states: “Face-coverings should not be used by children under the age of two, or those who may find it dficult to manage them correctly, for example, primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions.”As it stands the children ing to school will all be of primary age and the advice would mean that they do not have to wear them.But as inidual schools have rebelled against the governments plans saying they will not open schools, it may be that inidual head teachers and local councils make these decisions for their schools.The government states: Schools and other education or childcare settings should therefore not require staff, children and learners to wear face coverings. Changing habits, cleaning and hygiene are effective measures in controlling the spread of the virus.The coronavirus lockdown has affected everyones normal routine. Many parents are at home with their children all day and for many kids, it might be hard to understand whats going on.This sht in routine has seen many children struggle as they are away from their peers and from their normal lives.But older children, who are more aware of the situation may feel uncomfortable about going back to school.Many children are aware of the virus and the changes around them but its important to talk to your children about what they should expect when ing to schools and what the pandemic means.Dr Lucy Viney from The Fitzrovia Psychology Clinic in London said parents shouldt be afraid to discuss the pandemic with their children.Your goal is to help your child feel informed and get fact-based information that is likely to be more reassuring than whatever they’re hearing from their friends or on the news.. Do not be afraid to discuss the coronavirus with your child: Your goal is to help your child feel informed and get fact-based information that is likely to be more reassuring than whatever they’re hearing from their friends or on the news.. Allow your child space to share their worries and fears: For example, you could say: “I understand that all these changes are making you feel worried. It’s OK to feel worried when everything seems dferent. I’m so pleased you have let me know how you’re feeling”.. Identy non-verbal opportunities for emotional expression: For example, it can be helpful to draw pictures of things that your child has noticed each day or to ask them to choose some music to listen to together that reflects how they are feeling.. Focus on what you’re doing to stay safe and healthy, such as hand-washing: This is empowering for children because it gives them tools and knowledge to help keep themselves and others safe, and something that they can focus on.. Establish a daily routine: It can be helpful to integrate activities that you used to do before the coronavirus outbreak, such as eating together, watching a TV show or going to for an evening walk.. Find regular opportunities for meaningful conversations: If possible, try to find an opportunity each day to spend between - minutes of ‘special time’ with each of your children. The basic premises of ‘special time’ are that you specy theof timeand the location, and your child chooses the activity.   This ‘special time’ should be free from any external distractions, such as phone calls.. Look after your mental wellbeing too: Practice self-care and invest in your own wellbeing. It’s important to remember that you can only do what you can manage at this time and that every day doesn’t have to be ‘perfect’.Dr Lucy added that you need to allow your child space and time to reflect on how they are feeling.For example, you could say: I understand that all these changes are making you feel worried. It’s OK to feel worried when everything seems dferent. I’m so pleased you have let me know how you’re feeling.She added that you should also make sure your child is aware of the ious hygiene principles such as hand washing and social distancing,they see you actively doing these activities they will be more inclined to do them for themselves.During this time its easy to think you are being over protective of your childrenyou dont want to send them back to school.But youre not alone, as a recent survey suggested that parents do not want lockdown to be lted until September, meaning many dont want their kids to go back until the next school year.Two in three parents believe lockdown should stay in place until at least June, with . per cent saying the lockdown should remain until September, according to a UK-wide poll of , parents led by learner provider, Exemplar Education.Its important that you address these worries and each parent should assess their situation inidually, whats right for you might not always be right for your friends and neighbours.Dr Lucy highlighted that its important for parents to make sure their own mental health needs are catered for during this time.This is while Steve O’Hara, director of education for Exemplar Education said: “The Covid- pandemic has had an unbelievable impact on the day to day lives of families everywhere. Parents and children are in unfamiliar territory and trying their very best to face the challenges that learning from home brings.It’s vital for parents to be able to talk freely about these challenges and to take care of their own mental wellbeing over the course of the lockdown. Sharing worries will help all of us feel less stress and concerned and help us take some of the pressure off.”One big concern during this time is that children would miss out on vital education.While many schools have provided home schooling resources, some households may not be able to access them, while other parents may not feel comfortable home schooling their kids.As many as . per cent of parents reported dficulties in supporting their children with learning from home. In a clear sign that many parents nationwide are feeling the strain a further . per cent said they do not feel equipped to support their children’s learning.Mr OHara added: Many are extremely concerned about lockdown coming to an end too suddenly, yet are anxious about their children’s learning and their own personal ability to support them at home.While some children will be missing out on the education aspect of the lockdown, others will also be struggling in the constrained social environment.The education secretary earlier this month warned of dire consequences to learningchildren did notto school.Gavin Williamson said that children stand to lose more by staying away from schools.Reassuring parents that schools would be made safe he said: School staff can already be tested for the virus, but from the first of June well extend that to cover children and their familiesany of them develop symptoms.This is while Labours Rebecca Long-Bailey this week said that children in older age groups should not be forced to catch up on what they have missed out on during the lockdown period.Speaking to TES she said: “What we are going to see when we get back to the classroom is those students who are in families where their parents are lucky enough be able to afford tutors, or those who can hothouse, will catch up very quickly.And everybody  won’t be able to do that, and then you’ve got a whole generation of pupils who could fall through the cracks and their prospects will be affected and they won’t be able to get jobs in the future.”During the lockdown, many nurseries, like schools have remained open to support parents of children who are key workers.Many have been running at a limited capacity, but workers are still generally having the same amount of contact with children as they did before.Busy Bees – which has  centres across the UK and Ireland – has confirmed its health and safety plans will not include those stringent measures.Kids will be able to play in smaller groups and teachers will work on iding children into close friendship groups to limit the number of people they come into contact with.They will also reduce the space that children can explore and increase the time they spend outdoors.Playdough, sandpits and water games will be banned in a bid to prevent the killer bug from spreading around nurseries.All children and staff will have their temperature checked upon arrival, and those families waiting to enter the nursery will be asked to wait two metres apart at drop off and pick up.Regular temperature checks for both children and team members will continue throughout the day, as will frequent handwashing and disinfecting of communal areas. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You could point the finger at scientists for not actually being explicit enough. But at the end of the day all these interact with public opinion as well. And I think some politicians would have loved to have reacted earlier but in their political opinion it probably wasnapost feasible because people wouldnapost have perhaps responded in the way they eventually did. Sir Ian also said that he believes the statement we are guided by the science is slightly misleading. He explained: I donapost think ministers intend it to be misleading. I think they intend it to help to provide trust in what they are saying. And quite rightly so. Basically what we in the scientic community do is give the best advice we can based on the evidence thataposs available to us.

The new plan, due to take effect from June , will see people asked to stay indoors for  daystheyaposve been identied as having been in close contact with someone who is infected. But itaposs unclearthe self-isolation will be enforced, as Health Secretary Matt Hancock appealed to Britons to do their bit to help prevent a second peak of the virus as lockdown measures are eased. Writing for the Evening Standard, Mr Hancock said: Everyone will have a part to play. Not just hygiene and social distancing, but getting a testyou have symptoms and under the new system, self-isolatingyouaposve been in close contact with someone who tests positive. That way, under test and trace, people who have been in contact with a positive case and are at higher risk can isolate, and we can ease more measures on everyone . The governmentaposs first attempt at testing and contact tracing was stopped in mid-March due to the sheer scale of cases in the UK, a senior Public Health England  official said today.Professor Yvonne Doyle, PHEaposs medical director, told the Commons Science and Technology Committee that many hundreds of thousands of people had been exposed to coronavirus by the time testing and tracing was stopped around March .The Governmentaposs testing coordinator Professor John Newton, who is also PHEaposs director of health improvement, said the testing plans were abandoned after a million cases of Covid- were predicted across the UK. Their comments contrast with those from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who has defended leaving care home guidance in place until March  that said the risk of infection across care homes was low. On Tuesday, Mr Hancock told the Commons that community transmission of coronavirus in the UK in early to mid-March was low. Prof Doyle told MPs the policy decision was to very much focus on the NHS in terms of testing and that, given the testing resources available, a decision was taken to stop more widespread community testing and tracing. She said it was stopped in March because of the sheer scale of cases in the UK, which had been introduced by multiple introductions, particularly after half-term, and from European countries we now know had large amounts of prevalence themselves. She added: So we have multiple introductions, with many hundreds of thousands of people by March who had now been exposed to this virus in this country. Contact tracing could not possibly have had the capacity to address that. And with the capacity of lab testing and our contact tracers, we felt the most important thing to do was to focus on where there was national concern, which was the capacity of the NHS, to accrue that testing. Prof Doyle told MPs the organisation did not reject the South Korean model of mass coronavirus testing, and had in fact followed a similar path until March. We did not reject the South Korean model, in fact we were very interested in what was happening internationally from the get-go. The testing capacity and testing profile of PHEaposs approach in the contain phase - which is between January and March - was very close to the one of South Korea for quite a long time, into early March.  Prof Newton said there had been a discussion in the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieswhich established that it would not be worthwhile to continue contact tracing once community transmission took hold in the UK. He said the decision in March to abandon it was made by Government informed by all its advisers, not just PHE. When in March it became apparent that community transmission was occurring and we had multiple injections, introductions from dferent countries in the UK, that decision was then enacted, Prof Newton told MPs. It was a decision of course of Government, informed by all its advisers, not just Public Health England. He added: The epidemiology was crucial, we had an increase in the number of cases in March. The advice from modellers was that within a short period we would expect to be having a million cases in the UK, and of courseyou have a million cases thereaposs no way, however much contact tracing or testing capacity you have, that you can pursue the South Korea model. At that point, the Government made the decision to move to lockdown as the most appropriate response to the epidemiology in the UK at the time. Downing Street said the decision to move away from contact tracing in mid-March was taken by the Governmentaposs experts. Askedit was a decision by ministers, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: It was set out at the time by the Government experts who were attending the daily press conference why they had reached the decision to start focusing their testing on people who were sick in hospital. Thataposs how I remember the decision making process.

He wrote: “The absence again of any secondary guidance on what is expected regarding Years  and  ‘face-to-face’ experience was discussed by our Executive Committee today. “Further discussion with the Department for Education this afternoon leads us to advise you to rule out any students in those year groups ing immediately after half-term.” In a video message to accompany the email, Mr Barton said: “We shouldn’t be rushing into anything at all, and therefore we shouldn’t be expecting that we are going to have year  and year  pupils in. “And in fact, I don’t think the Department [for Education] are expecting that you would have those pupils into school from June .” In his email, he added: “Bear in mind that this is an issue of public health – wanting to ensure that groups of students are not mixing widely in the community. “Great caution is therefore necessary, and we would recommend waiting until after half-term to see what the government has finally proposed, and then we will respond. “There’s some feeling that theby any but a small handful of secondary students may now look unlikely during the summer term. He urged heads to proceed with caution and feel under no pressure for June  to be anything other than one where a partial and controlled wider opening may start to happen. He went on to say a rota system - where small numbers of pupilsfor a day or week at a time - will continue to apply from September onwards. He added: Business as usual for our schools and colleges is a long way off.

Professor Newton also urged the public not to buy off-the-shelf DIY antibody tests. He told the Commons Science and Technology Committee the public should wait for approved home tests which are currently being trialled.

The trade group has put forward the potential guidelines after consulting with multiple industry leaders, while other proposals include no drinking at the bar and introducing smoking area patrols.The document said: “As part of your risk assessment, have a plan specically for communicating and controlling access to customer toilets to ensure compliance with physical distancing rules and ensure all staff are aware. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. “Cleaning regimes for toilet facilities should be more frequent than under normal circumstances and using disinfectants and sanitisers that are effective against bacteria as well as cold and flu viruses. “Examples of other considerations include looking at closing urinals to maintain safe distancing levelspracticable, or installing some form of ider between them.”Earlier this month, Boris Johnson said some hospitality firms could be able to reopen from July  at the earliest in the Governmentaposs third phase of the lockdown. Pubs, restaurants and hotels have remained closed since shutting their doors in March, with vast numbers of staff supported by the Governmentaposs furlough scheme. In the draft guidance, hospitality businesses claried that they do not wish to move ahead with reopening before the time is right and support a phased reopening approach. The proposals for restaurants suggest that condiments would not be left on tables, with inidually wrapped sauces and condiments handed out by staff on request. Restaurants would also need to bring cutlery with customersapos food, rather than leave them on tables or allow customers to help themselves. Tables would also be spaced in the restaurant to meet social distancing guidelines. Meanwhile, the guidance suggests that restrictions on customers remaining at the bar after ordering and getting their drink should be considered.

Mum Claire Hardwick has issued a warning after three-month-old daughter Lottie developed painful burns and blisters across her face when sister Lexi, eight, unknowingly put the poisonous plant Giant Hogweed in her buggy on Saturday. Within less than  hours, the youngster was covered in aposred rawapos welts her parents initially thought were sunburn and she was rushed to AE, where she spent a night before being transferred to a specialist burns unit at a childrenaposs hospital nearly  miles away. Mum-of-five Claire, from Lancaster, Lancs, is now speaking out to raise awareness of the dangers of the seemingly innocuous plant, which causes reactions when it comes into contact with human skin because its sap is full of toxic chemicals. The stay-at-home mum, , said: This plant looks so pretty, but it is lethal. Please, do not let your kids pick it. I did not have a clue a plant could do that to your skin, and such a nice-looking plant as well - who would have thought it could be so dangerous  I felt so guilty when I realised what had caused Lottieaposs burns - itaposs every mumaposs worst nightmare. Lexi is old enough to understand and feels awful too, because she knows she put the flowers there. Claire and husband Michael, , a cleaner, were walking down a cycle path with their children to visit the grave of their daughter Layla, who was stillborn last year, when Lexi picked the Hogweed, which has distinctive white flowers, to lay next to the plaque. The eight-year-old placed the flowers at the feet of Lottieaposs car seat buggy chair but the tot must have touched them with her hand and then rubbed her face. By pm, four hours after the family got home from their walk, Lottieaposs face had begun to redden and by .am the next morning, large blisters had formed on her cheeks.  The concerned couple rushed their youngest child to AE at Lancaster Infirmary, where doctors popped and wiped the blisters, initially believing them to be severe sunburn. Nurses then realised Giant Hogweed was the cause of the burns after telling Claire to Google the plant and see whether that was what Lexi had picked. Lottie spent a night on a childrenaposs ward before being sent to a burns unit at Royal Manchester Childrenaposs Hospital the next day for further treatment before being allowed tohome. Claire said: We lost our daughter a year ago, so we were going to visit her and Lexi picked some flowers to take to the grave. She placed them at the side of Lottie in the car seat, near her legs, but we think she put her hand on it and rubbed her face.  By the time we got home her face was getting redder and redder. I thought it must be sunburn and felt so guilty, but it wasnapost sunny at all. By the next morning the blisters were red raw and her eyes were so puffy she couldnapost open them - her eyelids were three times the size they normally are. We were terried - we had no idea what was wrong. Giant Hogweed causes such horric burns because the plantaposs sap contains chemicals which react with light while in contact with the skin. Blisters usually form within  hours and in severe cases it can cause permanent scarring and even blindness.  Medics have not yet been able to tell Claire and Michael whether Lottie will suffer any permanent scarring as a result of her injuries. Claire said: Hopefully, Lottie wonapost be scarred for le but the doctors arenapost certain yet. They think the reaction was so much worse because sheaposs so young, so her skin is still very delicate. I want to raise awareness, because no one knows how dangerous this plant can be. Anyone who believes they have come into contact with the plant should wash their skin with soap and water and avoid direct sunlight for  hours.

The study, which observed over , people hospitalized with COVID-, showed that people treated with the drug, or the closely related drug chloroquine, had higher risk of death when compared to those who had not been given the medicine. Demand for hydroxychloroquine, a drug approved decades ago, surged after Trump touted its use as a coronavirus treatment in early April.

Troy House in Monmouth originates from the th century and the Grade II listed four storey dream home comes complete with a theatre, chapel and two tennis courts. It was built for the family of the Duke of Beaufort, adding to an imposing portfolio of properties which also included Great Castle House in Monmouth and Badminton House in Gloucestershire.The estate was later converted into a convent school and then became a school, but as the condition of the buildings deteriorated the school moved locations in the s and the once grand manor has been left to rot. The , square-foot property has now been put up for auction, with a guide price of between £, and £, - but a look inside at just how dilapidated it has become suggests youaposll need far deeper pockets toit to its former glory. Listed by Allsop, it provides  bedrooms, four dormitories, a principalaposs flat, a staff flat, a caretakeraposs flat, a two storey hostel block, outbuildings and garages. The picturesque setting and grand exterior belie the true scale of the renovation job required, with photos of the interior showing floorboards and structures rotten through, with a huge clearance job needed to clear the abandoned school furniture. The description reads: The property is presented in a poor state of repair and requires extensive works of modernisation and refurbishment. The property may afford possible potential for redevelopment and or a number of alternative uses, subject to obtaining all necessary consents.If youaposre able to look beyond the current state of repair, the ultimate do-er upper does come with some incredible benefits, including sprawling land, original fittings and an estate that wouldnapost look out of place on Downton Abbey.

With the Brecon Beacons National Park to the west and River Wye is to the east, you wonapost be short of idyllic viewsyou want a bit of a break from the DIY. Richard Adamson, partner and auctioneer at Allsop, said: Troy House has received a signicant amount of interest with over  enquiries regarding the property, in just over a week of coming to the market. We have seen a mixed-bag of interest from people who could use the property for multiple uses including as a private home, converting into a boutique hotel and spa, or refurbished into luxury apartments, subject to planning.

However, thanks to a  a close Vladimir Putin political ally - Nadia will not not lose her job over the raunchy outfit Although she said the “glory” of her new-found fame was “hard to endure”, she told her local newspaper Tulskaya Pressa. Nadia had earlier explained to her managers she was “too hot” in her protective gown and clothes but doctors in Tula Regional Clinical Hospital have now revealed there were shortages of both disposable and reusable medical clothing to wear over her lingerie. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here The nurse told the newspaper she had to close all her social media over the furore which led regional health chiefs to announce she was being disciplined for “non-compliance with the requirements for medical clothing”. This came after she had been forced to stay apart from her family for two months while she cares for coronavirus patients, so as not to put her relatives at risk, she said. “Iaposm not scared - itaposs my job,” she was quoted as saying. “I always wanted to help people, bring benefits, so I went into medicine.” The head of her hospital Dr Anna Savishcheva insisted Nadia had not been punished over the pictures. And she revealed the nurse had received a personal visit and backing from Tula regional governor Alexey Dyumin, , a former Putin bodyguard and military spy chief who has been tipped as a future Russian president.  We did not impose any disciplinary sanctions, in any case, written,” Dr Savishcheva told Vesti Tula TV. “The girl continues to work. “This is a good employee, a professional, who provides medical care at a high level.” She said: “As soon as her picture appeared in web, governor Alexey Dyumin met her - and was in touch with her. “He chatted, supported and thanked her and all the medics for their work. Nadia did not deserve reproach for her appearance, said the hospital chief. The nurse did her job, she did not pose.” Nadia is believed to be not the only medic to wear only underwear beneath their transparent protective gowns.  We just have nothing to wear,” a doctor told Komsomolskaya Pravda. “There are not enough scrub suits, which according to the rules we should wear under our protective gowns…. Believe me, we wouldn’t go nakedwe were provided with a complete set.” A doctor on the same ward as Nadia said: I totally support the nurse. “It very hot in these costumes for a long time. “She did not deserve any punishment. “Most likely she realised that the costume was transparent, but decided to dress like this anyway because it is very hard to be in these costumes for a long time.

It was loved by the poet Lord Tennyson and, at low tide, it stretches almost to the horizon. It’s the eve of the late May Bank Holiday, the start of half-term, and Britain is baking under soaring temperatures. Yet the fairground is silent, the crazy golf is empty and there are no donkey rides along the sands. The local council has begged people to stay away, but by yesterday the beaches were filling up with visitors desperate to let their kids play in the sand. Nowhere is the terrible bind of this moment played out more than in Mablethorpe and its close neighbour Skegness, strung out along the same Lincolnshire coast. These towns desperately need visitors, yet also need them to stay away.  They are the two towns in the UK that economists project will be worst hit by economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.In communities where ‘summer pays for winter’, every day the towns remain closed, they are dying. Yet an influx of visitors would threaten the lives of thousands of local elderly people and lead to a second mid-season peak that could finish off coastal towns for good. Allison Stapleton and her husband Colin own Monty’s fish and chip shop in Mablethorpe. They sum up the dilemma. “At the end of the day our health is more important than a bag of chips,” Allison , says. “Butwe don’t get up and running soon, we will not survive the winter months and % of the Mablethorpe coast will not get through the winter.” The £, government grant they received is quickly being swallowed by rent and bills. “At the moment we have only opened the takeaway part of the shop for two days, Friday and Saturday,” Allison says.  “I usually hug some of our elderly ladies, and it was heartbreaking not to be able to when they came in.” For Daniel Goate, , who runs Poplar Farm Restaurant and Caravan Park on a few acres of the Lincolnshire Wolds in Skegness, the situation is even more acute. “The longer we are closed, the more money we are losing,” he says. “We are a seasonal business, but there’s no guarantee we can open this season, or next.” Even so – in contrast to some millionaires’ luxury businesses – he said Poplar Farm was hoping not to furlough anyone “to take the pressure off government”. In town, Sue Allen’s shop, Sue’s Curios and Collectables, a fixture in Mablethorpe since , has had to close its museum, but is just about surviving on internet orders.  This coast was struggling long before coronavirus, Mablethorpe being one of the towns Beeching cut off from the rail network in . Last year, a report from the End Child Poverty Coalition found child poverty running at % in several wards in Mablethorpe and Skegness. Last year, Skeggy was cruelly taunted as worse than North Korea by one travel website, and voted Britain’s fourth worst holiday destination by Which , infuriating locals. Now, the strain is visible. ­The ­Furnichurch charity supplies furniture to people in need and runs a food larder that has been delivering desperately needed parcels. In April last year it helped  people. This April that figure was . One of those was a single mum with four children who worked in a care home.  A patient of hers had died from coronavirus,” Dot McMillan, , the charity’s chairman, says. “She then had some symptoms which meant she had to self-isolate. The workplace only paid her for one week.Another man had lost his job and was waiting on his Universal Credit payments. At the same time, he was taking his we to hospital for chemo.The couple waited until their fridge was empty before they came to us for help.Dot says this coming week of hot weather in half-term will be a “real test” for Mablethorpe. “Many of the local people here are worried about seeing an influx because we have all been very good at social distancing,” she says.“I think the Government advice should have been to tell people to stay at home another three weeks.” The Centre for Towns and the University of Southampton came up with their list of worst affected places after calculating the proportion of each town’s population employed in industries temporarily shut down by Covid-. They ranked Mablethorpe first, then Skegness, Clacton-on-Sea, Bridlington and Kinmel Bay, near Rhyl. All are coastal towns already struggling – and all have a Conservative MP.

Baby Emily, now seven months, was born safe and well in October weighing a healthy lbs oz.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email. Lyndsey, from Telford, Shropshire, said: The bracelet saved my babyaposs le. I definitely credit it for ensuring she made it safely in the world because I was worried something was going to go wrong. It gave me the confidence to go to the doctors with my concerns because I had proof from the bracelet and could tell them exactly how many times sheaposd moved. It was great having that reassurance and to know I wasnapost wasting the doctorsapos time.  Itaposs incredible that something as simple as a bracelet could do all that. Primary school teacher Lyndsey, who is also mum to six-year-old Chloe Thompson, had previously used a phone app to track movements but found the bracelet more practical as she was able to wear it and easily log on the go. Lyndsey, married to -year-old engineer Christopher Thompson, used a prototype of the Aska Maternity Movement Bracelet. The bracelet features a small loop and charm that the wearer slips across each bead on the bracelet every time the baby moves. Lyndsey said: When I was pregnant with my first I tried a phone app to track movements but obviously you canapost have a phone at school. I was so busy even at lunchtime and by the time I got to the end of the day I wouldnapost be able to remember what movements Iaposve had. At my -week scan my midwe offered me a bracelet that was being used in trials as Iaposd mentioned reduced movement in my first pregnancy. Having the bracelet reassured me that Iaposd had a certain number of movements.  The bracelet helpedI felt movement while I was teaching, I might be sat with a group of children and could just put my hand on the bracelet and move it across. I would also show the children the bracelet and involve them too, which was nice. Lyndsey had already faced numerous complications in the pregnancy including respiratory problems due to her severe asthma and having to be put on antibiotics throughout after catching sickness bugs. But when Lyndsey said she noticed Emilyaposs movements started to slow down at  weeks, concerned doctors took growth scans every few weeks to monitor her progress.  NHS guidance states thatmums-to-be notice their baby is moving less than usual, or thereaposs a change in the pattern of movements, it may be the first sign their baby is unwell. The NHS also urges mums-to-be to contact a midwe or local maternity unit immediatelythe babyaposs movements have slowed down so their wellbeing can be assessed. Lyndsey said: As the weeks went on, past the -week point, I felt the movements were getting less and less. After having a growth scan they said she was slightly on the low side and to monitor them as time passed.When Lyndsey noticed she wasnapost moving the bracelet charm as often due to reduced movement a week before her due date, she decided to go to hospital. Princess Royal Hospital in Telford. Doctors at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford examined Lyndsey, monitored the babyaposs heart and decided to induce her due to the numerous issues sheaposd faced in the pregnancy. Lyndsey said: I would normally have between six and eight movements a day, when I was only having three and it was later in the day I decided to get it checked out. Directly off the back of me saying she hasnapost moved as much as she should have done they put the bands round and monitored her heart rate.

The Duke said: “I’m worried as to how the young people are going to cope long term because we’re all muddling through this period at the moment and helping each other.” Consultant psychiatrist Frances Doherty, who runs an inpatient mental health unit for teenagers, replied: “What I think has been really helpful is a lot of work has been done to think about how young people can care for themselves, how parents can care for them, to help them to survive and to thrive even… through the pandemic.  “But I think it’s the other side of it that we’ll have all the challenges.” Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales has backed a virtual book of remembrance for Covid- victims allowing families to express their “loss and sorrow” but celebrate “everything good” about their loved ones.

You never know, we may even have cup draws coming soon!I must say, however, I feel the SPFL’s stated aim of kicking off the new campaign at that time –August  for league football – is hopeful rather than one they expect to pull off. There is a whole lot of work to be done to prove to the government football matches can be staged safely.Now, the Premiership clubs have given themselves some space to think about how to restart football with a new campaign.It’s the only sensible option.Clubs now know what ision they are going to be in and there can be some tentative plans put in place to move forward.That’s a step in the right direction.Dundee now know they’ll have to fend off Heartsthey want to win the Championship and can budget for the year ahead knowing who they will be playing.Whether there are fans in attendance, we’ll have to wait and see.The good thing is, it feels like our game is finally moving forward.The past couple of weeks have seen both Dundee and Dundee United start to reshape their squads for next season.Neither are yet in a position to start signing new players, of course, but there are some hints of what is to come at both clubs.United released a few boys at the end of their contracts – Paul Watson, Rakish Bingham and Osman Sow among them.It’s not a clearout or anything but I think we should expect a number of new faces at Tannadice once some sort of normality reappears.With Watson going, they evidently have a new centre-back in mind.I’d expect them to strengthen the spine of the team, adding a central midfielder and a striker to compete with Lawrence Shankland and Nicky Clark.At Dundee, I only expect a handful of new faces.A striker to partner Kane Hemmings is a certainty while maybe another wide attacker and central midfielder will arrive.What happens with Christophe Berra we will have to wait and see. Hearts might not be too happy with Dundee right now#IT was refreshing to see a bit of live football on the TV over the weekend with the Bundesliga kicking off again.It might not have been what we are used to with no fans, masked subs and someDortmund#s Erling Haaland showing a pandemic still can’t stop him.Germany is leading the way on how to get the game back – problem is I don’t see any other country being able to do it as safely as the Germans.I’M no basketball fan but watching the Last Dance on Netflix certainly made me think about becoming one!Remarkable series on the s Chicago Bulls and the great Michael Jordan.Get it watched!SPFL call   Premiership season with Celtic crowned champions, Hearts relegated and St Johnstone landing top-six finish\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp spfl-premiership-celtic-hearts-st-johnstone embed # secretjwBrECgV\" data-secret\"jwBrECgV\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.50137881-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.50137881-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.50137881-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.50137881-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"rakish bingham dundee united release","story":"Rakish Bingham has spoken of his #surprise# over his Dundee United departure but vowed to bounce back.Bingham had impressed after joining the Tangerines on a short-term deal back in February as he chased of a longer contract to fulfil his dream of starring in the Premiership next season.Yet the -year-old former Wigan, Falkirk and Doncaster winger had his hopes dashed when he was recently released by the newly-promoted Premiership outfit as they prepare for their much-anticipatedto the top-flight.Bingham said: #I was a bit surprised to be honest.#I thought I#d done quite well and the feeling I had wasn#t that I was going to be let go.#I can#t speak for the club with everything that#s going on in terms of budget, and that#s obviously part of the reason this has happened.#But I just have to take it on the chin and see what#s out there for the next step in my career.#Bingham savoured his time on Tayside with Robbie Neilson#s men and hopes they can hold their own in the top tier of Scottish Football next season.He added: #It was good at United.

That came with growing prosperity with the rise of women going back to work.More disposable income meant more freedom and iniduality. This was the era of twinsets, waistlines and big skirts and the rise of “ready to wear” fashion.Mary said: “St Nicholas Street developed into a retail mecca with numerous tailors and fashion shops. The creation of what would become known as ready-to-wear fashion could be found in the Esslemont and MacIntosh on Union Street.“This grand and glamorous shopping institution had a popular fragrance and cosmetics hall and was much-loved by style mavens who could source ladylike prom apparel, and later, the beatnik ‘sweater girl’ fashions of the day.”Typical of Aberdeen, men were quick to be at the forefront of fashion, too.“For men, Claude Alexander carried the sharp tailoring that would go on to define the Mod and rockabilly movements. Reid and Pearson drapery on George Street was also a popular shopping destination and had a ballroom on the top floor as well as a portrait photographer, Jerome’s, next door,” said Mary.And the s was the dawn of denim – ubiquitous for every teenager of the day.This was the era where the world moved from monochrome to technicolour and fashion along with it.The Swinging s saw hemlines soar ever higher, hairstyles become even shorter and the time when hotpants became a thing and Mary Quant ruled supreme.“The Cha Girl store on Union Bridge was the place to buy the ubiquitous styles worn by the likes of Twiggy,” said Mary.“Falconers department store, was also on Union Street and although taken over by House of Fraser in  it continued to trade as Falconers until . The store’s two straplines were ‘Symbolising Distinction’ and selling ‘everything a woman could desire’, with collections that reflected the swinging sixties including mini skirts, hot pants and coloured hosiery.”Meanwhile, Isaac Benzie on George Street offered stylish millinery, a hair and beauty salon where short bobbed haircuts a-la-Mary Quant were de-rigeur, as well as a well-appointed tea room.This was an era of two halves – opening under the influence of flower power, closing to the clash of punk then the New Romantics.In between there were flares,  shoes, vibrant shirts for men and the buttoned-down Mod look that had evolved out of the s.At the start of the decade though, it was Aberdeen’s Bill Gibb who reigned supreme.Mary said: “Gibb was Britain’s equivalent of Yves Saint Laurent and his creations helped make London the global fashion capital in the s. With designs that were exotic, romantic and delicate, drawing on Aberdeenshire nature as his inspiration, Gibb’s iconic collections were worn by the most stylish stars of the era including Elizabeth Taylor, Bianca Jagger, Twiggy and Joan Collins.”She added that Dfused versions of Bill Gibb’s influential designs could be found on the high street, particularly in Cha Girl, the UK’s first fashion boutique which is now River Island.“Jeans Fashion Corner on St Nicholas Street catered for the wide-legged hippy denim trends of the day while John Collier with its ‘Window to Watch’ was the destination for Aberdonian men seeking tailoring and psychedelic prints,” said Mary.“Vogue on the corner of Flourmill Lane, which evolved into Just Pants Plus and Dream Merchants on Windmill Brae were also popular independent stores, while Pat’s Boutique on Willowbank Road was one of the city’s coolest. Freeman Hardy Willis on Union Street catered for shoe lovers.”By the end of the era Vivienne Westwood was the doyenne of the punk movement, making safety pins and dog collars must-have times for every young rebel.This was the decade that embraced all things bold and bright  # neon, slogan tees, puffball skirts, big shoulders and even bigger hair!It was a heady mix that the film world played into with floaty skirts for girls courtesy of Dirty Dancing and red braces for some blokes, thanks to the film Wall Street.“Through the s Beaujangles boutique in McCombie#s Court and Jean Genie on George Street reflected more new wave and dance-influenced fashion, flavours of which were worn by some of Aberdeen’s musical exports from Annie Lennox to APB to The Shamen,” said Mary, with Robert Rae and Simpson’s Sports evoking fond memories for many Aberdonians, too.“This was the the most eclectic decade in fashion. Watt and Grant on Union Street was arguably Aberdeen’s most upmarket and expensive department store. Benson’s, Café Ici and Cousins were favourite haunts for Aberdeen’s style set before hitting the dancefloor at Ritzy’s on Bridge Place.”The s saw a step change in style with the arrival of rave culture, according to Mary.It also saw the advent of what became known  as “terrace” fashion casual designer wear that bridged match day and the dancefloor.Popular brands of the time included Chipie, Chevignon, Kappa, Verte Valle, Farah, John Richmond, Adidas, Pringle and Lyle  Scott.Mary said: “Many of these could be found at Kafka and also Signature in Aberdeen. Grunge was the other major global movement of the s with bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden pressing the anti-fashion reset button.“Hip hop was also breaking into the mainstream, igniting the streetwear revolution that would come to dominate subsequent decades.”The arrival of the noughties saw boho-chic as the new trend, essentially print, colour, texture .Mary said: “It was hippy-lite dressing for those who missed the s the first time around.”This was also the era that saw explosion of top designers working with High Street retailers.Mary said: “HM generated mass hysteria with affordable superstar lines from Karl Lagerfeld, Mathew Williamson and Stella McCartney.#Topshop enlisted Christopher Kane and Debenhams partnered with Ben de Lisi, Jasper Conran, Henry Holland and Jonathan Saunders.”Aberdeen’s three-time winner of Scottish Hairdresser of the Year, Ishoka, was the go-to salon for cutting edge hair design and Fever nightclub played out the house music soundtrack that would define a generation.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/03/5abf52ff0483b-919x564.jpg ","title":"lockdown exit strategy provides glimmer of hope for north east pub bosses","story":"The planned reopening of beer gardens and outdoor seating areas in the hospitality sector has been described as a #glimmer of hope# for pubs # although hoteliers are seeking further guidelines on operational limitations.The Scottish Government unveiled a phased lockdown exit strategy which will see bars across Aberdeen and the wider north-east allowed to open beer gardens and outdoor areas.That move is part of phase two in the four phase plan.Paul Clarkson, operations director at PB Devco, which owns a string of bars across the city, including Soul on Union Street, welcomed the news.He said: “It’s definitely a glimmer of hope that we’re starting to turn the tide and hopefully try and come out of this crisis.#“I’ve stayed in touch with the general managers of all the venues, we just had a Zoom chat the other day. We’re very keen to get our tape measures out and work out floor plans and see what we can do.“It’s absolutely welcome news.

Those that have outdoor space will have to weigh up the costs of reopening at a time when their income will be restricted but the requirements around staffing will be proportionally increased.“However, we should remember that most city centre hotels, by the nature of their location, have no outdoor space, so this will mean that they will have to wait until phase three for any income.“There still seems to be, at this stage, a lack of clarity around events and when hotels will be able to begin holding events such as dinners, weddings and conferences again.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53653216-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53653216-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53653216-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53653216-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"number of positive coronavirus cases in north east increases to 1223","story":"More than , people have now died in Scotland due to coronavirus, with five new cases confirmed in the north-east.The latest Scottish Government figures also show the total number of confirmed Covid- cases across Grampian have increased to ,.There are  people in hospital in the region, with  in intensive care.The latest Scottish Government figures also show the total number of confirmed Covid- deaths across Scotland is ,, up from , yesterday.Around , people in Scotland have now been tested for the virus, with the total number of confirmed cases sitting at ,.The Greater Glasgow and Clyde area has the highest number of cases in Scotland with ,.The Evening Express is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Evening Express from just £. a month."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53283200-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53283200-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53283200-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53283200-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"morrice set to be assistant to next coach","story":"Gordonians are the latest club in the Aberdeen area to be seeking the services of a head coach.they join Aberdeenshire, Aberdeen Wanderers and Garioch in the hunt for someone with the necessary experience and know-how.The only dference with the Countesswells side is they are set to announce a replacement for Ryan Morrice next week.And even better for the National League  outfit is the news that the popular, highly-respected Morrice, , will be moving into the assistant coach role.He said: “I informed the club in September of my intentions to step aside in order to concentrate on the Open University course on sports management I am studying, giving them time to replace me.“I have enjoyed my five years which have generally been successful, watching a young squad grow, rather like the glory years at Ellon in my playing days.“I look forward to still being part of the coaching team, this despite the coronavirus scare which is likely to impact on the players in terms of job prospects in the area.“But we’ll see it through together.”Club president Jim Sugden welcomed the news Morrice was staying on.“Effectively we are strengthening the coaching team,” he said.“Not many teams can boast having an assistant coach with the track record of Mo.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 11 coronavirus and the masters","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

There were, however, large sections of the stages still swathed in snow and ice, making conditions changeable to say the least.Lochgilphead#s Alister MacArthur was back in the forests, after a two-and-a-half year break, in the MR Motorsport prepared Talbot Sunbeam. Co-driver Claire Tilley, from Craignure, Mull, had only completed one event prior to this in the car and that was on tarmacadam and mostly in the dark of Mull Rally. Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st. Drama nearly robbed them of a great result when the alternator stopped working and the battery started to go flat in the last  miles of Lochletter , with Alister switching off all but the bare essential electric components to try and make it to the finish. Finish they did and in nd place overall and third in Class . A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready. He had a late call to co-drive for Linzi Henderson in her Ford Fiesta but they were one of the unlucky crews to slide off the road in Stage , only a mile from the start, spectacularly attempting to knock down some trees in the process.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was out in the Subaru Impreza of Graeme Sherry in what is slowly becoming a weekend habit # one which has his mother watching nervously from the wings. They had a good day and brought the car home in th overall and eighth in a competitive Class . They plan to do the full season, so watch this space for updates on their progress.The closely contested event was finally won by Michael Binnie and Clare Mole in a Mitsubishi Evo, with the ever present Jock Armstrong and Cameron Fair taking second place in the TEG Sport Impreza, after leading the rally for much of the day.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

but the universal approach is being advised by the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes that: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.For the first phase of reopening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Local authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean looking at places like outdoor space in schools, as well as libraries, community halls, leisure centres, conference centres and even taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation to use as classrooms.As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in particular, as much normality as possible in the school environment is really important.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot underestimate the challenges of that but it is absolutely central to all of this careful planning that is underway."},{"url":null,"title":"can-pubs-reopen-glasgow-plan-ease-lockdown-revealed","story":"The four-phase plan will begin as of next week, with a number of measures being relaxed on May .More outdoor activity including sportsmeeting other households and the re-opening of recycling centres are among those being re-introduced at what is being described as Phase .But these areentirely dependent on dramatically reducing coronavirusin the country and successfully implementing a ldquoTest and Protect strategy.For those of us hankering for a leisurely drink in our local, the subject of ing to Scotlands pubs has been addressed in the route map.Current lockdown restrictions mean pubs and restaurants have been forced to close.The measures introduced yesterday also reveal that pubs will be forced to remain closed during Phase  -

When a montage of Nigelrsquos le ndash which had clearly been a wonderfully happy one ndash was played at the end, I found myself choking back the tears.And Iwasnrsquot the only one, as the extraordinary outpouring of grief for Nigel has highlighted. Don spoke movingly of the ldquoNigel-shaped hole that now exists in his le, and it is testament to this particularly good boy that so many viewers also felt such acute loss at his passing.At a deeper level the reaction also relates to the terrible and frightening times we are living through, while speaking to the ability dogs have to comfort and heal human beings ndash even through a television set.:Garry Scott: Its a dogs le under lockdownldquoPure is the word Don used to describe Nigel, and many of us will recognise and cling to this quality in our canine companions as the coronavirus wreaks misery and chaos all around. Dogs face each day with the same enthusiasm, find the same unbridled joy in every single throw of the ball and rub of the belly. Who doesnrsquot envy a dogrsquos ability to live purely and fully in the moment, even this uniquely awful, scary one They are also natural comedians, of course, and at this point I must give special mention to BBC Sport commentator Andrew Cotterrsquos viral videos featuring his labradors Mabel and Olive. All three surely deserve awards ndash and maybe a letimersquos supply of Bonios ndash for their service to the nation during the pandemic.The unconditional love given freely by dogs, and their unembarrassed reliance upon our reciprocation, is quite overwhelming in its purity. It can be a lesaver, too. Don has talked publicly about his struggles with depression over the years, reiterating how his dogs helped him through the darkest times. Many reading this now will be able to relate. Even those who have never suffered from clinical depression may find themselves struggling to negotiate the loneliness of lockdown. At the most fundamental level dogs give us something to live for, something to get out of bed for. They love us evenwe donrsquot love ourselves. They heal us gladly, unknowingly, just by being themselves.And thatrsquos medical fact. Scientic studies show how dogs reduce stress, depression, loneliness and anxiety. They make us healthier, physically and mentally, by encouraging us to take exercise and socialise. People with dogs have lower blood pressure and are less likely to develop heart disease than others. Just playing with a dog releases enough dopamine to give you an instant high.Irsquove come to rely on this dopamine fix. I donrsquot have dogs of my own ndash I live with a much-loved elderly cat I would never describe as ldquopure ndash but Irsquove been walking my neighboursrsquo chocolate labradors while they shield. Taking Sam and Morag to chase balls in the park has saved my mental health during lockdown I honestly donrsquot know how Irsquod have coped without their infectious, undying enthusiasmthese last few weeks.During the worst of times it is natural that we yearn for and search out innocence, purity and goodness. Animals innately possess and exude these qualities. They anchor us to a better world. They remind us that a better world exists. And they encourage us to find even a small amount of happiness in every moment, regardless of how bleak it seems.:Susan Swarbrick: How dogs are enriching our lives more than everAs humanity tries to find a way through the coronavirus our ability to understand its signicance is both a blessing and a misfortune. With this in mind, I canrsquot help thinking the tears I cried for a TV dog I have never met perhaps represented a deeper grief for the loss of innocence the crisis has forced upon us all.In the meantime, rest in peace dear Nigel.

They believe this will allow the creative energies of the people, ground down by the nine to five, to be released.New ideas will flourish. Voluntary work will become the norm. Wersquoll all become poets and musicians. Only worthwhile jobs will remain because no one need do any work they donrsquot want to do ndash like empty bins or sell stuff.It is a pleasant fantasy, and taken seriously by many visionaries, including tech billionaires like Facebookrsquos Mark Zuckerberg and Teslarsquos Elon Musk, who wonder what is going to be done with all the surplus people once everything is automated.Nicola Sturgeon is an advocate of UBI and has more or less promised it in an independent Scotland. There are trials under way in Scottish councils.Most fans of UBI regard themselves as being on the left, like Barack Obama and Yanis Varoufakis. However, the idea has a long history on the right.The famous Alaskan scheme, the Permanent Fund Dividend , was introduced by a Republican Governor, Jay Hammond, in . The recently-completed UBI experiment in Finland was initiated by a right-wing government which included the True Finns in .Now, Irsquom not playing the Twitter game here of guilt by association. An idea can be worthwhile no matter who supports it. However, it is not an accident that UBI is attractive to tech plutocrats and small state visionaries.To those on the left, UBI seems like an exercise in humane wealth redistribution, and to a certain extent it is. But those on the right see it very dferently: as a means of undermining the big state. Citizenrsquos income becomes a lever against spending policies.In Alaska, the Independent Democrat governor, Bill Walker, recently tried to reduce the PFD in order to improve education funding. Last year he was defeated by the Republican Mike Dunleavy who promised instead to double the UBI, and cut public spending in the state by pound. billion.Public services being sacriced in order to put more free money into peoplesrsquo pockets isnrsquot quite what advocates of UBI envisage. But there is a logic here:peoplersquos incomes are determined exclusively by the state, politics will become about the level of that distribution.Imagine a system in which everyone receives pound, a year, as proposed by the Reform Scotland think tank. Leave aside the increase in taxes required to pay for it. Rich or poor old or young, you get the same chunk of change from HM Government.First off, this is not enough to live on and is the same as the current level of Universal Credit, currently pound a week. It is a mystery to me why this is seen as a boon to humankind. A whole raft of means-tested benefits would have to be added on top, like housing benefit, disability benefit and child benefit.UBI advocates say: well, itrsquos only a start. Anyway, people can top it up with a job. But think of what happens at election time Along comes the Real Income Party of Fiscal Fortitudeled by a charismatic populist who says, like Dunleavy in Alaska: ldquoThis isnrsquot a universal income itrsquos universal poverty. Vote for me and Irsquoll double it.Since taxes will already be sky high to pay for UBI phase one, he or she will promise to pay by making the state more ldquoefficient. Get rid of bureaucrats. Cut waste. End subsidies. Get rid of immigrants trying to grab our money.This populist aspect of UBI hasnrsquot been considered because most of the existing UBI experiments are not UBI. In Finland, , long-term unemployed were given euro a month for two years subject to a means test. The results were indferent, though most of the recipients said they felt better. But this was not UBI, which is meant to be given to everyone, working or not.Spain is about to introduce another non-UBI. The Socialist-Podemos government is planning a non-contributory cash payment of around euro, a month restricted to families who fall out of the existing means-tested social safety net.Neither the Spanish nor the Finnish scheme is inidual, unconditional or universal, the three key criteria for UBI. Politicians hailing these schemes, like Labourrsquos Rebecca Long-Bailey, appear to be unaware of this.Other schemes exist in the developing world. The biggest, in Kenya covering , villagers and paid for by the US charity GiveDirectly, has been under way since . It has been praised for not constituting a disincentive to work. But since the UBI there is only  dollars a month, that is perhaps not surprising.Any UBI worth the name in a country like the UK would have to be set at something close to average wages. Otherwise, what is the point  I simply donrsquot see the sense in offering people a UBI at the same poverty level as Universal Credit.And to give a living UBI to everyone, wealthy included, and then tax everyone massively to pay for it, seems to be a perverse form of redistribution.UBI is addressing a serious issue. Think tanks claim that automation will kill a third of all routine jobs. Capitalism doesnrsquot need big workforces any more because it has evolved beyond industrialisation.But UBI is not the way. The benefits of automation should be spread by taxation, shorter hours and higher pay, not by creating a society of serfs living on a miserable stipend.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

A shop assistant was palpably distressed as she told me she couldnrsquot go with her pregnant daughter for her scan, or see the twins she usually collects twice a week from school. One of my friends had booked to fly to Australia to be with her daughter when her baby ndash the first grandchild ndash arrived. Instead, she is stranded thousands of miles away, anxiously watching the calendar, and knitting, knitting, knitting.Itrsquos no surprise that the likes of Zoom and Facetime have become emotional le-rafts, with everyone rushing to climb aboard. Earlier this week, my sister was making granola with an eight-year-old, an hourrsquos drive away in Glasgow. With four of her grandsons in one household, portal sessions can be chaotic. The two-year-old usually makes an appearance only at the bottom of the screen, detected by a tuft of blond hair moving at speed beyond reach.If you could see the profiles of those using this technology, yoursquod find it flooded with retirees, desperate for a glimpse of their families and their youngest. It might be a poor substitute for a hug, but most would agree that online chats are better than nothing. Children grow so swtly, time-lapse photography would make you giddy. They shoot up faster than Leylandii, and learn new words every day. My great-nephewrsquos favourite just now is ldquodisgusting. He applies this to his motherrsquos cooking.Half the older population is probably, like me, filling their devices with adorable pictures, and frantically upgrading their cloud storage to contain it all. It makes me wonder, did my grandparents delight in photos of my siblings and me  Irsquoll never know. Thinking of them is like going back to another place and time ndash which is where, as Edwardian Londoners, they came from. When I was a girl, most folk were considered decrepit at . And often they were, worn out from work and hardship. Reaching retirement was the time for pipe and slippers rather than bungee jumping or skying. The grandchildren who visited once a week, or month, or at Christmas, were patted on the head, spoken to in a loud voice, and indulged with sweets. When it was time to leave, there was rarely any protest.I used to envy school friends whose aged relatives were closely involved with their lives. Today, that closeness is taken for granted, as the older folks work a rota, caring for youngsters after school or during holidays, while their parents work.It is one of the loveliest rapports to observe. In a culture that puts a lot of pressure on the young, to do well at school or university, to look good and be popular, the advice and companionship of those who have seen it all, and take a relaxed view, is invaluable. Therersquos much hand-wringing about the state of modern society, with fractured or dysal families causing heartache and instability. Not much is said, however, of the role grandparents play in holding things together and nurturing those on the first and most precarious rungs of le.Adjectives that can be applied to most working mothers and fathers include irritable, harassed and exhausted. Those over , especially once their careers have ended, have shot those rapids and are in calmer waters. Grandchildren instinctively recognise that theyrsquoll find in them a champion who puts them first, whether itrsquos as a bulwark against strict rules and nagging, or simply someone who isnrsquot always watching the clock. Time and patience are the most important gt a grandparent has to give: to play, read, go for a walk, watch a film, or take a child to football practice and roar encouragement from the sidelines. It doesnrsquot really matter what they actually do together, simply having someonersquos attention for a few hours is priceless. And for granddads especially, I suspect, itrsquos a chance to offer something they had in too short supply when they were raising their own brood.In terms of the family machine, therersquos never been a time when this ageing cohort has been more crucial to its smooth running. With most parents working within a year or two of a childrsquos birth, the period when offspring need to be collected from nursery, or be cared for after school or out of term-time, has signicantly expanded. Only recently have economists begun to calculate the worth of this unpaid army of nannies, chauffeurs, shuttlers, carers, cooks, cleaners and counsellors.It wonrsquot surprise anyone who falls into this group to learn that the hidden price of childcare on the national balance sheet is huge. One analysis in  estimated that, on average, such help annually saves a family pound. Thatrsquos pound billion across the UK. Few grandparents would ever see their contribution in pounds and pence, even those who are far from well-off themselves. Yet it is implicitly understood that without their help, countless thousands of households would struggle to hold down their jobs and make ends meet.The ongoing effect of Covid  on contact between generations could be profound. As the world s to work, many grandparents will be obliged to watch on, from relative isolation, for who knows how much longer But for most who are in this predicament, itrsquos not the maths thatrsquos worrying them. It is the absence of physical contact: fingers sticky with chocolate, displays of cartwheels and bunny jumps, revision schedules more complicated than a ScotRail timetable. And it is a two-way loss, children missing out as much as they do. The loving web that binds young and old is usually invisible, and passes largely unnoticed.

What happened was that, during a News at Ten programme, Ms Smith said Nicola Sturgeon had ldquoenjoyed the opportunity to set out her own lockdown rules and not have to follow whatrsquos happening in England and other parts of the UK.But the First Minister took umbrage at this. ldquoNever in my entire political career have I lsquoenjoyedrsquo anything less than this, she said. ldquoMy heart breaks every day for all those who have lost loved ones to this virus. Which prompted Ms Smith to try to clary things: ldquoI had meant to say hellip she has lsquoembracedrsquo the opportunity to make a policy unique to Scotland. I said enjoyedrsquo by mistake.Now, I have no idea what Ms Smithrsquos political opinions are, but there are a few things worth saying about the original news report and the First Ministerrsquos response to it because they reveal quite a bit about the BBC, the SNP, and the relationship between politics and journalism.First, the news report. The problem with reports of this kind in which broadcasters are asked to analyse the dayrsquos events is that theyrsquore trying to do an almost impossible job: analyse whatrsquos going on while appearing to be totally factual and unbiased: in other words, express an opinion without appearing to express an opinion.But the premise is flawed. Sarah Smith. Me. You. We are not unbiased. As soon as a journalist decides to cover one story or another ndash or use one word or another ndash they are being influenced by unconscious bias. Ms Smith was also self-evidently not giving us untainted facts, she was expressing an opinion and it would helpthe BBC used the right word for it ndash opinion ndash and stopped acting, in its rather hoighty-toighty way, like itrsquos completely unbiased. It isnrsquot: it seeks to control bias, which is a totally dferent thing.But as well as defending Sarah Smith, Irsquod also like to make an appeal to the First Minister here, because her response leaves a lot to be desired. First, her tweet was doing a thing that journalists get a lot: responding with how-dare-you horror to something you havenrsquot actually said. Ms Smith was suggesting the First Minister was enjoying, or embracing, the political elements of the crisis, not the personal consequences for the victims, and it was unfair of Ms Sturgeon to suggest otherwise with talk of loved ones and broken hearts.Ms Sturgeon also needs to be careful about the pot she stirs. I was talking to a colleague recently who told me that hersquod been seeing a therapist because of the vilication and mockery hersquod received from SNP supporters, including ministers, and the effect that it had on his self-confidence. You might say: \"If you dish it out, you gotta take it\", but all I would say to senior SNP politicians, including the First Minister, is: before you single out a journalist, take a look behind you at the snarly hordes you are about to unleash and encourage.The other problem with tweets like the First Ministerrsquos is that they encourage something  thatrsquos troubling: a belief among some of her supporters that the BBC is institutionally anti-independence. The BBC is like any other large organisation in Scotland: there are people in it who believe in independence and there are people who donrsquot, and it does at least have rules that seek impartiality. But, in tweet after tweet, its critics accuse it of being anti-independence and the result is what psychologists call an availability cascade: a belief that grows because of the number of people saying it.The cascade also has another curious effect. SNP supporters who believe the BBC is biased against independence have boycotted its coverage. For them, this preserves the cascade, but the problem for the BBC is that other viewers ndash unionists, left-wingers, right-wingers ndash are doing the same thing for dferent reasons.Which leads us back to poor Sarah Smith standing there with a microphone trying to navigate it all and appear neutral. What shersquos saying to us is: ldquoTrust me, Irsquom a journalist ndash a neutral, unbiased BBC journalist. But perhaps the BBC could be more honest about whatrsquos really going on: she is expressing an opinion. And perhaps, when she hears the opinion, the First Minister could try to be a little less touchy.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

After three years in the making, the release date for Eye Of The Storm coincided smack bang with the upheaval and uncertainty of a global pandemic. The bands upcoming tour, scheduled for May and June, was swtly shelved.\"All those plans were up in smoke as soon as coronavirus came in and changed everything,\" says singer-songwriter Robert Robertson, his voice drting down the line from Fort William, where he has been staying with family since lockdown began.Yet, what seemed like bad timing, soon proved to be serendipity. For a start, the albums title has proved uncannily apt given humanitys current plight.Then theres the raft of lyrics which, although penned long before anyone had ever heard of Covid-, are filled with heartfelt sentiment about overcoming adversity and the need for a strong sense of community.The band ndash lead vocalist Robertson, Ross Wilson on keyboards, guitarist Alasdair Turner and drummer Gus Munro ndash did a -night virtual world tour at the end of April, ahead of the album being released earlier this month.Flying aboard \"Tide Lines Airways\", they city-hopped, via Google Earth, to New York, Paris, London, Moscow, Cairo, Rio, Tokyo, Sydney and Rome, before rounding off the tour in Tobermory on Mull, the island that Wilson hails from.:Island odyssey: Tamsin Calidas lays bare le on a Hebridean croft ndash from ruin to redemptionTheir goal was for Eye Of The Storm ndash which the band produced themselves ndash to make the UK Top . Impressively, it debuted at No, simultaneously topping both the Scottish and independent album charts.So, who are Tide Lines  Here, we learn more about the bands remarkable journey to date.ORIGIN STORYThe four-strong line-up packs a pedigree. Tide Lines was formed in  after Robertson and Wilson parted ways with Scottish traditional band, Skipinnish, to experiment with their own music. They recruited Turner for his guitar and bagpipes prowess, and Munro, formerly the drummer with alt-rock trio Sucioperro.Less than  hours after the bands official launch on social media in June , their first single, Far Side Of The World, entered the UK download charts ahead of tracks by Coldplay, Beyonce and Adele. Tide Lines takes its name from a lyric in the song that goes: \"In my mind I see her smile, where the tide lines grace the isle\". A debut album, Dreams We Never Lost, followed in .THEIR DISTINCTIVE SOUNDFolk philosophy and big guitars are among Tide Lines signature style. Or as Robertson puts it: \"A melting pot of musical influences come out when we are in the studio.\" His love of classic artists, such as Bruce Springsteen, is juxtaposed alongside Wilson and Turners passion for electronica, and Munros alt-rock background.Robertson has been writing songs since childhood. \"I have early memories of being in the car with my mum and dad on a long journey and when we got to our destination, I had written out lyrics and a tune on the back of an envelope.\"What normally happens is a melody randomly comes into my head. I have been walking through an airport before when thats happened and needed to quickly stop and record it on my phone. Afterwards, I sit down and try to develop the tune, the chords and put words to it.\"Once I have it at the stage where its - per cent there, Ill take it to the boys andthey give the thumbs up, we will book into a studio and jam it. Thats when our dferent musical influences come to the fore. Everyone adds in their ideas and it can sometimes change beyond all recognition from my original idea with their input. It is very collaborative.\"ASKING TAYLOR SWIFT ON A DATERobertson and Wilson recorded a cover version of Taylor Swts hit Shake It Off in . The video went viral with Outlander star Sam Heughan among those sharing it in a bid to catch Swts eye. Robertson offered to take the American singer-songwriter out for dinner in Glasgow.:Lockdown Learnings: Coal, steel and a way of le swept away ndash delving into family history\"I asked her for a curryI remember rightly,\" he says. \"The offer still stands. I have no memory of why we decided to cover it, but it was a good laugh. That was before we formed Tide Lines.\"TAPPING INTO THE ZEITGEISTIt is impossible not to be struck by the myriad lines woven throughout Eye Of The Storm that could have been written as astute reflections of le in lockdown.\"Theres lot of the lyrics on the new album that people are relating to because of this situation,\" confirms Robertson. \"There is a line in Shadow To The Light that goes: Theres a place I see, in the all-too-distant light  Of the sun and rain  And no matter what lies ahead of us now  We will be OK.\"That was written long before I had ever heard of coronavirus and I didnt realise how appropriate it is until people pointed it out. The emphasis is on what lies ahead of us ndash rather than you or me as iniduals. It is about the sense of community.\"A LOVE OF GAELICGiven that Robertson won the prestigious An Comunn Gaidhealach Gold Medal for singing at the  Royal National Mod in Paisley, a fierce passion for Gaelic should come as little surprise.Eye Of The Storm has a cover of Canan nan Gaidheal ndash which translates as Language of the Gaels ndash by the late Lewis-born poet and songwriter Murdo Macfarlane.\"The thing that runs through our music is the influence of growing up with Gaelic, folk songs and living in the Highlands,\" says Robertson. \"The general content of the subjects I write about ndash landscapes, love and longing ndash are probably quite similar to those that have inspired Gaelic songs over the years.\":Is it a bird  Is it a plane  The strangest unexplained sightings in Scotlandrsquos skiesIn March, inspired by footage of people singing from windows and balconies around the world, Robertson sang a few lines of a Gaelic song from his second-floortenement flat in Glasgow. The clip has been shared more than a million times.THAT IMPROMPTU \"WORLD\" TOUR\"The best way to promote an album is to go out and play it live,\" says Robertson. \"Thanks to the joys of social media I was able to go live from the comfort of my own living room.\"On the first night, there was a little Tide Lines aeroplane taking you from Fort William to New York on Google Earth. I came on and sang Welcome To New York by Taylor Swt, then New York, New York by Frank Sinatra.\"I did one song from the album each night for  nights leading up to its release. To represent each city or country on the tour, I had a prop Id found around the house. For Paris I had red wine and grapes. In Italy, it was a little glass of cloudy apple juice I pretended was limoncello.\"I would get records from my dads collection for each place. There was Michelle by The Beatles for Paris and I sang Back In The USSR for Moscow. Id say: Tomorrow were in Cairo, what should I sing  People suggested songs like Night Boat To Cairo and Walk Like An Egyptian.\"AVOIDING THE CURSE OF THE DIFFICULT SECOND ALBUMAs the old adage goes, fortune favours the brave. Their best-laid plans may have been upended by the coronavirus pandemic, but the band pressed on. \"The album was released on May  and on the Monday after that, the Official Charts Company had us at No for the whole of the UK,\" he says.\"Of course, we were surrounded in that chart by artists who are world-famous and have a major record label behind them with all the benefits that brings. Realistically, we knew that as the week went on, we were going to go flying back down the charts but hoped to stay within the UK Top .\"We ended up at No in the UK and were absolutely delighted. Then, finding out we were No in Scotland and No in the independent album charts, we couldnt believe it.:Island odyssey: Tamsin Calidas lays bare le on a Hebridean croft ndash from ruin to redemption\"There was a statistic from the Official Charts Company that said not only were we No in Scotland, but for that week, we outsold the rest of the Top  combined.

I fear, too many of us believe that unlocking is \"back to normal\".The success of this virus,you want to call it that, is in its ability to exploit weaknesses. The resulting pandemic has certainly exposed the underlying health issues in our population as well those in our systems, our key services. These in turn have also exposed weak and slow political decision-making and in some cases incompetent messaging, the consequences for which in terms of death will have political and financial cost which will play out in due course.Dr Nabarro stated that \"its personal behaviour as well thats extremely important in reducing the likelihood of explosive outbreaks developing over the summer and into the autumn\".When asked about the setting of dates for reducing restrictions he continued: \"My request to all countries, that rather than giving precise dates, they say well release the lockdown when we know that weve got the defence mechanisms in place, when we know that our people understand the severity of this virus.\"Before we take the next small unlocking step, we need to check that we all know what we have to do. My fear is that we are nowhere near putting a tick in that last box. I think the politicians need to be honest and pay more attention to the messaging. It feels like too many of us have the impression that unlocking is a binary event that puts us back to normal. Lets face it, we arent going back to normal any time soon, certainly not this year. Our ability to understand where we are with this, to understand what we need to do and to adopt those behaviours is the next test. If we fail here, that is a weakness the virus will exploit next, for sure.Lets stop and think it through, what effect is my behaviour having on my family and others, perhaps more vulnerable  Could my behaviour make others anxious  Is my behaviour helping or hindering the transmission of this virus Im sure though that we are smart enough to get our heads around this and start really caring for each other so that perhaps well never get back to normal, but to something much better.David Morrish, Banchory.PANDEMICS are not like other global crises. They are dynamic, full of uncertainty, spread very fast as a result of modern transport and communications and affect whole populations. Yet we routinely ignore these low probability, high impact threats without thinking broadly and deeply about the disruption and cost. And we often quickly forget afterwards or fall rapidly into previous behaviours.I hope that the Scottish Government will commission a public inquiry in the near future so we can all learn the lessons ndash good and bad ndash from Covid- and its aftermath.Such an inquiry needs to draw on evidence, opinion and good ideas from all segments of our society from the public and private sectors and from academia and research and development. It must be impartial and transparent.It needs to consider what can be done in the future by those at the coal face as well as in Holyrood and all parts of our citizenship in between. Input needs to be collected now not when this pandemic has subsided.Lastly, lessons captured need to be learned and converted into best practice by an organisation set up especially and dedicated to ensure we improve resilience across our society and are better prepared for the next similar challenge.Malcolm Warr, Prestwick.Read more: Sturgeon publishes route map out of lockdown"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-swinney-backs-away-target-2000-contact-tracers-june","story":"The Deputy First Minister said the current  tracers would be ldquosufficient to get the system up and running next week, despite an official target of  by June .Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, he said ldquoevery effort would be made to increase the numbers, but offered no guarantee another  would be ready next week.The retreat comes just a day after Nicola Sturgeon told Holyrood the target would not be missed, telling MSPs the plans were ldquonot lagging behind but ldquomoving at pace.She said: ldquoWe will have a capacity of  in place by the end of this month. We have the testing capacity that we need for that.The Scottish Tories said Ms Sturgeon now had to be \"straight with the public\" about hittingthe target and not try to row back without peoples noticing.Contact tracing is at the heart of the Scottish Governments four-stage route map out of the lockdown, as it will identy the sick and those they might have infected.It is intended toreduce the risk of the disease spreading once restrictions start to be lted in stages from May .In her foreword to the plan, published yesterday, the First Minister saidcontact tracing was ldquoan important part of our integrated strategy and is crucial for infection control, shielding and protecting shielders. It is critical for specic issues, for example, theto schools.Earlier this week, the Scottish Government announced contact new tracing technology was being trialled in Fe, Lanarkshire and Highland health boards.Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said an initial group of  tracers made up of NHS staff were ldquoready to begin this work, as part of the process of recruiting up to  staff.She later said the  staff would be ldquoready to be deployed on June .However on Good Morning Scotland, Mr Swinney was noticeably less confidentwhen askedthere had been any new recruits above the existing .He said: ldquoSix hundred is the last number that I have available to me, and thatrsquos sufficient contact tracers to get the system up and running for what we require at the end of this month.Pressed on the June target, he said: ldquoIrsquom sure every effort will be made to increase the numbers, but  is a good contingent of numbers to have in place to begin the work on contact tracing.ldquoContact tracing is only valuable where you have suppressed the level of coronavirus in the community to be able to manage all of those contacts and to pursue them.ldquoSo we will have the resources in place to do that so that we can take forward the test and protect strategy that the First Minister outlined yesterday.ldquoAnd that will be anintegral part in supporting the decisions that we can take under the route map to further relax the constraints that people are operating under.His comments contrasted with Ms Sturgeonrsquos statementto MSPs after she published her map andopposition parties queried the governments ability totestand trace at scale.She denied the government was behind schedule and insisted a ldquosubstantial, signicant test and protection operation would be ready in all  regional health boards next week.She told MSPs: ldquoI want to align our lting of lockdown with our ability to implement a substantial, signicant test and protect operation. We will be able to do that from the end of next week in every health board area in the country.ldquoThe plans for that are not lagging behind. They are moving at pace.ldquoThe health secretary confirmed at the weekend that health boards have already identied  iniduals who are ready to do that. We will have a capacity of  in place by the end of this month. We have the testing capacity that we need for that.Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw said:ldquoGiven how critical contact tracing is to exiting lockdown, itrsquos vital the First Minister is straight with the public.ldquoIt sounds like John Swinney doesnrsquot think the  target is going to be met, andthatrsquos the case people and businesses need to know.ldquoThe SNP canrsquot row back on this commitment and hope nobody will notice.ldquoNicola Sturgeon needs to say how many contact tracers, over and above the  Mr Swinney is talking about, have been recruited, and will she have  in place by June  like she said.ldquoIf that commitment is going to be broken, when will there be  contact tracers ready and available to work ldquoWe all want contact tracing to work because itrsquos the only way out lockdown, and we all want to be confident in the system.ldquoBut that will only happenthe SNP is transparent and accountable about what progress is being made.Mr Swinney also said the route mapwas ldquopredicated on new working patterns, including more home working and an end to the traditional rush hour on public transport.The Education Secretary said: ldquoWe are not going toto a pre-Covid normal of how schools or businesses operated.Certainly for schools itrsquos not going to be the same as Pre-Covid when the schools go back, hopefully on the th of August.ldquoAnd for many businesses theyrsquove had to adapt to a lot of people working from home and our route map is predicated on lots more people continuing to work from home to contribute towards the work of their employers.ldquoWhat this will require is employers to be flexible about the way in which theyrsquore asking their employees to engage in work.ldquoWersquove stressed in the route map that we canrsquot have ato crowded trains and crowded buses of people going at the one time to work in the rush hour.ldquoWersquore going to have to spread that over a longer period of time so that public transport is less congested at key moments of the day.ldquoThere will have to be an adaptation as a society, not just in our schools but right across society.He agreed it was complicated and that ministers were realising it was easier to go into lockdown than come out of it."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/6396037.jpg?type=article-full","title":"touching-tribute-bright-light-eilidh-macleod-mark-three-years-since-manchester-arena-bombing","story":"Eilidh MacLeod from the Isle of Barra was one of  killed by a terroristrsquos bomb following an Ariana Grande concert on May , .The -year-old now has a charity in her name - the Eilidh Macleod Memorial Trust - who have this year paid tribute to their bright light, and say she will never be forgotten.\"A bright light and a spark of fun was extinguished that night, making our worlds darker and poorer as a result,\" the charity wrote on their Facebook page. \"The events at Manchester Arena have left a mark on all of our lives.:Scots teenager killed in Manchester Arena attack to be honoured at gala event\"We all have happy memories of Eilidh and the part she played in our lives.

but the universal approach is being advised by the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes that: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.For the first phase of reopening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Local authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean looking at places like outdoor space in schools, as well as libraries, community halls, leisure centres, conference centres and even taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation to use as classrooms.As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in particular, as much normality as possible in the school environment is really important.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot underestimate the challenges of that but it is absolutely central to all of this careful planning that is underway."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11400487.jpg?type=article-full","title":"can-pubs-reopen-glasgow-plan-ease-lockdown-revealed","story":"The four-phase plan will begin as of next week, with a number of measures being relaxed on May .More outdoor activity including sportsmeeting other households and the re-opening of recycling centres are among those being re-introduced at what is being described as Phase .But these areentirely dependent on dramatically reducing coronavirusin the country and successfully implementing a ldquoTest and Protect strategy.For those of us hankering for a leisurely drink in our local, the subject of ing to Scotlands pubs has been addressed in the route map.Current lockdown restrictions mean pubs and restaurants have been forced to close.The measures introduced yesterday also reveal that pubs will be forced to remain closed during Phase  - meaning they will not be open on May .Much of the new data being discussed by Scottish Government officials is around the potential for greater outdoor activity - which can be seen around plans for easing exercise restrictions.As such, the re-opening of pubs will begin with beer gardens.Under the plans, pubs and restaurants with outdoor spaces can reopen in Phase  - the exact date of which is not yet clear.This will be done provided social distancing is met and there are increased hygiene measures.The route-map suggests that pubs can open their indoor spaces from Phase  in the four-phased plan.This will again only be done with physical distancing indoors and increase hygiene routines.Finally, by Phase , all pubs will be open as normal -

one of the causes of the common cold - as a conduit to deliver genetic material to the cells that codes for SARS-CoV-.These cells then produce the virus distinctive spike protein, and travel to the lymph nodes where the immune system creates antibodies that will be able torecognise that spike protein and fight off the coronavirus.Volunteers were enrolled from one site in Wuhan, China, and assigned to receive either low, medium or high doses of the vaccine.: NHS staff in Glasgow asked to join Covid vaccine trialThe researchers tested the volunteersrsquo blood at regular intervals following vaccination to see whether the vaccine stimulated both antibody and T cell production - the two strands of human immune response.It is thought that the ideal vaccine will be able to generate both antibody and T cell responses.After  days, most participants had a four-fold increase in binding antibodies, which that can attach to the coronavirus but do not necessarily attack it.However, half to three-quarters of participants had developed neutralising antibodies, which do attack pathogens.Importantly, the Ad-nCoV vaccine also stimulated a rapid T cell response in the majority of volunteers, which was greater in those given the higher and middle doses of vaccine.T cells are important because they are capable of recognising and destroying other cells in the bodyinfected with the virus ndash not just the viral pathogen itself.Further analyses showed that  days after vaccination, the majority of recipients showed either a positive T cell response or had detectable neutralising antibodies.: Covid spread like cruise ship after patients were transferred from Glasgow superhospital into open bay wardsHowever, the authors note that both the antibody and T-cell response could be reduced by high pre-existing immunity to adenovirus type .A randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase  trial of the Ad-nCoV vaccine has now been initiated in Wuhan to determine whether the results can be replicated, andthere are any adverse events up to six months after vaccination.It will involve  participants being given dferent doses of the vaccine or a placebo vaccine."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : pmTen packages containing illegal drugs have been intercepted from the postal system by local police officers and the Orkney Drugs Dog charity, since the beginning of lockdown.

Forcing MPs to choose between the safety of our communities and equal representation is unacceptable.“Parliament must be a forum where every part of the United Kingdom can participate equally. The Secretary of State knows this better than most and the challenges posed to communities that are more distant from parliament. We are calling on him to be a voice for equal representation in government.”Mr Jack was questioned on the issue in parliament yesterday, by SNP MP Allan Dorans. Mr Jack said: #Members of Parliament are key workers. More importantly, as a cabinet minister and a secretary of state, it is right that I should be here in the chamber so that I can be properly scrutinised and answer these questions.#I came down at the weekend and travelled on a train very safely. I willsafely and I will be isolating myself when I do, but that is solely because I go back to family.

Signicant adjustments will also be required across our public transport services as the lockdown is eased in the coming weeks and months and the safety of the travelling public is hugely important.“The committee wants to hear about the experiences of iniduals and businesses and whether they feel they have received the support they need to survive and recover from this crisis.“We also want to learn about examples of good practice as we consider what lessons can be learned about the response to the pandemic and also how existing practices may need to change as we move forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For those isles without shops, residents will receive a direct payment instead.“Our aim is to recognise the vital role isles shops play at the heart of their communities – and to provide some support for the residents they serve,” said James Stockan, Council Leader and Councillor for Stromness and the South Isles.“There’s been positive feedback from many folk in the isles over recent weeks and I hope this extension to the scheme will be welcomed.”The cost of the vouchers over the eight-weeks period will be approximately £,, which will slightly exceed the £, Food Fund funding allocation the Council received from the Scottish Government.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England.

It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s.

This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

With these, on Friday th May, pupils took part in three virtual quizzes, via Google Meet, one each for nursery, P- and P-.During the summer term at school, the pupils would normally take part in a fundraising event.Teachers linked this with the quiz and asked for a donation to charity in order to take part. Three children’s charities were chosen to vote for by families, and the winning one was Young Minds, a charity that supports children and young people’s mental health.Donations were made through Just Giving.Mairi MacKenzie, a teacher at the school, said: “It was great that so many of the pupils took part, and it was brilliant to see them interact during lockdown.“It is important for us, as staff, to keep the school reunited, even though we cannot be together in person.“We are, of course, also delighted to be raising money for a very worthy charity during what is a very challenging time for many.”The quiz was also shared with other children in the community, where they were given an opportunity to download the quiz, and also donate to Young Minds.To date, the fundraising effort is over £.The teachers already have plans in place for another virtual event in the coming weeks.Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s annual end of term cèilidh was held online last Friday for the first time ever and was extremely well received with almost , viewers watching the Facebook live event.The event brings the academic year to an end and gives both students and staff the opportunity to come together at the college for a night of music, dancing and entertainment.Comann nan Oileanach decided to put together the Cèilidh Mhòr online via Zoom with a ceilidh thereafter on Facebook live, hosted by Iain Smith fromTrail West.The event on Zoom included music from SMO students, Micheal Steele and Saffron Hanvidge, a cocktail masterclass and, for the first time, CnO’s Student Awards which commended iniduals on ious achievements, teaching and SMO community work.As part of the evening, CnO decided to raise money for the Skye charity – Skye Community Response – this year and the total sum at present is £.A new free online tuition service is being launched by arts organisation Fèisean nan Gàidheal.A video series of traditional music lessons, at dferent levels, has been created in Gaelic and English to support those with no Gaelic, learners of the language and fluent Gaelic speakers.The ‘Oide’series currently offers lessons in accordion, fiddle and Gaelic song, with more instruments available soon, thanks to further funding from the Scottish Government.The lessons, which are suitable for all ages and abilities, are led by some of the most experienced traditional music tutors in the country, including accordionist Ian Smith from popular folk band, Trail West, fiddler Robbie Grieg, who plays with electronic folk band, INYAL, and singers James Graham, Eilidh Cormackand Deirdre Graham..The project comes under the banner of FèisTV, with funding from Bòrd na Gàidhlig, Creative Scotland and Highlands and Islands Enterprise,Kate Forbes MSP has welcomed almost  extra weekly collection slots for Tesco supermarket orders for constituents living on the Isle of Skye.The constituency MSP had been approached by several constituents on the island who are in the shielding category but had been unable to book a collection slot for weeks in advance.Some feared they would have to break self-isolation to go to the local shops for essential supplies.Following constructive discussions with Tesco officials, most notably the Dingwall store management who are responsible for all Skye and Lochalsh deliveries, an extra two vans were added to serve this route.The extra slots began earlier this month.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/broadband.jpg","title":"editorial internet is an essential utility so it should be affordable and accessible in every corner of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIt was a unique fundraiser in many ways.It took the form of a collective sponsored run and walk from Land#s End to John O#Groats.That is a distance of  miles.

The UK is online more than most other countries in the world.According to the Office for National Statistics, last year  per cent of UK citizens, including  per cent of Scots, were regular internet users.Within the European Unionwe were third behind only Denmark and Luxembourg when it came to logging in, and ahead of such giants as Germany and France.If computer literacy equalled prosperity, as to some degree it must, we would have little to fear.That is why Skye Camanachd#s fundraiser was so inclusive and so successful.It would not have been as feasible in, for instance, Italy, where a full quarter of the population are strangers to the internet. In Bulgaria, with just  per cent of internet use, it would not even be worth trying.In this country at least, the coronavirus pandemic has seen the internet come of age.It has played a formidable part in keeping people connected, in easing the loneliness of elderly folk confined to their homes, in providing entertainment for young and old alike.It has allowed people to work from home: a sector of employment which will almost certainly continue to expand when the virus has gone.It has also, on a less important level, allowed at least one local newspaper to continue to contribute to its community.It is perhaps too easy for the  per cent of us who use the internet regularly, without second thought, to forget the other ten per cent of our compatriots who are not so fortunate.Ten per cent of us, that is half a million people in Scotland alone, cannot or do not use this new technology.Most of them are elderly, but some are not.Some are kids whose parents cannot afford it. Some are those very parents, who find themselves cut adrt from what in normal times had become a mainstay of our society, and which in these extraordinary times is helping to keep us together.There will always be those who opt out:  per cent internet connectivity will not occur in any society at any time.But those who wish to opt in, but are prevented because of poor broadband or expensive servers, should from now on be properly and fully enabled to do so.The internet has become an essential utility, and it should formally be recognised as such.It is as necessary to us as gas and electricity, telephones, the railways, decent sewage and a good water supply.The United Kingdom had until recently a fine record in supplying and maintaining its utilities.Some began in private hands and were nationalised for much of the th century. Others were and remain in the accountable control of local government.Even when the larger British utilities were privatised during the s and s, which was the equivalent of the Conservative Party giving its friends in big business a licence to print money, their unique importance was recognised by the simultaneous establishment of independent watchdogs such as Ofgem and Ofcom # the second of which has, through the telephone network, a vague and ill-defined authority over the internet.That vagueness should be claried that definition should be made in no uncertain terms.Nobody made the internet an essential utility.It has become one by popular consensus.Now that it is no longer a recreational luxury, but a basic necessity for any full member of our st century society, it must be made affordable and properly accessible in every corner of the land.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/martin-sanchez-Tzoe6VCvQYg-unsplash-scaled.jpg","title":"new covid case in skye activates new contact tracing","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe health board was confirmed last week as one of three areas in Scotland to trial new contact tracing s ahead of a national roll-out of the Test, Trace, Isolate and Support strategy aimed at halting the spread of infection.The latest case of Covid- on Skye was reported on Thursday night, and NHS Highland has said it had contacted all those directly affected, given them the appropriate advice and is in the process of organising testing. nursing home, where over  cases were reported and where  residents who tested positive for the virus have died. from the health authority who up until now had refused to give details of where in the board area a case was # citing national guidance on patient confidentiality.Kate Forbes said: “NHS Highland has confirmed that there is another case of Covid on Skye, with somebody testing positive.“Having tested this person, the NHS are now effectively tracing the case and contacting all those who have been in contact with the inidual to give them advice and to test them as well.“As soon as there was confirmation of a positive case in Home Farm earlier this month, NHS Highland tested residents and staff of all the care homes on Skye and contacted the households of staff who had confirmed positive to ensure they self-isolated.“There is an increased testing capacity on the island already, with the mobile testing unit complementing the testing facility in Portree.“All resources and support will be provided to ensure that this case does not spread through the community.

The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers. Every job lost is a heavy blow for the inidual concerned, their household, the wider community and economy – especially in the face of the current Covid- pandemic.“Ahead of this announcement being made, I spoke to senior management to call on them to utilise the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to protect jobs and retain skilled workers the prospect of workers being thrown onto the dole queues at this time is unacceptable.“Management confirmed they will be proceeding to a -day consultative period on their proposals but that they will consider furlough as an option. They sought to reassure us of their ambitions for Wrightbus in Ballymena and its centrality to their plans.“Instead of reducing employment, we need to ramp up production of hydrogen-buses to curb greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more environmentally-sustainable economy. “The Wrightbus workforce is perfectly positioned to make a vital contribution to that they have the skills to build the buses at the heart of any future green transport policy.“The request for furlough will be top of Unite’s agenda in the consultation process.

None of the flights I booked were expensive, but it is annoying that the refund I know I am entitled to is so dficult to get.We haven#t incurred huge financial losses, but my husband#s th birthday was spent in the garden and he didn#t get to see family or friends so it was unforgettable - but not in a good way.As it was a surprise, he didn#t know what I had planned until the flights had been cancelled and this only increased the level of disappointment.We don#t go out very much at weekends and our four children are all independent adults living their own lives so we like to spend our savings by going on holiday as often as we can. It isn#t normally three times a year, but it isn#t every year your husband is .We look forward every year to going to new places, exploring our love of architecture and having lazy days on the beach.And while I have a grand back garden that I love spending time in, the thought of doing this in between showers of rain and maybe worse does not fill me with joy. Right now I have my fingers crossed that the coronavirus pandemic will have lessened and maybe air travel will once again be possible so we will get to visit Split at the end of September, but the idea of being on a plane with strangers does concern me.This year has taught me one thing and that is not to be so quick to catch a January bargain.

PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNASUWT general secretary Patrick Roach. By David YoungMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailTeacher unions have given a cautious welcome to the Education Minister#s timetable for restarting schools. The Ulster Teachers# Unionwelcomed Peter Weir#s collaborative approach in getting schools back to a #new normal#, while the NASUWT union said it must be done in a way that is safe and commands public confidence.UTU president Stephen McCord said parents should be assured that teachers want children back in school - but only when it#s safe for them to be there.Children should be in school and we are in touch daily with the Education Department and the Education Authority towards that end, he said.We can assure parents and pupils that we are doing everything we can to get children back at school where they belong, but safely back at school.Education cannot be at the price of health and lives. We welcome the fact that the Minister and Education Authority are listening to us as they plot the way ahead - for it is, after all, teachers who are at the chalk face and know what will work for their schools - and what won#t.Dr Patrick Roach, General Secretary of the NASUWT, said the union has previously welcomed the Stormont Executive#s decision not to rush ahead with the reopening of schools.As plans are now starting to be put together in relation to how schools might begin to reopen in the new academic year, it will be critical that the Executive maintains a cautious approach which does not undermine public health or put at risk the health and safety of teachers or children, he said.Once the details emerge of the arrangements, the NASUWT will evaluate them and advise members in the light of the key tests it has established around making schools Covid- secure and minimising risk.The NASUWT#s bottom line remains that no teacher or pupil should be expected toto school until it can be demonstrated that it is safe to do so.NASUWT Northern Ireland representative Justin McCamphill added: While it has been the practice of some schools to reopen for some days at the end of August to prepare for the beginning of the academic year, it would not be acceptable for inidual schools to move their established starting date without agreement with school trade union representatives.Michael Allen, principal of Lisneal College in Londonderry, told the Belfastthat the minister#s announcement was helpful, in that it brought clarity to the # to school# timetable, and put an end to conjecture about Northern Ireland aligning with other parts of the UK, such as England, where schools are toin June.

During  , the report noted that .% of P pupils had received an autism diagnosis - the highest prevalence rate - which compares to % of children in P.Kerry Boyd, chief executive officer of Autism NI, said these latest figures although alarming, are not unexpected.A report was commissioned by the NI Department of Education which warned of this #autism wave# of diagnosis back in  and this was the motivation for Autism NI#s autism awareness lobby at Stormont which led to the establishment of the Autism Actin , she explained.Since then we have seen an increase in awareness and understanding of autism, which is being demonstrated within these latest statistics. The charity chief continued: For this reason, Autism NI has been lobbying relentlessly over the past  years on the urgent need for adequate autism services and a consistent, unormed approach across all health trusts and education.She insisted autism services here are now at breaking point, with the voluntary sector facing increased demand.Every child with autism should be diagnosed as early as possible and receive a tailored early intervention package to ensure the best outcomes for that child, explained Ms Boyd.It is therefore left to the voluntary sector to fill this #void# but due to the level of demand on Autism NI#s services and lack of funding available, we are stretched to full capacity with very little statutory funding.Therefore, we are calling for an urgent review on autism services to address this crisis and for a ring-fenced budget to be established to ensure autism supports and interventions are available for each and every autism family throughout Northern Ireland.Koulla Yiasouma, NI Commissioner for Children and Young People, welcomed the report#s publication, insisting it will help in highlighting the resources children may need. It is essential that every child and young person experiences their rights, be that in their education or health, so they can flourish and have an equal opportunity to reach their full and maximum potential, she said.The publication identies and highlights particular groups and cohorts of children and young people, so it is important that services also address these iations and patterns.The Commissioner added: Children and young people with autism and or Asperger#s are unique. Each one is special and each will have dferent and inidual needs.It is very important we have a clear understanding of this so it informs the design and delivery of services, and ensures a quality provision that meets those inidual needs.Belfast Most ReadHuge number of Northern Ireland restaurants to close as social distancing rules sound death-knell for the sector,owner warns StormontCoronavirus: Some pupils toto school in late August, education minister announcesFirst floating hotel for Northern Ireland planned with  cabins on -metre Norwegian vessel I did it for the craic, says priest who played The Sash at Mass and put a smile on many a face amid pandemicFermanagh priest left red-faced after The Sash played during Mass ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"544210","story":"Plans for a Magee Medical School opening next year have been cast into doubt after the Economy Minister told a committee meeting that ‘signicant work’ is required and questioned Ulster University’s financial stability. It comes just days after Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that the long-awaited Derry medical school had been agreed by the Executive and said she expects students to enrol in September . Speaking at yesterday’s economy committee meeting, deputy chair and SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said: “It would be remiss of me not to thank you in relation to the Executive announcement regarding Magee, and I know there’s still work to be done but there is an imminent deadline and obviously the first intake of students is September  according to the announcement. googletag.cmd.push “We’re delighted about that and the whole city is definitely celebrating that good news story. Hopefully whatever work has to be done in the next few weeks, everything will go through.” In response DUP Minister Diane Dodds highlighted ‘signicant work’ that has to be done and said additional papers will be presented to the Executive. She commented: “The announcement on the Magee Medical School was a good announcement for the Executive to make, a good announcement for the city, but more importantly just a good announcement for the whole of Northern Ireland. “It is quite clear that we need more doctors and we want more of our young people to be able to train and re-train.” googletag.cmd.push However, she added: “I’m not pretending that the path ahead is easy, there is a signicant amount of work to do in relation to the issues around capacity of Ulster University and the financial position of Ulster University. And there is a signicant amount of work to do about that. “But we have set ourselves on a pathway and we are working quite hard on that. There will be further papers to the Executive on that in due course.” In February the Department of Finance confirmed that a poundm loan had been agreed in the form of an ‘addendum to the business case’ for Ulster University’s vastly over-budget Belfast campus. The Department for the Economy will be responsible for overall approval. The relocation of Jordanstown to Belfast city centre was initially expected to cost poundm but swelled to around poundm. FURTHER WORK On Monday, May , Deputy First Minister revealed that the medical school had been given the go-ahead. But, a short time later, the department responsible for its delivery said further work is needed to guarantee student intake next year. An Executive Office spokesperson stated: “The Executive has reaffirmed its commitment to establish a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee, as set out in New Decade, New Approach. “Further work is being undertaken to secure a sustainable outcome for the project within the fastest possible timescales. “Plans are being progressed that would allow an initial student intake of  in September  and the Executive will consider this issue again next month.” To begin with the school will train  doctors within existing buildings on the Magee campus. Supported by City Deal money, a new Medical School facility is expected to be built along the riverfront but that is likely to lie some years ahead. When fully operational with  students in   it will cost poundm to run per year, according to UU. Speaking at Monday’s press conference Michelle O’Neill said plans are being progressed that ‘will allow the first student intake of  in September ’. She added: “This is a hugely important investment decision for the North West and it adds to the Executives recent announcement on the Derry and Strabane City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund. It will prove to be instrumental in the regeneration of the region and will help to support our health service who we much rely on at this point and into the future. ‘GUARANTEE’ SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has asked for more detail and said a ‘guarantee’ was needed that students will start in . He believes student intake in  is ‘far from certain’ and there are a number of issues to be addressed, including the matter of recurring funding from the Executive. “People don’t have to be put through the hoops that we’ve been put through to get something for Derry but it is largely down to the need for recurring funding. “It’s hopeful, it’s positive, it’s good, but I do think we need to ask questions about how certain this is and I think we’re right to do that given all that we’ve been through.” In terms of long-term goals for expansion, the Foyle MP added: “We need to keep our eye on the big prize and that is , students.” While welcoming the news DUP MLA Gary Middleton said he ‘hoped’ the Magee Medical School would be delivered in . Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Derry University Group , which is campaigning for an independent university in the city, said it is proposing that all future Higher Educationdevelopment in the North West be led and managed under the auspices of an independent university. He added: “UU has neither the finance, capacity nor political will to deliver for Derry. “To that end Derry and Donegal Councils should immediately establish their own HE Development and Scrutiny Committee.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Since then ious groups have fought for a meaningful expansion of the Derry campus. Guarantees of expansion to , students have been repeatedly pushed back, the latest target set by the council and Ulster University is , placesby . The Derry News has taken a closer look at the journey since plans for a Medical School were first mooted in the early s.  In March  Ulster Universityofficially announces plans to build a post-graduate Medical School, however, it had been discussed for years already at this stage. googletag.cmd.push Also in , UU agreed to acquire several acres of lands for expansion at Foyle College on the Duncreggan Road. Those plans would not come to fruition for many years. By   plans were raised to build a major poundm Health Sciences facility in Derry as part of Magee expansion, to help increase numbers from around , studentsto ,. This expansion was shelved in tandem with the announcement that UU would be building an entirely new Stormont-backed Belfast campus – initially expected to cost poundm. As part of ’s multi-agency Derry One Plan UU committed itself to having , full-time students at Magee by . googletag.cmd.push In February , the Minister with responsibility for Higher Education, Stephen Farry, postponed any expansion. He said the Stormont Programme for Government ‘did not contain a commitment to deliver expansion as outlined in the One Plan’. In  UU submits plans for the Medical School and applies to the General Medical Councilto train doctors in the North West. May , First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness reaffirm their commitment to Magee expansion in a draft framework for government. January  Stormont collapses after Martin McGuinness resigns in protest over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal. March , UU works on a number of recommendations made by the Department of Health- including how the school would be funded - but UU says the school remains on track. Professor Louise Dubras is appointed to oversee the delivery of the Medical School. In May , UU appoints Prof Louise Dubras as Foundation Dean of the School of Medicine. In June , the DoH says UU had yet to meet criteria to ‘demonstrate need and value for money’ for a new medical school. November , Ulster University vice chancellor Prof Paddy Nixon confirms the planned  opening cannot go ahead because there is no devolved government. In January  the lands at Foyle College are eventually purchased after drawn-out negotiations. Ambitions for these lands have not be shared. May , a pound City Deal is announced for Derry and Strabane. It later emerges that UU will receive poundm for the Medical School and other projects. November , plans are once again abandoned to open the Medical School and a new target is set for student intake in September  - the absence of a government is blamed. Throughout  Derry councillors express their anger at ongoing delays, demand expansion and call on the council to attach conditions to City Deal funding granted to UU. January , , devolved government is restored in NI after three years of deadlock. The New Decade, New Approach document which secured that deal vowed to expand university provision at Magee in line with commitments made by the previous Executive, including through the establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School. On January , , a senior official at the Department for the Economy says the business case for overall Magee expansion ‘doesn’t stack up’ and is ‘very out of date’. She explains that the department doesn’t have money for Magee expansion while simultaneously announcing plans to grant UU a poundm bailout for its vastly over-budget Belfast campus. April , , Ulster University confirms that government sign-off is neededthe Medical School is to open as planned in September . At the beginning of May , the DoH states that the business case requires ‘signicant work’ and any decision must have Executive agreement. May , Derry City Deal match funding confirmed bringing the total to poundm. There is renewed optimism that a Medical School will be delivered. On May  The Executive Office assumes responsibility for delivering the Medical School. And on May  Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announces that the Medical School has been approved with a view to opening in September .

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

Those days seem positively idyllic now, but alas, like the car journeys of her childhood, we’re not nearly there yet. The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims. Everywhere is the constant reiteration of the now disproven narrative that the lock up is saving lives. Our politicians vie with one another to virtue signal their intent to prolong the misery and impoverishment of our people, and of future generations. googletag.cmd.push Our elderly are told they are being kept alive, but denied all of the simple pleasures which make le worth living-family, friends, society and their religious practices. Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

Shrouded in darkness on a Friday evening, its charms were not easily advertised, butthe mountain would not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain. But how would south Derry’s teenage prophets get there  “Putting on the Ulsterbuses and all the coaches is what really got it going. They came in fairly quickly and it did the trick,” said current club chairperson Sean McGuigan. “Darragh’s and McLaughlin’s only had maybe four buses and they were a wee bit reluctant to send good buses to the disco. Ulsterbus were a great saviour.” googletag.cmd.push Every Friday evening, a group of hardy bus drivers would set off from towns across Derry, delivering the county’s youth to Slaughtneil hall. It wasn’t for everyone. Pat McGlade, who drove the Draperstown bus for a brief period as the disco was drawing to a close, beat a hasty exit. “I was never at Slaughtneil in my le, I didn’t even know where it was at, but the first night I landed, we got them off and the fighting started,” he said. “I said, ‘JesusI get out of here tonight, I’ll not be back!’. I’d never seen the like of it – they were killing each other that night!” googletag.cmd.push His predecessor, Loup man Sean Glendinning, approached the journey with a little more relish. “They all called me Big Sean for some reason. I wasn’t that big, but I would have gave an odd roar out of me and they sort of listened to me!” he said. “I got on well with them, really. You can’t put old heads on young bodies. You have to be flexible, andyou work with young people, they’ll work with you. “We had no real hassle on the bus, the young people were easy talked to. I gave them a bit of space and they knew how far they could go with you. I never had any hassle. “You’d have got a bit of fighting, but you never passed any remarks on it. It wasn’t too bad, just a bit of a row. “I used to tell the young boys thatthey wanted to box, to go and do it in the ring and earn a bit of money. “The worst bit was whenever the snow was on, you got a bit of a snowballing! There was many a hairy night about it now, but we made it, we got there.” Every night the fleet of drivers was ushered into the club’s kitchen and were wined and dined in traditional GAA style, with plenty of sandwiches, tea and biscuits to be had. “We were well looked after up there,” said Sean. “Once you got there, they took you into the club and Willie Hampson was the main man. You got your tea and all the drivers got a fiver. “You had men from everywhere. The Ulsterbuses came from Kilrea and Dungiven and you had men from all round. Good times and good chat. There was the odd lie told! “The kettle was going and there would be biscuits and a bit of craic. There were four or five in at one time and one or two would have stayed out to keep an eye on the buses.” Willie Hampson is held in high esteem by all the drivers and his hospitality on a Friday night is remembered fondly when they recall the disco. “Willie Hampson looked after the bus drivers and he was some man,” said Colm McGuigan, who started driving the Dungiven bus around . “He used to try and give us all a fiver, but we would have left it all and split it at Christmas time. I would say Slaughtneil got me through twelve Christmases when the weans were young!”  Colm is the current Derry GAA kit man and never tires of reminding the Slaughtneil players of his role in their success. “I used to slag the Slaughtneil men when they came on the Derry team that it was me built their club, bringing all the weans over,” he said. An Ulsterbus employee, he did the school runs by day from Limavady depot, and it was after some pestering from a few of the pupils that the routes to Slaughtneil expanded. “When I started, it was only Dungiven going over to it. They would have gathered at the bus depot and two buses would have left,” said Colm. “A year or so into it, the school weans used to say ‘would you not put a bus on to Slaughtneil ’ “I was in Limavady depot at the time, so I talked to a few of the drivers and we said we’d book a bus ourselves in our own name.” Demand for the bus shot up as hordes of teenagers clamoured for a place every Friday night, but the Troubles still cast a shadow over South Derry in the s and s, and the chances of stumbling on a security checkpoint with an overloaded bus were high. “Some nights there were maybe  weans on the bus, but we were lucky, we were never stopped,” said Colm. “I remember we left Limavady during holiday time with about  in a -seater. Another  or  got on in Drumsurn, another  or  in Ballerin and by that time I was looking down the bus thinking ‘Jesus, how many is in this thing ’ “When I got theof Glenullin, there were  weans standing and I was thinking ‘what am I going to do here ’ “I put the  weans on anyway and they were up in the racks and everywhere, so I said to myself I couldn’t go down onto the main road with these weans. “I had to put the bus into first gear to get it over the top of that hill past the Gaelic pitch and I took it over the back roads into Slaughtneil. “I came back that way and once I got those weans left off in Glenullin, I was happy enough to go down onto the main road again after that!” In order to reduce the potential for mischief on the buses, the GAA club provided bouncers who would travel on the bus with the drivers. Colm generally preferred to police the bus himself and recalls one night in particular when support came from an unlikely corner. “One night I couldn’t get a driver, so I had to drive it myself. This boy got on with a bag of drink,” he said. “Usually you weren’t allowed it, they just poured it down the drain, but this boy was a bit older than the rest of them and had a bag, so I took it off him and told him he’d get it after. “I put it in around the cab. He behaved badly on the way over and I warned him a few times, so coming back again I said, ‘you behave yourself til we get home.’ “He didn’t do so bad until we got theof Drumsurn and he went clean mad again, wrecking and tearing at the back of the bus. “We got to Limavady and he came to me and said, ‘I want my drink’ and I said ‘you’re not getting it, you didn’t behave yourself.’ “He drew out and he hit me and knocked the glasses off me. He had long hair and I managed to grab him, and the next thing was he landed out onto the street. “I looked and the police were sitting in the Landrover. I could see them coming and I thought ‘Jesus I’m in bother.’ “He got up and ran and the policemen chased him. The two cops came down then and askedI was alright andI wanted to press charges. “I said ‘naw you’re alright’ and they said, ‘you did a brave job with him anyway’ and I never heard another word about it.” Despite the odd bit of trouble here and there, Colm is full of praise for the Slaughtneil clubmen who kept things under control. “All the boys that were looking after the disco were pioneers. They were great clubmen and they were never short,” he said. “Even when the younger boys that were going to the disco in the early days, when they got past it they were doing their bit at it too. “It gave them a serious name in those early days, and it put a bit of a push on the other clubs about the county to make their club as financially strong as Slaughtneil.” With his parents’ house being in Maghera, Colm was able to take advantage by dropping in for a visit while the hundreds of teenagers he transported were dancing just a few miles out the road. “Every Friday night I would have reversed the bus up to the side of the house and watched The Late, Late Show with my mother and father,” he said. “You had to rush back to get up before the parents came up in cars. It would take you  or  minutes to get out, but it was well-marshalled and it was a good time for the weans.” The bus drivers who braved the roads leading to Slaughtneil disco kept teenagers dancing in the South Derry hills. They became the trustworthy ferrymen of teenage dreams.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil disco. The Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. googletag.cmd.push “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. googletag.cmd.push “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us. “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Brian Mullins was at the helm when the Anglo Celt Cup last ed to the Oakleaf County in  and Michael McMullan spoke to him about his three years in charge. Reigning champions Dublin led the  All-Ireland semi-final by four points when a loose ball plodded around the middle of Croke Park. Brian Mullins ghosted from behind a ruck. He pulled on the ball with a measured conviction. The Dublin midfielders dink hovered towards Pat Gogarty, under the shadow of the Hogan Stand. His diagonal pass found the unmarked Tony Hanahoe with the Canal End goal in his sights. After dodging two token Derry tackles, Hanahoe roofed the ball unceremoniously to the top corner. John Sommers didnt have a prayer. googletag.cmd.push It was Mullins first taste of Derry. Anthony McGurk was in the opposing corner, on a team managed by the late Frankie Kearney. The three men would unite  years later to take charge of a turbulent Oakleaf ship, following the sacking of Eamonn Coleman and the player strikes that followed Mickey Morans appointment in . Brian tiptoed onto the management circuit, like he did into Dublins team of the seventies. As an -year-old, a son of Kerry and Clare parents, he was selling programmes at the  All-Ireland final, before being called in by supremo Kevin Heffernan the following season, by chance almost. googletag.cmd.push In a bid to bolster his midfield options, Heffo got tipped off about an upcoming Fran Ryder and headed to Belfast for a Thomond Colleges Sigerson Cup clash against the Ranch. It was, however, Ryders colleague and the managers clubmate Mullins who caught the eye. He brought his selectors to watch Brian in action for St Vincents in an U championship clash, where he battered through the opposition defence before scoring a last gasp winning goal. That was it, Mullins was in. There was still a hiccup and he almost missed the All-Ireland final win over Galway. A chipped bone in his foot, sustained in Dublin U action, had Mullins laid up in the Mater hospital, with less than a month to the September showpiece. Heffernan and the chief surgeon had a dference of opinion on Mullins fitness, before the Dubs boss got his way. “A decade in medical school didnt please Kevin,” commented Dublin player Dr Pat ONeill, who was also working in the Mater at the time, in Tom Humphries Dublin v Kerry book. Mullins secured the first of four Celtic Crosses, matching his uncle Bill Casey of Kerry. His career also saw him lose five further finals – all to the Kingdom – and coast to club All-Ireland glory. Heffo, according to Mullins, was a big influence on their squad during that era. “I would have learned a lot from him and hopefully carried those lessons into my own operation,” he offers. “I have been lucky during my late teens and early s...I picked up a lot of what he was about.” In the summer of , Mullins career and le flashed before him in a car crash, on his way from a holiday in Wexford to training in Dublin. He broke his leg and suffered severe head injuries. A testament to his toughness was shaking off a career-threatening injury, thanks to help from Irish Olympian Eamon Coghlan. Mullins restored the muscle in his legs and played in a further three All-Ireland finals, winning one in , a game where he was one of three Dublin players dismissed. Brian was made captain for the  season, but could only look on as Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute delivered a rousing acceptance speech as Gaeilgeafter lting the Sam. It was his last time in the Dublin jersey and when Kevin Heffernan stepped away, he joined Sean Doherty and Robbie Kelleher as a three-man management team to succeed him. Mullins, currently the Director of Sport at UCD, was a qualied PE Teacher from University of Limerick, but never felt management would be something he would have tried his hand at. The trio left the post after a defeat by an emerging Meath team. “There were many other things going on in my le, between owning a business and teaching. Then I moved to Donegal in ,” Mullins points out. He had been running a fitness centre business with another Vins man, Mickey Whelan, he was playing with the club and teaching in Dublin. Mullins was appointed as Principal of Carndonagh Community School, where he lived for nine years and played a bit of club football for the local club. “It was the biggest school in Ireland,” he says. “The school used to compete in all levels at Ulster Schools competitions. There were clubs in all the town on the peninsula, there was a big catchment area.” His next county involvement would come from an unlikely corner. *** He cant put it down to an exact moment, when Derry came calling. Mullins was now rooted in Donegal and managing all aspects of school le was all-consuming. “When the Derry opportunity came up in , it wasnt something I was necessarily thinking of doing,” he recalls. “Managing a county team is something I wasnt preoccupied with,” he added, before giving it some consideration. “I ended up doing the job for three years,” Mullins added. “The squad was already in place, which included most,not all of the All-Ireland squad of .” Brian McGilligan and Tony Scullion would step away during his tenure, with Danny Quinn later taking on a coaching role after helping Harry Gribbinwith the U team. Enda Gormley did begin the   as a trainer. He felt a lethargy, which later transpired to be a blood problem. Once it cleared, Mullins coaxed Enda back to the playing . In the early days, Eugene Young trained the team, with Frankie Kearney and Anthony McGurk as selectors. “Anthony lived in Derry City, so I got in touch with him,” Mullins points out. “We were about the same age. I knew he had been heavily involved with Lavey and thatJohnny was playing. “I wouldnt have spoken to Anthony for  years before I got in contact. I wouldnt necessarily have kept in contact with players I had played against.” With his appointment two or three weeks before the start of the league, Mullins hadnt attended the club championship, having still been playing in Donegal with Carndonagh that summer. “Training went well all through the league. The players enjoyed the games and particularly the win over Donegal in the final,” came his early memories of his first season. Did he feel retaining the league title was a priority  “They had ambition,” he said of the squad. “They wanted to do well and they wanted to win the league in . It was indicative of their ability and their motivation to try and follow on from . “Some of them felt they took their eye off the ball in  and  and they wanted to pick up again.” During our phone conversation, Mullins comes across as a thinker. Every sentence is calm, to the point and absent of background noise. “Fergal McCusker, Anthony Tohill, Henryand Kieran McKeever were there and any amount of them were in their mid-s and felt they had a lot of football in them,” he adds. Reflecting on the litany of names, and with hindsight, winning the league was no surprise. The championship was a dferent kettle of fish he states. After a facile win over Armagh at home, they bowed out to Tyrone in Clones. “The wheels came off...from the high of winning the league final, to two months later being out of the championship and your effort to win an All-Ireland - which is what most teams set out for - was derailed.” Only the front door was in vogue back then, it was another year away from Sam and Derry were no closer. Mullins felt there were no mental scars from a second defeat to their rivals in as many years. “There is no dficulty when you are at that level,” Mullins points out, with a firm tone of voice. “You dont dwell on defeats...apart from aspects you can learn from. It is another effort and another year of doing better than the previous year.” After the  championship defeat, to Tyrones  men, Mullins went at the league in his first season with conviction. Restoring the winning habit was important. “There was some thinking that we peaked too early. In , we tried to put more into the championship.” They didnt qualy for the latter stages of the league and it took a comfortable replay win to see off Monaghan in the first round, to set up Derry versus Tyrone – for the third year in a row. Noel Donnelly thumped home an early goal but it was a  dawn. Joe Cassidy and Joe Brolly notched - between them, with the latter blowing kisses after he slid home his goal and Seamus Downey grabbed a second goal in a hammering of sorts. “We fell foul of Cavan in the final,” Mullins remembers. “In some ways, we thought we got some things right but, on the day, Cavan...they were that little bit ahead of us in terms of delivering on the pitch. We didnt do it.” Jason Reilly did a Ravenelli by pulling his jersey over his head in celebration to mark his th minute goal. Cavan were now ahead. Seconds later Gary McGill had the goal chance, but his shot went straight at goalkeeper Paul ODowd. In the end, Cavan prevailed by the narrowest of margins. Controversy surrounded the victory. They were given a point in the first half that should never have stood. Raymond Cunninghams shot went a foot to the right of the posts. It was something Mullins, surprisingly, didnt and doesnt buy into. “When you are on the sideline and you are involved in a match -the umpire puts up his flag and the referee tots it as a score, thats it, it is a point. “I dont dwell on it. You dwell on the fact you were beaten by a point and wonder where you might have missed scores yourself. “There was a point on the scoreboard, the record shows that and that wouldve been our view coming out of it. On any given day, anything can happen with the opposition that puts them that little bit ahead. It is only learning what you didnt do or what you didnt do enough of, to make sure you made up for it in some way.” *** If Brian Mullins first season was a rushed start, going into  offered more time to scour the county for new players. Clubs were sounded out and recommendations were gathered of the young and emerging talent. “You went with the management team to matches,” he points out. “You looked to see who you could take into the . I am thinking of the likes of Enda Muldoon.” The Ballinderry man was one of six players from the U All-Ireland winning squad to come into the senior scene under the Dublin man. He had handed Sean Marty Lockhart his debut against Kerry at Ballinascreen in the Dublin mans first season. David ONeill and Paul McFlynn came into the defence for , with Joe Cassidy up front and Johnny McBride playing in a number of roles across the middle third. “We would go into each year believing thatwe did all we could and put our best foot forward, the Derry squad would believe they were equal to or better than most in Ulster and , was no dferent” Mullins outlined of this third season. “We were beat by Tyrone in  and by Cavan in , by a very close score, so going into  – why wouldnt you believe. We were happy enough where we were.” Derry lost the league final to Offaly, before hitting three goals in a double scores win over Monaghan in the championship. A semi-final win over Armagh took Derry through to another final, this time a low-scoring scrap with Donegal. “It was fine margins and we were close to losing again in  but we managed to get over the line,” came Mullins initial thoughts of the game. Captain Kieran McKeever didnt give Manus Boyle a snf and Lockharts masterclass on Tony Boyle put him on his way to an all-star later in the year. Even with a man of the match performance from wing-back Paul McFlynn, it looked like a game that was going to squirm away from Derry once again. With  seconds of stoppage time gone and the sides level, McFlynn pounced on a shanked Eoin McCloskey kick-out. As the Loup man scrambled on the ground, Anthony Tohill came in support, before drilling a thunderous delivery over midfield. Substitute Geoffrey McGonigle gained possession. With two Donegal defenders converging, Geoff flicked the ball across to Joe Brolly, who sidestepped Tony Blake before finishing the winning goal. “The fact that Geoffrey was involved in the goal makes it look like a good a decision,” Mullins ponders. “But these things can be seen as going horribly wrong and they can go right.” He was only on the pitch five minutes, but it wasnt a premeditated substitution. “In any circumstances, when you pick your starting , a lot of the time you have subs and decisions to have them as subs or in the starting  is a narrow decision. “We knew Geoffrey had the ability and he wouldve been very close to starting the game and putting him in, we were hopeful and knew he was capable of making a contribution – its as simple as that.” In the semi-final, Derry were convincingly beaten by a Galway team who would again beat them at the penultimate stage in . “That was the end of my three years,” Mullins conceded, while heaping praise on the players, the board and the GAA families during his three seasons. “It was about motivating the players, which wasnt a really dficult thing. They were a great bunch of lads and I would have nothing but praise for them. “That is the thing about sport, there is no guarantee that just because you put in a big effort you are going to end up winning. It is swings and roundabouts, you take the defeats on the chin and you head on into the rest of your le. “I just felt it was time for a change of voice and a change of energy and a change of direction,” he states of his decision to step down. “I had other things, in terms of my work and family, that I needed to put a priority on, and I felt the Derry job needed somebody dferent,” he concluded. Mullins still has family in north Donegal and would sometimes catch up with some of the Derry players of that era. He was in Moyola for Derrys golf day in , to mark  years since winning Sam.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

In this weeks interview with the County Derry Post, the former Derry manager looks back on a tenure that saw him win a league and an Ulster title. He also played down the controversy surrounding Raymond Cunninghams point in the first-half of the  final, a game Cavan won by a point. Mullins has not had any involvement with Dublin since , when the three-man senior management team he was involved withstepped down and is the Director of Sport at UCD. googletag.cmd.push Since Mullins departure from Derry, the county have won two NFLtitles and were on the the cusp of the  All-Ireland final, until Matthew Clancys game-changing goal. Derry went toe to toe with the Dubs in , reached an Ulster final in  with brothers Eoin and Paddy Bradley on the injured list. “I am a bit surprised, given the tradition in the county and the capacity,” answered Mullins of his thoughts on the -year gap. “I know enough about Derry football over the years and it is quite competitive. You have the likes of St Pats Maghera at school and at club level, you have Slaughtneil doing so well. They are all yardsticks of how strong or otherwise the sport is.” googletag.cmd.push “I would have expected that Derry would have popped in there with a team worthy of winning a few of them at one time or a few years of once-off successes.” When asked of the Dublin success, Mullins doesnt claim any credit or kudos for the transformation. Occasionally, Dublin will book their development squad into the facilities at UCD, where is the Director of Sport, but they all have their own management teams. “I have not had any involvement with any Dublin senior, minor of U team since ,” Mullins outlines. “Jack McCaffery, Paul Mannion and others who attended UCD have been on the team but thats as far as it goes.” On the topic of Dublins five in a row, Mullins refers to the high standards that any All-Ireland team brings. He lists Kerry, Mayo and Tyrone as being on the champions coattails, with Dublins consistency and resilience being big factors in the five-in-a-row. “I still think there have been a number of All-Ireland finals in the past while that Dublin were within a hairs breath from losing, it is just that they found the resilience at vital moments that the opposition didnt have.” Donegal were the last Ulster team to win Sam and were close in . Down lost a final to Cork by a point  and Tyrone, with Mickey Hartes men also beaten by Dublin convincingly in . Mullins doesnt feel there is a lot of catching up needed, but Ulster teams need to reassess. “The inidual counties are well-capable of managing and maintaining an effort. In the s, there was Derry, Down and Donegal and eventually Armagh and Tyrone all succeeded to getting to the standard of what was required. “If they could do it in the s and early s, they might have to go back, as you might say, to a drawing board...but it shows they are well capable of doing it.” RELATED - Rory Gallagher feels Derry can take advantage of lockdown.

In time and when the Covid- outbreak is contained sufficiently, focus will sht on to step  which will be an extended YELLOW Phase when both outdoor and indoor sport activity would take place in larger groups, up to  people. The next progression would be to a GREEN phase which would lead to full training and competition across sports in line within general PHA guidelines that exist at the time, a re-opening of leisure centres and spectators able to attend live sporting events in restricted numbers. googletag.cmd.push Completion of each phase will represent a key milestone in the progression towards the resumption of sport and physical recreation in Northern Ireland.

It provides for all sports, including outdoor recreation, from grassroots level to high performance sport andprofessional athletes.

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Second past the judge Iain Duff was Supersat, ridden by Leo Gracey, with James McGurgen third on John Megawrsquos Gortmerron Lady.Mark is now the only local amateur to have ridden out his racecourse riders claim.The First Trust Maiden race was ided and in the first ision Jackie Kidd from Loughinisland won on Tullamore, owned and trained by her father, Mayne, beating Brian Dougan on his own Russell Lodge, with Jimmy Henry third on Redheadmustgo.The winner of the second ision was Cortynan in the colours of Dr Fitz Gillespie, who sadly passed away recently.This one providing Glyne Dyne with his third career success. Bend in the River was second ahead of Crawfordstowncross, with Jimmy Henry in the saddle.In the Ulster Bank Open race Liam Lennon had his first winner of the day as a trainer when Younowhat, which he also rode, won in the colours of Moirarsquos Jim McMullan.He also saddled the runner-up, Patsy Murphyrsquos Blackout, ridden by Mark OrsquoHare. Glencloy was third.The W  C Glazing Ltd two winner race saw Banbridge rider James Smyth record his first success of the season when successful on Supreme Lancer, in the colours of Mrs Carol Rooney from Newry.

As part of the Marathon Potential  cohort, I attended a two week training camp near Torre-Vieja, Spain, organised jointly by Athletics Northern Ireland and Athletics Ireland.I had the honour of going toe-to-toe with then NI marathon record holder, Paul Pollock, on the track.I also had the opportunity to spend time with Paul off-track, alongside Kevin Seaward, learning from two powerhouses of Irish marathon running and building on the advice we received from Stephen Scullion, in Belfast in early December.Most importantly, I made lasting friendships with my fellow Marathon Potential  athletes. The sense of community allowed me to really embrace the project.Setting a goal of putting two of us on the start line of the  Paris Olympics is very ambitious. As a younger athlete, I always felt like an underdog.This feeling, which I once perceived as a negative, has become one of my chief strengths. The goal of becoming an Olympian, which I have chased mdash still chasing mdash from an early age, has, at times seemed unattainable.However, as time has passed, I have grown to love the chase. I look forward to the next stage on this journey, in the company of the Marathon Potential  athletes and support staff, under the stewardship of my coach and mentor of  years, Richard Rodgers, and the band of local training partners.Our way of le has changed dramatically in the space of four months due to COVID-. I remember reading the news in January and having the unnerving feeling that it would not be the last time that I would do so.When I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe. By mid March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time.My biggest mdash and somewhat selfish mdash fear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run.To those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.As a PhD student I do not consider myself a key worker. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part. Double runs mdash two runs a day mdash have always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon.Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.Yes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training mdash  years and counting. So we have to love the training too. A consequence of this has been that I have begun to pay attention to the finer details in training.When doing a hard workout, I set high standards for each and every repetition, be it focusing on my running form, my cadence or my composure in a strong headwind. I have been trying out new drills and core routines to break up the days.Beyond training itself, I have found myself looking after my kit better than I may have done in the past. This, strangely enough, has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my day.Given the recent stint of unusually sunny and warmer April weather, I have been leaving my shoes to dry in the sun after runs. A friend recently told me that this is a standard practice in Japan, harnessing the heat of the sun to kill off microbes.It has become a bit of a ritual for me. My shoes fairly pound the roads, so I guess they deserve some respect for what they allow me to do. Seeing them propped against the wall lts my spirits.I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to have run the Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon, but your chance to do so will come around again in September or the future.Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness.More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months. It is directly transferable to enduring the current crisis.I remember passing the -mile mark in the  Dublin Marathon. I was in a world of pain mdash itrsquos worth it when yoursquore on track for : mdash when I passed a sign that read lsquoWhat wall rsquoI knew then that I would be coming back to this distance time and again. Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef stars in Great British Menu final  ","story":"CHEF Alex Greene narrowly missed out on being crowned Champion of Champions at the Great British Menu banquet to honour  years of childrenrsquos literature.The Dundrum man admitted he was ldquogutted at not securing the final accolade for the best dish at the event ndash despite becoming the second chef to have got two dishes through to the final and the only Northern Ireland finalist ever to have done it.He lost out to double Michelin-starred chef Niall Keating whose fish dish was voted the best by the  diners, who included Alexrsquos mother, Glynis, his employer, Michael Deane, and Michaelrsquos we, former UTV presenter Kate Smith.However, he was being feted by local fans and well-wishers after the show came to an end on BBC on Friday night.The highly competitive  year-old wowed judges and guests with his starter and desert dishes - a potato and cheese sauce based dish inspired by CS Lewisrsquo book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and a coconut and chocolate ganache dessert with edible rice pages and covers presented as a book inspired by Oliver Jeffersrsquo book, The Incredible Book Eating Boy.The event was held in early February, so Alex, who started his career off in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village, has had some time to reflect on his success.ldquoIrsquove been overwhelmed by the response Irsquove had from people on social media itrsquos been just mental, he said.ldquoItrsquos another achievement for me and itrsquos something I wanted to do for a long time. To get one dish is big, to get two dishes to the banquet is major as itrsquos only happened twice before and never for someone from Northern Ireland.ldquoAlthough I think everyone was shocked that I didnrsquot get Champion of Champions. A producer came afterwards to ask me how I felt about it and even Niall didnrsquot think he would get it.ldquoI was gutted to be honest. It couldnrsquot have been any closer and I did feel it after all the hard work I put into it. While I enjoyed the whole experience, I do regret not getting Champion of Champions. To me, not to get the whole thing, particularly after coming so far, was tough and hard to stomach. Itrsquos hard when I know the amount of effort I put in and then to get so close. But I know that I couldnrsquot had done anymore.Alex revealed that he worked seven days a week on perfecting his menu dishes for four months while maintaining his demanding job as chef at the Michelin-starred EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, the fine dining experience of the Michael Deane group, where he has worked for the last three years.ldquoWe started filming last November and I was working in the kitchen at Deanes every day, and even on Sundays when Irsquom normally off. The guys at work and Michael were absolutely amazing with their support as well as the local guys who produced the props for me, said Alex.Viewers saw that all the chefs were up against it at the banquet as they had to do all their own food preparation with the work being doubled for AlexldquoIt was a hard couple of days and it wasnrsquot all fun and games.

He also raised concern that a commitment to pay staff for the days they went on strike last December has not been delivered.In a detailed response mdash issued after last weekrsquos production deadline had passed ndash the South Eastern Trust said while the Covid- outbreak appeared to have reached a plateau within its hospitals, ldquothe incidents and challenges within the care sector continue to increase and the organisation is currently some distance from being able toto business as usual.The statement continues: ldquoWe are now considering a recovery plan for our elective, cancer and all other key services. This will include the services we can safely restore and by when.ldquoThere is also a global supply issue regarding anaesthetic, opioid and other medications.The shortage of these medications, amongst others, will have an impact on what services we can restore and how quickly.ldquoRoyal College guidelines for surgical specialities and endoscopy currently advise risk assessment and only performing very urgent procedures. This is due to the risk to the staff and also the patient attending hospital.ldquoThis is signicantly limiting the level of endoscopy we can carry out at this time. There are no plans to cease the reprocessing and maintenance of the endoscopy equipment in the Downe day procedure unit.The health trust insists that it is required to agree any recovery plan regionally to ensure equitable provision, explaining the bowel screening programme Mr Hazzard refers to has been suspended across Northern Ireland.ldquoOur priority will continue to be the safety of our patients and staff whilst we do this, said the health trust.ldquoThere is an ongoing requirement for additional staffing from across the organisation within the emergency departments at the Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals which continue to have signicant and rising numbers of patients attending.ldquoBoth EDs have been separated into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces. The safe separation of patients requires the support of more staff, helping to reduce the likelihood of cross infection and facilitates the requirement for social distancing.The health trust says there is also a requirement to separate inpatient wards into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces at the Ulster, Lagan Valley and Downe hospitals which requires the support of more staff.ldquoUnfortunately, the Trust is also experiencing signicant numbers of staff absences at present. The reasons include self-isolation due to symptoms and shielding of vulnerable persons. This includes a high number of staff who work in the day procedure unit in the Downe Hospital, the statement continues.ldquoIn addition, we continue to work with colleagues in primary care, including the independent sector where there is an ongoing high level of pressure as a result of the virus.ldquoIn some cases, our staff have been providing care and support to the nursing and residential homes in the locality where the need is most acute. Supporting our colleagues within the care sector and the most vulnerable in our society is an absolute priority.The health trust insists that a commitment to pay staff travel time between the Downe and Ulster hospitals has not been rescinded and that eligible staff will receive a payment in lieu of travel time.In relation to strike pay, the Trust said Stormont health minister Robin Swann gave a commitment that pay deducted as a result of industrial action would be reinstated, with payments from the Business Services Organisation delayed as a result of Covid-.

These protocols will help advise any future science-led coastal management approaches we may adopt for protecting these vulnerable environments.Gina McIntyre, CEO of the Special EU Programmes Body, said the research being carried out will provide invaluable data to help protect Murlough Bay for many years to come.ldquoIt is one of the key environmental protection projects that will lead to better, more sustainable, marine conservation activities across Northern Ireland, Ireland and Western Scotland, she said.Dr Melanie Biausque, who can often be seen surveying the beach at low tide using a quad bike, explained what is done with the collected data.ldquoWe visit the site every month and for the next few years this will help generate a visualisation of surface height changes on the beach, telling us how waves move sand around under dferent wave events, she said.ldquoThese are incorporated in a computer model that should allow us to see how future storms will react with the underlying sandy seabed and beach.Another Ulster University researcher, Dr Edoardo Grottoli, has also been collating information of past changes of the coastal system in Murlough Bay using historical maps, past aerial photography and historical accounts of storm impact.He said: ldquoPast events will show us to better understand how important patterns of change have unfolded through time and how the coastline is evolving to present and future positions.ldquoSociety needs to understand the movement of the coast and the processes that drive the changes in order to protect our marine environment in the longer term..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Supporters Club.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

William Whitelaw, whose failure as secretary of state for Northern Ireland to sign the order to intern Gerry Adams led to last week’s Supreme Court ruling, was the very man who was bound to have concurred with the flight to London of Adams and Martin McGuinness in  to meet British officials. Interestingly Adams and McGuinness thereafter quickly climbed the heights of Sinn Fein. . William Whitelaw is reported to have discussed Father Chesney, the priest alleged to have played a role in the IRA Claudy bomb, with the Roman Catholic cardinal before Father Chesney was allowed to escape to Donegal and avoided arrest.. Mr Ringland’s claim of the fairness of British justice system, as evident he says in the Gerry Adams Supreme Court decision, seems to me to be at odds with his comment later “the unbalanced way the narrative of the Troubles is being reshaped in our courts”.. One of the greatest travesties of the judicial system was the release in the s by the then lord chief justice of all those convicted on supergrass evidence. The QC, now deceased, who represented most of the accused was an old friend of mine, and he made it clear to me that at the appeals he did not have to kick the door open for an acquittal.

It was so emotional being able to see the nurses on the Covid ward.ldquoFor me and Charlotte it was very humbling because those guys are putting their lives at risk and theyrsquore asking for stuff for patients, not for themselves.ldquoWe were quite tearful because we didnrsquot want to leave them there ndash but theyrsquore doing it day in-day out without batting an eyelid. Amazing people.Alongside their charitable work, Matthew and Charlotte have adapted to the challenging economic climate by introducing a delivery service for their customers.The pair have been working without the support of their staff who they had to furlough after the government closed all non-essential shops.ldquoWersquove started doing take-out because we canrsquot afford to do nothing for three months. Wersquoll lose the shop, said Matthew.ldquoWersquoll continue to do these drop offs for the hospital as long as people fund it, and wersquoll continue to do our take-out service.ldquoBecause for shops and restaurants I think its going to be long term.ldquoWe might be in this for six months before we can open to the public.ldquoAs long as we get the support and people keep shopping locally, then yes we can get through it.ldquoRunning a business is a constant challenge and you donrsquot ever stop having to adapt. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

under  had % less chance of being infected.However, evidence on how likely children are to transmit Covid- remains ldquoinconclusive, according to the scientic advice used to inform the proposals to reopen schools.And teachers do not appear to be at a greater risk of catching Covid- than other professions ndash but there is still some riskschools reopen, scientic advisers said.The evidence was released as figures showed that the reproductive rate of coronavirus has remained the same for a second week ndash and ministers came under sustained criticism from some scientists over their handling of the crisis.Nobel Prize-winning scientist Sir Paul Nurse said the Government had been ldquotoo much on the back foot while Sir Ian Boyd, a member of Sage, said acting earlier would have ldquomade quite a big dference to the death rate.They spoke as the number of deaths involving Covid- in the UK passed ,, according to the latest available data. vw,vw,px, px\"The so-called R-number ndash the

spread of the virus in care homes and hospitals during the period covered rather than the wider community.Keeping the R number below  is a key goal Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set to allow the

this crisis to protect and ensure the delivery of our basic services but like many other councils at this time, the future of these essential services such as bin collections, burials and street

disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemeteryservices.“The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring out health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities.“This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time.“It will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.”While the additional funding is welcomed, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon

must look at longer term investment to support the financial resilience of our councils so that we are resourced to deliver on strategies for bespoke economic recovery and community support.“Councils
