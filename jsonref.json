When my mum picked him up in the afternoon, he said mummy was crying this morning because her eyes are hurting I think.\u0027Ms Taylor said she didn\u0027t believe modern medicine was always the right treatment and often deterred from it.But after hearing she may lose her sight forever if she didn\u0027t have the steroid, prednisone, she decided to take it.\u0027I was initially quite torn and thought I wasn\u0027t going to take (the steroids) until it was quite bad, and then I thought yeah I should take it,\u0027 she said.On returning to the specialist, Ms Taylor was diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica, a branch off the debilitating disease multiple sclerosis.\u0027It was scary because the worst case is I could also be wheelchair bound or if it gets worse I could go blind or paralysed,\u0027 she said. Ms Taylor has now regained 80 per cent of her sight back and has taken a break from her work as a life coach.She said she is hoping to start work again in March but will spend the summer with her son and partner.\u0027I felt like my eyesight went because I couldn\u0027t see what was right in front of me,\u0027 she said.\u0027Now I\u0027m feeling back to normal, I don\u0027t want to push myself any further.\u0027         After spending a month in darkness, Ms Taylor finally regained 80 per cent of her eyesight back and plans to spend the summer with her son Phoenix  "},{"url":null,"title":"Mates Serena Dusty plan Melbourne meet","story":"Share this article \u0027He\u0027s friends with one of my best friends and they were there and he was there,\u0027 Williams explained.\u0027He\u0027s super athletic.

This is where your body is struggling to deal with blood sugar levels, and it is a very clear sign that you are about to develop full-blown type 2 diabetes.I didn’t have any symptoms of diabetes (such as excessive thirst or blurred vision), but my blood sugar levels were far too high.My GP put me on metformin tablets and drugs to control my blood pressure. I was also probably advised to lose a bit of weight. But even then I didn’t listen. It was only when I first met Roy that I finally took notice.         Tucking in: Dave in 2009, eating fish and chips, before he started the diet plan. He said losing weight had reversed his slide into diabetesWe met eight years ago when he was invited to join our TV series as an expert. He took one look at me and my co‑Hairy Biker Simon King and said: ‘You’re both morbidly obese.’It was great TV and the impetus we needed to launch the series in 2012.But what the viewers never got to see was the behind-the-scenes support he gave me. He made it clear that I was looking down the barrel of a gun, and diabetes was one disease I seriously needed to avoid at any cost.Then, off camera one day, he quietly took me aside and told me if I lost weight I could reverse the pre-diabetic state, get off the drugs and effectively protect myself against getting full-blown diabetes.         Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby with The Hairy Bikers Dave Myers and Simon King on December 3I was shocked, but intrigued.This was pretty revolutionary news at the time and it was something I was keen to try.From that point on I worshipped at the altar of Professor Taylor. It wasn’t always easy, particularly when you’re working with Michelin-starred chefs asking you to taste their exquisite mashed potato which basically wipes out your entire daily calorie allowance in one mouthful.Luckily the weight dropped off pretty fast, and within three months I’d shifted more than 3 st (from 114 kg to 95 kg) and Si’s weight dropped by nearly 4 st.         Hairy Biker Dave Myers has undergone a dramatic weight transformation. He said one of his key pieces of advice from Professor Roy is to aim to stay as close as you can to the weight you were when you were 21We felt great, but I noticed the impact first on my blood pressure, which was falling so low I’d end up feeling dizzy when exercising.Just two months into the experiment, Roy advised me to stop taking my diabetes tablets and to come off my blood pressure pills because I’d clearly lost enough weight that my organs were beginning to function normally again. That was a real thrill.Roy’s diagnosis was confirmed at a check-up six months after I started losing weight, when tests showed my blood sugar levels were smack‑bang in the normal category. Just as Roy predicted, losing weight had reversed my slide into diabetes.I’ve worked hard to maintain that weight loss and I’ve had my blood sugar levels tested every six months for the past seven years and the results have remained normal.One of Roy’s most important pieces of advice is that if you want to avoid diabetes, you should aim to stay as close as you can to the weight you were when you were 21.Sadly, I never did get back to the 34 in waist of my youth. But I managed a 36 in waist . . . which wasn’t bad from a starting point of 49 in.I’m still in contact with Roy and he says I could improve my health even further if I lose another 2 st.I might have laughed at the idea a few years ago, but I’m 62 now so I might make a concerted effort to shift that extra weight this spring.        "},{"url":null,"title":"Racism drove Meghan Markle Britain say prominent black Britons","story":"Share this article The Huffington Post published an article headlined ‘Why Black People Think Racism Drove Meghan And Harry To Quit The Royal Family’, while in The New York Times, Afua Hirsch, an author on race, said Meghan’s treatment showed that however successful you are in Britain ‘racism will follow you’.But Trevor Phillips, former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said it was ‘nonsense’ to suggest the couple were leaving ‘because of racism’.

He feared she\u0027d allow herself to be seduced by fellow cast member John Leyton, who\u0027d had a No 1 hit in 1961 with Johnny Remember Me.Sellers phoned Britt long- distance from Hollywood: \u0027Why don\u0027t you take the day off and come over?\u0027 He assured her he\u0027d clear all this with her producers, he was well connected — and he\u0027d worked twice with Batasi\u0027s director, John Guillermin, on the feature films Never Let Go and Waltz Of The Toreadors.This was bluster. Sellers said nothing to any producer, and Britt later felt she\u0027d been more or less abducted: \u0027He made sure I didn\u0027t go back.\u0027 Her role was re-shot with Mia Farrow. The litigation lasted years, Sellers countersuing 20th Century Fox for \u0027mental distress and injury to his health\u0027.         The couple pictured together in 1965. The compliant, cosy, deferential scene was undermined somewhat by Sellers\u0027s feelings of morbid jealousy — and by the couple\u0027s instant separationMeanwhile, to make himself extra-virile in bed, Sellers, aged not quite 40, was taking ampoules of amyl nitrate, or poppers, which disrupted his metabolism — and on April 7, 1964, he suffered a series of heart attacks.Billy Wilder, who had not hit it off with his star, commented: \u0027Heart attack? Heart attack? You\u0027ve got to have a heart before you can have an attack!\u0027 Sellers was replaced by American actor Ray Walston, the footage all re-done, and Kiss Me, Stupid was a huge flop.Back at Elstead, it was Britt\u0027s job to see Sellers through his convalescence, and to administer his complex cardiological medication.He was an ungrateful invalid. When he found out Britt was pregnant, Sellers said: \u0027I\u0027ve got Michael, I\u0027ve got Sarah. I don\u0027t want any more children.\u0027 Director Bryan Forbes and Nanette Newman, his actress wife, had to talk him out of insisting Britt had an abortion.When she went into labour with Victoria in January 1965, he dumped her on the pavement outside the Welbeck Street Clinic and whizzed off to make What\u0027s New Pussycat. When Britt eventually visited him on the set, she blotted her copybook by mistaking Sellers for Woody Allen — there was a physical similarity, which Sellers found irksome.When he was again mistaken for Woody, by a Hollywood mogul during the making of Casino Royale in 1967, he was next heard from in Sweden. Sellers had gone into hiding with Britt\u0027s parents and refused to return to the film.Sellers was incredibly mischievous in his off-screen life, too.At Elstead, where Britt was sometimes so bored that she\u0027d spend an evening gazing at her reflection in the polished marble of the fireplace, the pair would dine on frozen cottage pie and fish fingers, served by a butler.When Goons fan Prince Charles came to lunch, Sellers hadn\u0027t made provision for his bodyguards, and told the cook to ide His Royal Highness\u0027s portion among his entourage — Charles was surprised to receive an eyeful of food. \u0027Sheer insanity,\u0027 said Spike Milligan.Sellers and Britt made home movies with Lord Snowdon and Princess Margaret — and Sellers asked Snowdon if he\u0027d like to swap wives. Sellers had to settle for a new camera lens instead, and Snowdon got a speedboat in return.Sellers also asked Bryan Forbes if Nanette could be exchanged for Britt, but Forbes managed to laugh off the suggestion.That such a crazy scheme could be broached indicates all was not well. \u0027Being with Peter was like riding on a rollercoaster,\u0027 remembered Britt. \u0027One minute you were flying high, the next you were running low.\u0027Nothing came lower than his doomed efforts to turn her into his one big impossible love, Italian film star Sophia Loren.In 1967, Sellers and Britt went to Rome to make The Bobo, in which he was a singing matador and she was to be a seductress. He insisted she wear a black wig, like Loren\u0027s. This was ridiculous but he couldn\u0027t see it.\u0027You\u0027re a lousy bloody actress,\u0027 he told her. \u0027Why don\u0027t you listen to what I tell you?\u0027 Not exactly morale-boosting comments — which began to be backed up with violence.He stamped on Britt\u0027s wedding ring so often that Garrard, the Queen\u0027s jewellers, got used to having to fix it. He threatened her with a shotgun, ripped up her clothes, smashed her cassette player and carefully took apart her Cartier watch, flushing the cogs down the lavatory.He also chucked her out of hotels — and when her parents came from Stockholm to rescue her after a flare-up on the island of Ischia, he didn\u0027t like to hear them babbling in Swedish, as he felt excluded.Sellers threw her luggage off his yacht, and Bert Mortimer was for ever having to gather up her personal effects. \u0027Our marriage is finished!\u0027 Sellers would cry.Britt fought back, once bashing him over the head with a picture frame. \u0027You hit me with me mum,\u0027 he said, when he saw the cherished photo of Peg on the floor.They were orced in 1968, Britt citing Sellers\u0027s psychological cruelty. He carried on getting married and orced, treating women like cars or cameras, accessories he could replace without compunction when he was fed up.For all his craziness, however, there has not been a comic actor to touch him.From the The Goon Show to Ealing classics, Boulting Brothers films, work with Stanley Kubrick, Inspector Clouseau, all the way to Being There, Sellers remains a comic genius and it doesn\u0027t much matter any more that he was a mean-spirited egomaniac.As for Britt, she became a Bond girl, and starred in Get Carter and The Wicker Man. In Scandal, she is to be glimpsed on a sofa, with tassels on her nipples.She had a long relationship with Rod Stewart and a shorter one with Warren Beatty. In 1996, she auctioned off her memorabilia at Christie\u0027s — including the wedding dress from her marriage to Sellers and the come-hither Polaroids he took on the night they met.\u0027I wanted to get rid of it all,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m so tired of that sexy, cute little sex kitten, the youthful Britt.\u0027 I can sympathise with that.ROGER LEWIS\u0027S book The Life And Death Of Peter Sellers was made into a Golden Globe and Emmy award-winning film by HBO, where Sellers is played by Geoffrey Rush and Britt Ekland by Charlize Theron."},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markle signs voiceover deal Disney return donation elephant charity","story":"Share this article The royal couple met with representatives from organisations doing ground-breaking work in the areas of conservation and the environment.Prince Harry has taken a keen interest in African conservation projects over the years and in 2017 he became the president of African Parks. Harry and Meghan: Voiceover deal with Disney hints at future career path | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/01/11/01/23259838-0-image-m-38_1578706234569.jpg","title":"Prince Harry time securing best financial deal family","story":"Share this articlePrince Harry prepared to wait to get the best deal for his family\u0027s futureUrgent talks continue to resolve Harry and Meghan crisis | UK news | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Woman McDonalds life finding SPIDER baked cheeseburger bun","story":"Share this article \u0027I am absolutely disgusted that a company that is so well known, so big and that caters for children - and adults - did not notice the big dead spider on the side of the bun.

She is very good at it. Everyone involved with her initiative at Smart Works, a small charity that helps disadvantaged women get into the workplace, was immensely impressed by her input. Her contribution went well beyond making a token appearance and showing an interest. She came up with the idea of designing and selling product to raise funds and profile and gave an inspiring speech without notes at the launch.This is a woman who knows what she can achieve and what she is worth. As Meghan Markle, B-list actress in a successful TV series, that calculation was relatively straightforward.         One of the aspects of Royal life Meghan will have found most difficult is not being allowed to voice an opinion, writes ALEXANDRA SHULMAN (Meghan during her and Harry\u0027s secret visit to the Hubb Community Kitchen in west London)For Harry, as Duke of Sussex and sixth in line to the British throne, there was similar clarity. But as second-tier Royals roaming the world on the speaker circuit, making red-carpet appearances, endorsing products and occasionally appearing on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, the rules of engagement become very murky. Right now the Sussexes are hot.Meghan is beautiful and impassioned. Harry still dashing and a frontline Royal. Things change. In the world of celebrity, you are always having to watch out for the new kid on the block. Fame is a greedy beast that has to be continually fed.Until now, their working life of Royal tours, walkabouts, visiting disaster zones and being guests of honour at charity events has automatically fuelled and burnished their profile. But without the very special imprimatur of first-tier Royalty, the kind of power and influence they currently enjoy may not survive in the long term – especially if they are cashing them in to gain financial independence.The celebrity circuit is complex and quite brutal. If you become known as an easy gun for hire to the highest bidder, in a short time your currency drops. You can spend a few years giving hugely lucrative speeches for international hedge-fund dinners, and being on the advisory board of a bioersity start-up in Qatar, but to give this existence longevity you have to keep replenishing your worth – whether that is in the degree of your fame or in exceptional talent or knowledge.         Meghan is beautiful and impassioned. Harry still dashing and a frontline Royal, writes ALEXANDRA SHULMAN (Meghan and Harry during their secret visit to the Hubb Community Kitchen in west London)Unanchored celebrity has a built-in obsolescence. It’s hard to understand why they are swapping a profile that confers automatic and eternal worldwide fame for one where your worth will be in part measured by your number of Instagram followers and dependent on the skill of your marketing team.This kind of celebrity is also reliant on exposure, and not simply the exposure that you selectively chose to put out on your own social media sites. The relentless commentary of media of every kind is part of the deal and, if anything, the Sussexes may well be less protected in this new world than they felt in their old. Every move they make will be analysed and scrutinised and if they are being paid handsomely for it, they will no doubt be regarded as fair game.This weekend Meghan is back in Canada with her son while Harry is at home hammering out the details of their future. I hope he has some time out and manages to catch up with old friends.The couple are no doubt exhilarated by having made the decision to cut loose and get their plans out in the open. Almost certainly, they will be looking at the future and see it glittering with opportunity. Which it could be. If they don’t take their position for granted.But if they are hoping to build a new life that trades on royalty without fulfilling the more difficult obligations that come with it, which is reliant on the toxic mirage of fame without worth, not that many years down the line they could be looking at a very different picture."},{"url":null,"title":"The vicious rivalry Meghan Markle Kate Middleton super fans","story":"Share this article ‘The QUEEN is also off limits as are the York girls.’On the other side, there is equal vehemence.

Duchess Do Little envies Meghan.’Those who back Kate have treated the news of Harry and Meghan’s decision to step back from Royal duties as a gross act of betrayal. ‘SPOILT BRATS,’ one shrieked.

They view the decision as empowering, an Independence Day for the couple – a sign, perhaps, of The Sussex Squad’s more transatlantic community. ‘It’s a huge decision,’ says one fan, addressing the couple. ‘But you are both strong enough to follow your dreams and I admire your choice.’Bella, 20, from Liverpool, who runs Instagram accounts dedicated to both Royal women, says drawing comparisons ‘comes with the territory’. ‘Her Majesty and Princess Margaret were always compared, as were Fergie and Diana and even Pippa and Kate,’ she said.‘The fact that Kate and Meghan are both beautiful, intelligent women doesn’t help, as people always want to criticise everything they do and say.

Others have the roof of the vehicle studded with more than a 1,000 LED lights recreating the sky at night – complete with shooting stars.Another ultra-rich car fanatic paid an extra £250,000 for a Rolls-Royce Ghost to be sprayed in paint containing 1,000 crushed diamonds, quite an upgrade for a vehicle with a base price of £237,600 on the car company’s price list.The paint has been named Diamond Stardust, and a spare tin of it is being kept in a safe at Rolls-Royce headquarters in Goodwood, Sussex, in case the owner suffers a ding.The costs of bespoke cars, which can take a team of designers and engineers years to create, easily run into the millions and one two-seater Rolls-Royce coupe cost “double digit millions”. More than 100 craftspeople work on Roll-Royce’s bespoke vehicle service at its Goodwood plant.“Everything that you can think about that’s not illegal, it is possible to do,” Torsten Müller-Ötvös, chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, said. “People have worked hard to make their money, and this is about allowing them to create their personal dream.“We are not in the car market,” he said as he showed the  some of the company’s latest models in a yet-to-open showroom in Mayfair, London.“This sounds funny what I’m saying but we are in the luxury goods market. And this market has very different customer patterns and behaviours.“Nobody chooses us to get an object to go from A to B it is very much about fulfilling a personal dream, commissioning a piece of art. Having something sitting in your garage waiting for you providing pleasure over the weekends or whenever you want to take it out for a drive.”Müller-Ötvös said nearly all Rolls-Royces are now bespoke creations, and the pricey personalisations have driven the brand to record sales of 5,152 cars last year.Müller-Ötvös said Rolls-Royce is ditching its stuffy image and appealing to younger members of the wealthy elite with a range of “darker more menacing edgier black badge” models.More than 1,000 members of the super-rich visited Rolls-Royce’s headquarter last year to talk to the bespoke service team.“There are engineers, designers, craftspeople. Bespoke is an integral part of why Rolls-Royce exists,” Müller-Ötvös said.“We are weaving nearly 1,400 fibre optics into the roof of the interior that resembles stars at night. We are doing that even with your private constellation and even shooting stars at the request of our clients. We also have humidors.”A visit to Rolls-Royce’s rose garden inspired Swedish billionaire Ayad al-Saffar to ask the team to decorate the interior of his new car with flowers and butterflies. More than 1m embroidered satin stitches were needed to create the fantasy rose garden interior with an entanglement of greenery, flowers, and butterflies.The Phantom Rose used in the design was created exclusively for Rolls-Royce by the British rose breeder Philip Harkness, and can only be found in the firm’s gardens.One customer had the bespoke team stumped: he wanted his car to be more shiny than metal. Rolls-Royce technical laboratories came up with the idea of grinding down 1,000 “ethically sourced” diamonds into dust and mixing them into the paint.“Customers will say ‘I bet you can’t achieve this’ and it sets the challenge for us,” one of the designers said. “Projects like this are an impetus to try new things.”Müller-Ötvös also jets around the world to visit clients in their homes and garages to see their current car collections and work with them to create their next car.“I have seen garages with over 100 cars” he said. “For many of our clients, they have garages for their cars like we have wardrobes for our clothes. For every occasion and for every purpose they have the right car.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0059adeb88907b985cb92903ee176e9d8a8e4a85/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8760c7c7ad6785f1fe64c70555cce29e","title":"gambling watchdog plans ban online credit card bets","story":"Rising concern for vulnerable customers prompts potential move by Gambling CommissionThe gambling industry watchdog is preparing to ban bookmakers from taking credit card deposits for betting online, in the latest move to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable customers.The Gambling Commission is expected to announce the long-awaited ban on credit card wagers, with the rules due to be unveiled as soon as Tuesday. Well-placed sources said an announcement by the regulator was imminent. It comes two years after charity groups such as GambleAware and Citizens Advice urged the government to implement the policy to protect people from sliding into gambling addiction.Major betting websites including PokerStars, Betfair, 888 and Bet365 all currently allow their customers to make deposits online using credit cards, which has led to warnings from campaigners that gamblers risk racking up huge debts.Last year, the  reported on the case of a problem gambler who used nine credit cards to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds with online casinos, who she claimed ignored her obvious signs of a spiralling addiction. Her losses include one of £54,000 in an overnight spree when she was allowed to place bets worth more than £380,000 on one website in a single session.The regulator is expected to unveil a full ban on credit cards being used for online gambling accounts. Customers will be limited to using their debit cards to prevent them from overextending themselves.The consultation that led to the commission’s decision included e-wallets, indicating that payment services such as PayPal will probably be included in the ban.  revealed last year that such providers had allowed problem gamblers to circumvent banking limits and spend up to £150,000 a day.In addition to the credit card crackdown, the commission is also preparing to announce that membership of GamStop will become a condition of online casinos’ licence to operate. GamStop allows people who want to block themselves from gambling voluntarily to give their details, which are then shared to prevent them from opening new accounts elsewhere. The system is designed to spot attempts to fool it, such as by using pseudonyms.The commission’s approval of GamStop means any bookmaker or online casino that wants to operate in the UK will have to sign up to the scheme. The regulator had held off from approving the scheme until now, amid concern that it could not guarantee that people registered to it would not also be sent marketing material encouraging them to bet.The move indicates the regulator is finally satisfied that GamStop is effective, coming after years of delays beyond its original launch date in 2017 amid criticism that it was ineffective at barring addicts from placing bets.A ban on gambling on credit has been Labour policy since September 2018, after mounting support from MPs across the political ide to prevent gambling firms from exploiting vulnerable customers.The regulator’s latest interventions come amid mounting expectations that the government will begin the process of drawing up a new Gambling Act to replace the one passed by Tony Blair’s government in 2005, which has been criticised for dramatically reducing regulation.The industry’s reputation has taken further blows in recent weeks after revelations about its reliance on so-called VIPs making heavy losses, and concerns about a commercial deal with the Football Association to live-stream FA Cup games. The £750m deal to provide seven bookmakers with exclusive rights to screen some fixtures sparked an outcry – leading the FA to agree that matches would be shown elsewhere, too.The Gambling Commission and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport both declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b7db4a8e190384b6c79b477e518d3455120ccbb/0_187_3799_2280/master/3799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecfa89055378a59251b7772ede5fd526","title":"lost seat parliament westminster britain working class","story":"If two years in Westminster taught me anything, it’s that the privileged few still decide the future of Britain’s working classWhat a difference a year makes. At the end of 2018 I had just won an MP of the Year award – by New Year’s Eve 2019, I had lost a job that I loved. A week to pack up the parliamentary office, up to two months to wind up the constituency office, and then the absolute worst part: making my amazing staff redundant.You can’t get away from the instability of politics. Democracy rightly gives us the ability to remove politicians from positions of power. In a marginal seat such as mine – Crewe and Nantwich – the situation was always going to be more precarious.There is a common misconception that all MPs have bags of money and receive huge payoffs if they lose their seat. Like many colleagues who lost their seats, I don’t have a family fortune or lots of friends in high places. When I attended an appointment at my local jobcentre last week, a few people were shocked to see me there. One even took a photograph on their phone.I am working-class. When the work stops, the money stops, and a new source of income must be found. I’m not embarrassed to be in my situation – I have two kids and two pensioners who live with me and I have a responsibility to provide for them. It’s not easy being out of work so suddenly but I don’t regret anything. I have been incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to be an MP, something I will always be grateful to the people of Crewe and Nantwich for.When I first ran for parliament, in 2017, I was very much the underdog. Described at the time in a somewhat misogynistic way as a “shrill local critic” of the sitting Conservative MP, I was actually just a strong and outspoken representative of my community. I was a working mother, a local school cuts campaigner and an ex-teacher with an axe to grind about the impact austerity was having on my community.I was fed up with politicians being so detached from reality. Some friends were being made redundant, while others were scraping by to pay for childcare to enable them to work. A colleague who was a teaching assistant confided in me that she was having to use the food bank. I was angry – and frankly still am. I had also come to the conclusion that politics isn’t some faraway thing that other people do, but a thing that affects everything about our lives – and so the only way to change the fortunes of my people was to get involved. That’s why I stood for election. Parliament needed more voices like mine.When I was elected, one of the things that made me so overjoyed was that now all these people had someone like them to fight for what they needed. I would be their voice in Westminster. My experience would also be proof that if I could do it, others like me could as well. I refused to let the snobbery in parliament bother me and I spoke up for what I believed in. Any feeling of impostor syndrome I might have had was pushed to the back of my mind.If we truly want our political system to work and people to be more engaged, then it is vital that we have more representatives who understand the daily existence of the average person. Even now I’m out of office I won’t stop fighting for my area and the people that I love. I would encourage anyone with a burning desire for change to now throw themselves into the fight. If my two years in parliament has taught me anything, it’s that we can’t let the privileged few determine our future.• Laura Smith is the former Labour MP for Crewe and Nantwich"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c30784702d5c9cd33b6d20344edb61e24bf8966/0_266_5240_3144/master/5240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f805d0ba5b7b8605e55cf52e59bd6868","title":"old young gap britain generation dysfunctional family","story":"When generations lead such separate lives, it damages everyone. We need deliberate initiatives to bring them togetherTravel around the periphery of any British town or city, and you will quickly behold a symbol of one of the most painful modern ides. The average residential care home will be set well back from the road, seemingly silent and apparently cut off from most of the life of the surrounding community. When people who know nothing of those inside glimpse such sights, what passes through their minds? Empathy, perhaps, with a family member living in such a facility mounting awareness, maybe, of the rising care crisis and our collective failure to solve it. But what such sights could also embody is the widening ide between generations, and people leading completely separate lives.What is often overlooked is the fact that generational isions are rooted in some of the deepest structures of society, not least our polarised housing economy. When I grew up in newly built 1970s suburbia, the ages of our adult neighbours ranged from new parents in their 20s to sixtysomething retirees. By contrast, new developments now often fall between stereotypical starter homes and separate houses and flats marketed at the over-50s. In some urban areas, council housing built for a wide range of people has long since been pushed into the private rental market and taken over by young professionals, while older, more rooted communities have dwindled. There and elsewhere, simple unaffordability has concentrated home ownership at the upper end of the age range, while the only option available to younger people is renting.According to research by the Economic and Social Research Council, between 2001 and 2011, the number of neighbourhoods in England and Wales with high levels of age segregation doubled to more than 2,000. About half the population in London, Birmingham, Manchester and other urban centres is now thought to be under 30, whereas old people dominate rural and coastal places. Between 1991 and 2014, the number of areas where the median age of the population was over 50 rose sevenfold. In the wake of the EU referendum, it has become fashionable to fixate on the political gap between towns and cities. What has been overlooked is the fact that this issue blurs into questions centred on age to the point that the two are impossible to disentangle.As well as simple geographical separation, what ides the attitudes and values of older and younger people is the historic economic shift from what remained of the comparative security and stability of the postwar settlement, to an economy characterised by quicksilver unpredictability and the sense of a shrinking world. Younger people tend to see the 21st century’s openness, ersity and connectivity as the natural order of things, but want deep inequalities and imbalances to be corrected. Many older people, meanwhile, are thrown by the sense of constant change, and want to try to hang on to whatever security they feel they have. I do not think these two perspectives are quite as irreconcilable as some people think, but they nonetheless sit right at the heart of a deep generation gap.This is hardly a favourable context for conversations about age, many of which are now coloured by a litany of insults, from “gammon” to “generation snowflake”, and lead to political dead-ends. Beyond close relatives, what do millions of us really know about the needs, values and lives of people at different stages of life from ourselves? Look at your Facebook friends. How many of them are significantly older – or younger – than you?Last week, an innovative social enterprise called United For All Ages released a report titled Together in the 2020s. As well as sketching out a picture of worsening age segregation and rising loneliness, it brings together an array of voices to make suggestions that pull off a rare trick: channelling idealistic impulses into ideas that seem eminently realistic. There is stuff about intergenerational housing, ensuring schools and colleges are paired with social projects focused on older people, and opening up universities to a much wider age range. Pointing the way ahead, a Liverpool-based initiative called Homeshare UK facilitates people living with older homeowners rent-free, in exchange for “companionship and roughly 10 hours per week of help with agreed tasks”. In some Dutch cities, students have been encouraged to live alongside pensioners, trading free accommodation for “teaching residents new skills – like how to email, use social media, Skype and even graffiti art”.United For All Ages’ co-founder, Stephen Burke, wants to ensure new housing developments include homes suited to people across the age range, and enthuses about intergenerational initiatives that are already well underway. In Clapham, south London, a Jewish faith-based nursery – which is open to all comers – called Apples and Honey now shares its premises with a care home, ensuring older people get to mix with children and families. The story began with parent-and-toddler groups being held once a week at the Nightingale House care home, before something more permanent was established, alongside a cafe and restaurant, and arts facilities.Here, it seems, is both a way of ensuring older people do not live in sealed-off silence, and a concrete example of how to bridge the generation gap, created in the spirit of self-help that now defines the kind of trailblazing change happening well beyond government. “Most of what we talk about is being done from the grassroots, by people pushing it on their own,” says Burke, although one of his big ideas is for a new Whitehall “Department of Connection”, “to join up and support intergenerational action nationally and locally”.Clearly, beyond organisations and initiatives, all of this stuff demands huge shifts in attitudes and behaviour. Given its origins in the most basic aspects of how we now live, a new politics predicated on age isn’t about to quickly recede. We need to start to collectively change as a matter of urgency. The generation gap is perhaps the key element in Britain’s passage towards life as a deeply dysfunctional national family, brimming with resentment and mutual incomprehension. Before things turn even more rancorous, therapy is required."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b4707b484e762928bdbe4b9a5efff84773f9508/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8df89dd9c1241fa3b85fd23ae6bb0f50","title":"the guardian view on electoral reform an argument labour needs to have","story":"Whichever candidates get through the current stage of the leadership race, proportional representation must be among the ideas they take with themA month after one of the heaviest defeats in its history, the Labour party is on its way to electing a new leader. Clive Lewis and Emily Thornberry have until Monday afternoon to win the support they need from MPs to join Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips in the contest’s second stage. This involves nominations from constituency parties, unions and affiliates, with members and supporters making the final selection and the winner due to be announced at a special conference in April.Questions about the future of Corbynism are at the forefront, with the socialist ticket of Ms Long-Bailey and Angela Rayner, who wants to be deputy, facing a strong soft-left challenge from Mr Starmer. How the party develops its policies following December’s drubbing is hugely important, and not just for Labour. Given the new government’s programme and Boris Johnson’s character, inidual credibility is a key factor: Labour knows it needs a leader who can hold the Conservatives to account. Geography and identity are crucial themes, with no easy answers to the problems thrown up by the growing ide between cities and towns, young and old, England and Scotland. Nor can the characteristics and backgrounds of the candidates be set aside. Unlike the other main UK parties, Labour has never elected a female leader.The political landscape of the next few years is fraught with risk – including the rise of a far-right party pushing a narrative of betrayal if Brexit turns out to be a disappointment. Under relentless pressure from the news cycle, it is not hard to see why many in Labour are anxious to see the party pull itself together quickly, and put on a brave face for the struggles ahead. But it is essential that the process of reflection about what went wrong under Corbyn is not short-circuited – and that ideas proposed by each of the candidates are explored.So far, Mr Lewis has done more than the other candidates to advance an analysis of Labour’s problems that goes beyond weaknesses of the manifesto, the leadership and Brexit to address the UK’s political system as a whole. On Sunday he launched a manifesto that included proposals for the democratisation of the BBC and a new body to represent women and girls, as well as plans for devolution, the abolition of the House of Lords and introduction of a proportional voting system (the latter is also supported by Ms Phillips, with the other candidates so far undecided).A erse field of candidates and ideas is important, which is why we hope that both Mr Lewis and Ms Thornberry will make it to the next round. In the past, hostility to electoral reform has come from the right and left of the party. Even now, it is unlikely to be the first priority of an opposition facing so many challenges. Nor is it the only policy area in which intellectual work, as well as the community organising that several leadership contenders have described as a priority, is needed. But the problems with first past the post, including the way it perpetuates a Labour-Tory duopoly, shuts out smaller parties and rewards nationalist ones (because votes piled up in one area are easier to convert into seats than those that are thinly spread) can no longer be ignored."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce75fca1d4f8b22d2a7288d72e30eaab4ef16d4e/0_1798_3358_2013/master/3358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f61632992f9b2e602d1313b3d01fbb","title":"south africas garden route discover the most scenic spots","story":"From barnacle-encrusted whales to sweeps of blooming fynbos, the south-eastern coast of South Africa offers the ultimate picturesque road tripSouth Africa’s Garden Route is almost obscenely good-looking. The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

Co-op, which is operated by Octopus Energy after it bought the business from the Midcounties Co-operative last year, will source the clean electricity for its new tariff directly from 90 local renewable energy generation projects across the UK, including the Westmill wind and solar farms in Oxfordshire. It plans to use all profits to reinvest in maintaining the community projects and building new ones.Customers on the Community Power tariff will be able to “see exactly where it is being generated at small scale sites across the UK, and they know it is benefiting local communities”, he said.Consumer group Which? has found that many suppliers offer renewable energy tariffs but do not generate renewable electricity themselves or have contracts to buy any renewable electricity directly from generators.Instead, the “pale green” suppliers exploit a loophole in the energy market by snapping up cheap renewable energy certificates, without necessarily buying energy from renewables projects. The certificates are issued by the regulator to renewable energy developers for each megawatt generated, but these can be sold separately from the electricity for a fraction of the price.Which? warned that these suppliers appear to be greenwashing their energy tariffs, which could risk misleading customers. A survey conducted last year found that one in 10 people believe that a renewables tariff means that the supplier generates at least some of its electricity from its own renewable energy projects.Ponsonby said the wind and solar schemes that generate electricity for the Community Power tariff “plough the profits they make back into their neighbourhoods or into helping other similar projects get off the ground”.Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus Energy, said being able to buy locally-sourced clean, green energy is “a massive jump in the right direction” which will help grow the UK’s green electricity capacity.“Investing in more local energy infrastructure and getting Britain’s homes run by the sun when it’s shining and the wind when it’s blowing can end our reliance on dirty fossil fuels sooner than we hoped,” he said.“Local people investing in local people means that we can all muck in and put the work in to decarbonise where governments and large companies are slow to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7ed0079d65ee272d090c142dc768f9f5bdcb0e4/0_0_5877_3526/master/5877.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73f6ca952a5eacdab2a28d96b9a5f25d","title":"gisele bundchen a model life the highest paid super talks about surviving anxiety","story":"For more than a decade, Gisele Bündchen was the world’s highest-paid supermodel. But it hasn’t always been so simple. She talks about anxiety and hitting rock bottom, ethical activism and surviving Twitter stormsIn the grand exhibition space of a Shanghai art museum, molecular blobs have been blown up on to giant screens to demonstrate the science element of a very long, very reverent summit on skincare hosted by Dior. The celebrity element is Gisele Bündchen, the face of a new range of creams and serums, who will shortly be on hand to help quantify how 30 years of advanced floral science and stem cell technology can help you look better. Being born looking like one of the most successful models of the century can also help, but no matter.“Health is becoming the new wealth,” announces Edouard Mauvais-Jarvis, Dior’s scientific communications director, to a room of 150 or so delegates. Gentle electronic music pulsates in a space with a Kubrick-meets-Instagram aesthetic: clinically all white, all bright, accented by pillars of pink peonies. Chic French PRs circle beauty journalists, editors and scientists, while kooky Asian influencers, like kooky influencers everywhere, take aloof but cute selfies.Bündchen – or Gisele, as she’s mononymously known – bounds on stage after being introduced via video montages of her career and the new Dior beauty campaign. There are lingering, soft-focus shots of her sitting with her eyes closed on a mountain or looking wistful on a beach, set to soaring strings. The emphasis is on the model’s credentials as an environmentalist, activist, mother and paragon of physical perfection. Dressed in flared blue jeans, white shirt tucked into a Christian Dior belt underneath a myrtle green blazer with black kitten heels, her trademark wavy blow-out bounces as she takes a seat.“I’m a big believer in your body being a temple,” she says. Her voice is a deliciously Brazilian-accented husk. She has been put in conversation on stage with Chinese actress Li Bingbing and a local TV presenter to talk about personal wellbeing and the planet. “What are we eating? What are our thoughts?” Gisele asks the audience. “Because when you feel better, you look better. And if we hurt nature, we’re hurting ourselves.”The presenter blinks and nods before inanely suggesting that “If the environment gets clean and prettier, we will become clean and prettier?” Li looks fantastically bored. It is left to Gisele to carry the weight of the event, which she does with amped up professionalism: enthusiastic, chatty, smiling throughout. She talks about her environmental activism, the need for inner beauty and peace to be the main goal, and why nature is a “one-word philosophy” that allowed her to heal her wounds. The presenter, seemingly awe-struck, closes her eyes and nods in agreement.Gisele, pronounced Gi-zell-ee by her family, was 13 when she won her first modelling competition in São Paulo. She and her five sisters, including her twin Patricia, grew up in a middle-class home in a small town in southern Brazil. She writes at length in her 2018 New York Times bestseller, Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life, about being bullied for looking too thin at school, of being a tomboy. The book is a hotchpotch of notes, a diary-slash-scrapbook of her life and how she apparently got there. She writes about being name-called “Olly” (as in Olive, Popeye’s skinny missus) and wearing “two pairs of pants to make my legs look thicker”.But by the time Gisele arrived in New York, at 18, and made her catwalk debut for Alexander McQueen, she’d been rebranded by him as “the Body” and “the boobs from Brazil” by Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana. The following year, in 1999, she became a sensation. Editors and designers declared the teenager, with her 36-24-35 bust-waist-hip ratio, marked the return of the curve she rang the death knell for the waifish angles of heroin chic. Throughout the noughties, she steadily became the highest-paid model in the world, and has now clocked more than 1,200 magazine covers.“All I cared about back then was to be like this,” she says, when we sit down together. “Like, I wanted to belong, I wanted people to like me and it was important to me so I would go out of my way to say yes to everybody. I wanted to please everybody. God forbid I would, like, disappoint anyone. And hey, that’s why I got panic attacks.”Gisele was at the height of her modelling career when she says, gravely, that she “hit rock bottom”. It was 2004. She was 24. She’d worked for every major designer, become the $25m face of Victoria’s Secret and landed her 76th cover of Vogue. She and Leonardo DiCaprio had been named one of the world’s most beautiful couples by People magazine, and their relationship was a tabloid fixture. Yet it was her lifestyle, she says, that sent her spinning.“I was eating steak and fries every night. I was drinking a bottle of wine and smoking cigarettes and having a mocha cappuccino for breakfast. That wasn’t so good.” For many this might qualify as an average Friday, but as a world-famous model Gisele developed severe anxiety. “It was uppers and downers, it wasn’t drugs, but I couldn’t sleep because I was drinking so much coffee during the day.”How does she feel seeing wellness and all she lived by transform pop culture? She shrieks. “I have five sisters, and if I find a new recipe or something I like, I share it with the group. This is why I’ve written the book. The whole point is more awareness, the more people get things like yoga, it’s a positive thing. The more people become awakened and conscious of the very decisions they’re going to make, then you don’t have a bunch of people, like, half asleep, you know?”All but one of her sisters, who is a federal judge, work (in various, not altogether clear ways) for the wellness brand worth hundreds of millions of dollars that Gisele has built around herself over the past two decades. Hers is a sun-kissed, barefoot hippy, organic aesthetic contrived as a lifestyle catalogue: all yoga poses at sunset and cosy sweaters and leggings, with inspirational mantras for simple, fuss-free, eco-living.Now, every morning, Gisele wakes up to the sound of the ocean waves from her phone speaker and begins a fastidious routine. Stretches and meditation come first, followed by swilling oil in her mouth for several minutes “to clean out all the guck and detoxify teeth and gums”. Then a workout listening “to a YouTube video on maybe ancient Egypt or Greece,” followed by drinking lemon and water, making healthy breakfasts and lunches for her kids, and sipping a green juice. The school run and a shower are completed before she begins her work in her garden office, the Sanctuary.Gisele swears she doesn’t find the regime difficult: most of her meals are plant-based snacks such as roasted pumpkin seeds are considered a treat. “I do it because it makes me feel better. It makes me happier in my life. I make those choices because it gives me something right back. And I’m happy that more people are getting access to that because the more people who know about it, the more it’s going to make them happier. And if you have a happier world, the better it’s going to be.”If Gisele’s lifestyle now is the warped embodiment of aspiration, it is one she has carefully curated. She split from DiCaprio in 2005, after it became clear he wasn’t on the same journey, so to speak. In 2009 she married the NFL star Tom Brady, after three years of dating. They have a 10-year-old son and an eight-year-old daughter together, along with Brady’s 12-year-old son from his previous relationship with actress Bridget Moynahan.Gisele and Brady’s is a cookie-cutter, loved-up wholesomeness. At their wedding, they gifted each guest a copy of pop-psychology guide The Mastery of Love. Forbes has named them one of the top three highest-earning celebrity couples of the past decade. When Brady’s friendship with Donald Trump caused a sensational backlash, it was Gisele who distanced the couple from the president. As Brady put it: “I talked to my wife and she said I can’t talk about politics any more. I think that’s a good decision for our family.”What does she credit to their success as a couple? “I’ve been with my husband for more than 12 years now and, as you know, men are very… They want a lot of attention. They’re like, they demand... They need a lot of attention, like children do, like your family, your friends. So I think the important part is to have fully present moments with everybody. I think that leads to fulfilment, because they don’t have half of you, they have all of you in that moment and then they get recharged.” Gisele seems to have cracked this one despite the clock running down and her neat ability to filibuster rather than answer all my questions, she holds perfect eye contact and maintains she is “fully here and I’m having this experience and having an exchange. I’m not picking up my phone or texting somebody or thinking about my laundry or my dogs. It’s the same thing with my kids. When I’m with them, I’m with them, on the floor with them, talking with them, really listening to them. Same with my husband.”After a decade of backing tree-planting reforestation initiatives in Brazil and launching a clean water project in her hometown, Gisele’s environmental activism is set to step up next year. Her Instagram feed, which she writes in Portuguese and English, is often scattered with missives that remind followers to take better care of the planet.Given her life at home and with work, is her carbon footprint a worry? Is she aware of what it is? “I’ve been working on something, but I can’t say it right now. It has to do with the movement of regenerating the planet,” she says. “I do everything I can do. We compost. We have a garden. Yes, I could probably live in a smaller house, but we have solar panels. I tell my children it’s about the three Rs: reduce, reuse, recycle. If you go into my closet, for example, you’re not going to believe it, because I have, like, the jeans I wore three years ago.” It feels churlish to point out that in the civilian world, this is totally normal: Gisele’s life exists on a plane of fabulousness because, well, surely, that is entirely the point of being Gisele.“That’s how I am,” she adds, still keen to maintain low-key relatability. “I don’t need stuff. When you need stuff it’s because you haven’t really worked out the inside.”Given that she turns 40 this year and is fronting a line of anti-ageing products, I ask how much she worries about her face and body changing as she gets older. “I think, for me, it’s more about the way I feel, you know what I mean? It’s like, I breastfed my kids for three years each because I felt it was the most important thing I could do and I wanted to give my children and myself that experience – you’re not going to have that again. Yes, it’s going to make your body change, yes I can work out to be fit and feel good and rejuvenated, but I can’t change the fact that both my kids liked the left boob.”In 2010, at 30, Gisele said that “there should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies for six months.” In 2015, seemingly going against her own well-pronounced principles on keeping all things in life natural, she was papped in Paris visiting a plastic surgeon for surgery on said left boob. Aware of the backlash that would ensue amid charges of hypocrisy, she bizarrely tried to disguise herself in a burqa but was caught out by paps who recognised her driver. She was ridiculed brutally online.“When I did that, I felt like I was trying to please. Because I was ‘the Body’ and…” She takes the briefest pause. “Look, I think if you do something because it is what you feel is your truth, then there is no problem. Then whatever you do is going to bring you joy. But if you do it because it’s somebody else’s idea of you, that’s the problem. So that was another lesson that I’ve learned the hard way. I feel like today, where I’m at with my life, I don’t really care what anyone thinks. I care about living my truth. I care about being a great mother.”She won’t elaborate on her feelings about getting older, suffice to say that again, “I mostly like to be outside with nature, doing something physical like surfing, horseback riding, I play volleyball, run around with my kids or take my dog for a walk. I don’t really exercise because I think I want my butt to look good or this way.” She smiles, fixed on wellness guru autopilot. “It’s important to do those things that really nourish you, benefit you, make you feel good,” she ends. “I think that’s vital.”Makeup by Yumi Lee using Dior Capture Totale Cell Energy hair by David von Cannon styling by Katie Mossman nails by Deborah Lippmann This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

On a set that was designed to replicate a futuristic town square (a white statue of a man on a horse stood in the centre of the box-like runway), models replicated Prada-ised commuters on their way to work.Three-piece suits were worn with trouser straps under the shoes, raincoats were accessorised with medical green gloves and riding boots and grey office trousers were matched with scoop-neck jumpers patterned with diamond-shaped optical illusions in red, black, yellow and grey.The best looks, however, were the ones which seemed to shift away from this idea of “everyday heroism” and go somewhere a bit more out-there: an aubergine-coloured ruffle shirt and tangerine winter jacket that looked straight out of Harold and Maude, worn with a pink polo neck and red trousers.Sartorial inspiration from traditional male archetypes has been plentiful this fashion week. On Saturday, Dolce and Gabbana featured a collection with nods to a number of workwear looks including the farmer, the painter and the builder, while Salvatore Ferragamo riffed on the looks of the sailor, the soldier, biker and businessman at their show on Sunday.These thematic looks at masculinity were interesting to note, at a time when Milan men’s fashion week is making something of a comeback, with fewer mixed male and female shows Gucci will host their first men-only show since 2016 later in the week.After the show, Miuccia Prada touched upon environmental issues, saying that she was hopeful about the state of fashion, despite environmental concerns. “It’s incredible that in one year sustainability became a normal thing, I’m very optimistic,” she said.Milan fashion week finishes on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/786a1c81c4b1608432dc8465d9697886c8ab25a8/0_0_4210_5613/master/4210.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79b26d3f37f34401acad59abbdb828ae 720w","title":"arsenal brighton wsl van de donk","story":"Two goals each from Beth England and Ji So-yun helped Chelsea come from behind against Bristol City and secure an emphatic 6-1 victory in the Women’s Super League on Sunday. City’s 18-year-old forward Ebony Salmon scored in her third consecutive game to give them an early lead but Chelsea broke back in the 28th minute and cruised to the win with Hannah Blundell and Jess Carter both on the scoresheet.After all the hype of a golden boot shootout between the new Chelsea striker Sam Kerr and Arsenal’s Vivianne Miedema, both remained off the scoresheet for the second successive game since the Australian Kerr arrived in London. Arsenal, though, were untroubled by the lack of a goal from their talismanic forward as her Dutch compatriots Daniëlle van de Donk and Jill Roord and the England duo Jordan Nobbs and Beth Mead ensured a 4-0 defeat of Brighton.Emma Mitchell struck a curling effort from outside the penalty area to give Tottenham the lead over West Ham on the defender’s full debut having joined on loan from Arsenal for the remainder of the season. Kenza Dali levelled the score late on but Rianna Dean’s stoppage‑time header snatched all three points for Spurs.Amalie Eikeland scored the only goal in a hard-fought win over Birmingham to lift Reading up to fourth. Manchester United’s visit to Liverpool was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch. The Manchester City forward Pauline Bremer paid tribute to the patience of the departing Nick Cushing after her fourth double of the season helped them to a 3-1 defeat of Everton. The German forward Bremer joined City from the European champions, Lyon, in 2017 as part of a deal that took England’s Lucy Bronze to the French side but a nasty leg break after scoring on her debut and subsequent related injury problems led to her making only six appearances in two years.Cushing kept the faith, though, and on Saturday Bremer rewarded the manager with her eighth and ninth league goals of the season. “I’m really thankful,” said the 23-year-old of Cushing. “He’s the one who brought me to this club and to England and I’m really grateful for the opportunity. With my injury history I’m glad that he didn’t let me drop at any point and always believed that I could make it after a long time out.”Bremer believes she is almost back to her best and that the injury has helped her development. “I feel like the injury was a big challenge but it definitely helped me in many ways,” she said. “When I was younger I maybe went into tackles a bit blind but now I’m a lot more clever about it. Mentally as well, you have to be strong to overcome an injury. I know what it is like not to have football, so I’m just very grateful to be back on the pitch and training pitch.”The manager, who leaves City for the MLS side New York City FC after his team play Arsenal on 2 February, told the players he was leaving on Thursday. “It was quite a surprise for all of us,” said Bremer. “We thought we would finish the season with him but sometimes in football things can happen really quickly.” Quelling fears that it could disrupt the flow of the team, the Germany international added: “I think we can manage it definitely. We have great staff behind the squad as well, the assistant coach will take over. We all know how to play football.”Cushing agreed and backed the assistant manager, Alan Mahon, to lead the team through to the end of the season and potentially beyond. “He’s got the ability to take it for sure,” he said. “It’s whether he sees being a head coach as his future, it’s whether he feels he is ready. He will be brilliant for the team because he has good relationships with all the players, he’s got a great football knowledge, he’s played the game at the highest level, but this football club will look for the right person.”“OK, I’ve pushed them hard at times and maybe they’ve pushed me hard and we’ve fallen out and argued. There’s a million things I’ve loved about this job but probably the proudest thing is earning the respect of the players and hearing them say nice things about me now is a testament to the hard work we’ve all put in together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f49ace0baf0c5f1285c073b2ba9e2452a84a3539/0_131_3290_1974/master/3290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64efae96e1e41d793df35dd6e4c46b1f","title":"pep guardiola honoured to witness sergio aguero make history","story":"• Agüero now most prolific overseas goalscorer in Premier League• City striker also set record for number of hat-tricks in top flightPep Guardiola said he was honoured to witness Sergio Agüero make history, as the Argentinian scored three goals to help Manchester City to a 6-1 victory and establish himself as the most prolific overseas goalscorer since the formation of the Premier League.

We all know that, although that doesn’t stop us from heaping it over our Weetabix every morning and adding it to tea and coffee.Too much sugar can lead to weight gain, causes tooth decay and increases the risk of diabetes. But it also has another profound effect – it messes with your sleep, and in such a way that your sleeplessness will leave you with a craving for more sugar.A 2016 study found that people who have diets high in sugar tend to sleep less deeply and display greater restlessness at night. According to Dr Michael Breus – AKA “the sleep doctor” – a US clinical psychologist who specialises in sleep disorders, too much sugar leads to a tendency to eat later in the day because blood sugar levels are zigzagging out of control. That adversely affects sleep, and your disrupted sleep will, in turn, produce an even greater craving for sugar the next day. The vicious circle is complete.Having too much sugar at night can be detrimental to our health. “When you eat sugar, your blood sugar levels rise and your pancreas releases insulin, which helps the sugar to be taken back into the cells, giving them fuel to run on,” says the dietitian Alex Evans. “Eating sugar late at night overstimulates you. It gives you energy and makes you ready for activity, but that is not what we’re trying to do at night. We’re designed to shut down towards the end of the day.”“Sugar uses up a lot of magnesium, which you need for sleep,” says the nutritional therapist Charlotte Watts, author of Good Mood Food and The De-Stress Effect. She points out that you should, in particular, avoid late-night chocolate, which contains caffeine and other stimulants.Dr Paul Kelley, a researcher into sleep patterns, accepts the link between high sugar intake and disturbed sleep, but cautions that more data is needed before we fully understand the causality. “Poor sleep and eating sugar and fatty foods do go together, but there is evidence on both sides about which direction it goes in,” he says. “Does eating sweet things make you sleep less or does sleeping less make you eat sweet things?”He says the average adult needs at least seven hours sleep a night any less and you will be looking for short-term energy boosts, and the combination of bad diet and poor sleep will damage your health.“We have a major problem with sleep and a major problem with food, and they interact,” says Kelley. “Sugary foods are likely to disrupt your sleep. The rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t eat in the two hours before you go to sleep.” He recommends avoiding caffeine and switching off the TV an hour before bed.“There’s a real biochemical drive to eat more sugar,” says Watts. “The body recognises that resources are low, and you need something that acts as a crutch.” She says bingeing on sugary foods can be a sign of loneliness. “When we don’t have enough joy in life, we tend to turn to things that can prop us up instead, and sugar is one of those. Sugar is a massive self-medicator.”The encouraging news is that the craving can be broken. “Blood sugar is like a rollercoaster, but fibrous foods such as wholemeal and granary bread, and potatoes in their skins can help to control it,” says the dietitian Anna Hardman. “They release sugar over a much longer period and reduce the spikes.” Your overworked pancreas gets a well-earned rest.Foods high in tryptophan are recommended for enhancing sleep. These include beans, lentils, nuts, whole grains and poultry. Or you could opt for a meal with sleep-inducing carbs and some protein. “Tryptophan helps to make the neurotransmitter serotonin, known as the ‘happy hormone’,” says Evans. “One of the things it does is prepare you for sleep.”So what should those who have late-night food cravings eat? “Good sources of tryptophan are cottage cheese and turkey,” she says. “Certain plants are seen to have a sleepy effect – lettuce, for example. A turkey and lettuce sandwich on wholegrain bread would give you slow-release carbohydrates from the bread, tryptophan from the turkey, producing your serotonin, and the soporific effect from the lettuce.”Watts recommends eating well throughout the day, starting with plenty of protein for breakfast, to counteract fluctuating blood-sugar levels. “The less you rely on sugar and caffeine to prop you up through the day, the more you are able to go into healthy sleep patterns at night,” she says.Healthy eating, exercise and an evening wind-down produce good sleep, and the vicious circle turns virtuous. Sleep well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/238514e13d76397a7ee8d71ae813f0893f10b43b/0_0_2119_2121/master/2119.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5b0bb0c570af07128a461fe36c6e949 720w","title":"facebook us election 2020 news lies campaigns fact check","story":"Two big announcements were made in the US political media this week, and the outcome of one will likely have a profound effect on the 2020 election. The New York Times announced the process and date for revealing which candidate it will endorse on the very crowded Democratic ticket, and Facebook reiterated its policies (or maybe lack of them) on political advertising.Many things have happened since the 2016 election to both the press and technology companies, in terms of examining their respective roles in democracy. And while there have been plenty of laments that too little has changed in the intervening four years, the truth is that one thing – control of the media – has changed significantly.If you want to find out what one of the house journals of the Democratic establishment thinks of the party’s candidates, mark your calendars for 19 January. The New York Times has been putting a thumb on the electoral scale since 1860, but this time its opinion desk is moving if not towards radical transparency, then at least towards a little reader-driven openness, by publishing transcripts of candidate interviews and offering some insight into its deliberations.The antediluvian practice of a news organisation declaring for a candidate and party is a necessary ritual, not least for the news organisations themselves, and it has the benefit of stoking public conversation around the democratic process. Insofar as influence goes, though, it is more akin to a vicar saying daily prayers in an empty church. News organisation endorsements are not what win elections. What do win them are narrowly targeted ad campaigns, according to people who sell narrowly targeted ad campaigns.If one is to believe the internal communication to Facebook colleagues from executive Andrew Bosworth, which surfaced last week, the 2016 election was won not by the interference of Russian troll factories, or by the psychometric salesmen at Cambridge Analytica, but because Trump, in Bosworth’s words “ran the single best digital ad campaign I’ve ever seen from any advertiser”.Given the Trump campaign spent heavily on Facebook and benefited from teams of Facebook employees embedded within the campaign, Bosworth might have substituted “he” for “we”. The rambling memo, which included a mishmash of insights from Lord of the Rings and the philosopher John Rawls, was a rather effective way of informally signalling how Facebook management was thinking about its role in elections ahead of 2020.Bosworth started his missive by explaining why Facebook would not use its own tools and practices to decide the outcome of the next election, even if that meant the election of a lying candidate. Facebook will, it seems, only put its thumb on the scale for a candidate or campaign when paid to do so, as a vehicle for targeted advertising.Bosworth’s memo provided an early smokescreen for an announcement later in the week that Facebook was holding fast to its policy of not fact-checking or removing untruthful statements in political advertising. For those concerned about the fairness of elections, this was a disappointing response. Even a very low bar for claims would be better than no bar and, much more importantly, an agreement to stop using the targeting methods which segment voters on an inidual level would limit the vast opportunities to run dishonest campaigns.It has always made commercial sense for Facebook to refuse to be the regulator for political advertising, for two key reasons. First, it doesn’t actually have the human capacity or skill to reliably check and remove untruthful campaign material.And second, because some of its biggest and most powerful clients – political parties and governments – don’t want it to. On a broader principle, media companies should be setting their own standards for what is acceptable and ethical – but they should not be setting the rules for the rest of society.In 2016, the Trump campaign ran 5.9m different advertisements in six months, compared with Hillary Clinton’s negligible 66,000, each one a subtle variant which can be created, tested and targeted. It is a system that cannot be effectively policed without either a change of business model or more stringent external regulation. The persuasion of societies happens through multivariate testing of different messages, whether buying bed sheets or elections.We know a great deal more about the dynamics of how information and misinformation is deployed during elections than we did in 2016. Media gatekeepers, which are now principally companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter and Apple, are still struggling to develop both methods and organisational cultures that meet the role.Those that have been losing control of gatekeeping over two decades, the news organisations, have bigger problems. In the past four years the media in the US and UK have learned what other parts of the world woke up to some time ago: namely, that politicians can be elected without ever engaging with the news media.Presidents and prime ministers can succeed by telling lies and avoiding any accountability in terms of public scrutiny. This is a global phenomenon – Narendra Modi, India’s charismatic authoritarian leader, has never held a press conference. The White House press secretary has not held a briefing for half a year – not even in the last week, when the US has teetered on the brink of a war.Politicians across the spectrum understand that there is little to be gained by subjecting themselves even to good faith questioning. When the Conservative government is reportedly considering no longer participating in a serious programme such as Newsnight because its new policy editor, Lewis Goodall, was active in student politics a long time ago, it is hoping to read the last rites over any type of difficult public questioning. Who would seek out this kind of scrutiny when they could just stick to their own accounts on social media?What comes with it – the trolling, disinformation, virtual and real threats – only serve to remove the more fair-minded. Set against this trajectory, Facebook’s policy of applying less scrutiny to political advertising than other types looks more reckless than reasonable.Even with the impossibility of policing, the reduction in revenue and likely evasion of any rules, it would be good to know that the new gatekeepers understand the importance of demonstrating their own values. If running the best dishonest digital campaign is the way to win, those responsible for enabling it are as much at fault as those who commission it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11209bc636cb070af3e07c0ca9eee593d757ed40/1085_620_2875_1725/master/2875.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d269fe0cee4137e5ea8fdf1d254aee6c","title":"nepal metal silence festival kathmandu","story":"Nepal’s police used to pick up metal fans and cut their hair or jail them. The country now has its own festival – but it’s fighting to survive. Our writer hits the rarefied air of KathmanduWhen Ugra Karma made the first-ever Nepali metal recording, they didn’t intend to start a subculture. They just wanted to make life easier for themselves. “When we started to do shows,” says guitarist Prateek Raj Neupane, “our playing skills were at an amateur level. And the instruments we had were amateurish. And the sound didn’t come out good. We couldn’t explain what we wanted to sound engineers at shows, so we thought maybe we should do a record and give it to them so they could fix our sound. And that’s how we ended up recording the first-ever metal record in Nepal.”That was in 2000 and the recording – the magnificently titled demo Himalayan Metal of Death, featuring a song called Perversion or Cutting Up of a Human Body \u0026amp Eating Some of It – wasn’t made for general release. “We were thinking about bringing out three copies only, for the three people who recorded it. We would lend one to sound engineers at gigs. But our friends were adamant on us at least making 100 copies. We brought one of our friends’ father’s office printers to my home, made our own design and printed it.” The Nepali metal underground was born.Back then, it was so underground that Ugra Karma, who were without a drummer, couldn’t even explain what death metal was to whoever filled in on the drum stool. “We would ask, ‘Do you play double bass drums?’” That’s the high-speed pummelling that powers death metal along. “They would tell us something like that didn’t even exist. So we switched instruments between songs. In one, I would do guitar and vocals, my friend would do bass, the other would do drums. But because we are not real drummers, we would get tired, so then I would go to drums and the other one would go to guitars. And then switch again.”In truth, all metal in Nepal is still underground. This is one of the world’s poorest countries – ranked in the bottom quarter in the world for GDP per capita – and subject to political instability. The country was still recovering from a 10-year civil war that ended in 2006 when it was devastated by an earthquake in 2015. Corruption is endemic and the combination of denim, leather and long hair is still viewed with suspicion. Its music industry hasn’t the slightest interest in metal, which means everything has to be DIY.For years, the police would pick up metal fans and cut off their long hair. Everyone mentions this as if it were a perfectly everyday thing. While that has stopped, the metal community still doesn’t have it easy: being a metalhead requires a level of commitment unknown in the west. “Recently, I was in jail for 15 days for putting on a thrash fest,” says Vishal Rai, who founded the Extreme Underground Metal Society of Nepal, which organises shows in the country. “Cops arrived in a van and said, ‘What kind of a noise is this?’ They took me in and charged me under noise pollution. I was kept inside for 15 days. This was a few months back. I am still on parole.”This is the world in which the eighth edition of Silence festival exists. Nepal’s biggest metal event, established by Bikrant Shestra of the band Underside, is tiny by western standards: it takes place in two courtyards of a small hotel and restaurant complex in Kathmandu. But for Nepali metal, to have 1,500 or so fans in one place to watch a succession of bands across two stages one Saturday in mid-December is huge.There are local groups – the excellent stoner rock trio Shree 3 Born in Silence, who owe such a debt (visually and sonically) to one particular band that they might as well be called KnotSlip grindcore band Chepang, who have three singers, two drummers and no bassist Prateek’s other death metal band, Binaash and Underside themselves. There are bands from around Asia. And there is a big-name headliner: Californian thrash veterans Testament.The day before Silence, though, there’s a sense of nervousness. It has been raining hard in Kathmandu, which means the site isn’t ready. Driving round the city, the surrounding mountains hidden from view by the lowering clouds and the traffic jostling on rutted and puddled roads, it’s hard to imagine how anyone could make a festival work here. And, as Underside’s singer Avishek KC explains, Nepal has a pay-on-the-day culture, and if the rain stays, the fans won’t come. What’s more, Testament’s fee alone accounts for more than the ticket revenue a sold-out event will bring, a situation made more worrying by the fact that one of the biggest sponsors has halved its funding. Worse still, Underside – the most popular metal band in Nepal – can’t even play their own festival: their drummer lives in Assam, in India, and can’t leave his girlfriend’s home because of the civil unrest there. There is gunfire outside the house and flights have been suspended.Silence is clearly not going to make its organisers rich. Festival director Flower KC, who also manages Underside, reckons this one will lose £25,000, all covered by him and his friends. “The idea is guided by the idea that why should it be only mountaineers or hippies who come to Nepal?” Flower says. “Why can’t we attract a different breed of people? My goal is to make Nepal a heavy metal destination. Testament came to play purely because it was in Kathmandu – I hung out with them and they were stoked to be here.“Fast forward 10 to 15 years, my dream is that our festival makes music fans want to travel to Nepal to see the sickest bands.” But he needs international sponsorship. “We don’t have infinite money, and sponsorship games are pretty weird in this country.”While the people who run the festival might be middle-class by Nepali standards, they are not in western terms – all the Nepali metal musicians have other jobs. Prateek plays guitar in two bands, teaches leadership to management students in college, and acts in Nepali movies Flower, who lives in the UK, works in local government in London.Money matters here. “If you want to see real Nepal, you have to step out of the city,” Avishek says. “And people in the villages – until two years ago, you had all these power cut-offs, 18 hours a day without power. So people didn’t even have a choice to listen to music.” Prateek adds: “Working class here means something very different from England. They are so busy trying to get food and shelter for today that they do not have the luxury to come to gigs and listen to music and, in their terms, waste time.”Being middle class, and having other avenues open to them, few metal bands last long – and fans don’t tend to stick with the scene far into their 20s. “They will regularly follow metal up to college,” says Vishal Rai. “But after college, they will get pressure from society and family to find a job. After college, they mostly follow a different lifestyle. But there are a few people who always stick to metal, like me. I’m very old to be into this stuff – I am 35.”Having such a young scene is healthy in some ways, Prateek says. There are always young bands and fresh fans coming along. But because the scene is so young, no one has their own money, which means ticket prices have stayed low for 20 years, making it impossible for bands to even cover their costs.Despite overnight storms, Saturday dawns clear. In the early morning, women are at the city’s wells, taking advantage of the good weather to get their washing done. Worshippers are making their clockwise walks around the roadside shrines that dot the city. And at the festival site, volunteers, having been unable to work the previous day, frantically pull everything together. Silence kicks off just a few minutes late and the crowd swells as the afternoon wears on. The majority of fans are local, with a few Europeans and Americans. One Peace Corps worker, who has come in from out of town, is sporting a T-shirt from the recent Extreme Gore Fest III event. When he went in the pit there, he says, everyone fled because he was twice their height and they thought he’d crush them.The whole thing is fabulous: supremely good-natured and cooperative. There are local oddities: instead of the battle jackets – sleeveless denim covered with patches beloved of western metalheads – a fair few of the fans have sewn a big patch on to the back of a piece of entirely unmetal clothing. I see a Napalm Death patch on the back of a plaid shirt, though I’m not sure the lad who has attached a Pantera patch to the back of his waterproof has done its weather-resistant qualities any good. Best of all, Underside get their moment of glory after all. On learning of their drummer-less state, Testament’s Gene Hoglan – a legend in thrash metal – volunteers to spend the afternoon learning four songs so they can play a short set. Avishek is almost shaking with excitement when he tells me. “Gene Hoglan is going to play with Underside! Gene fucking Hoglan!”After night falls, Testament take to the stage, the biggest metal band ever to have come to Nepal. Their singer, Chuck Billy, surveys the crowd. He’s played to thousands of audiences, most bigger than this, but I’ve rarely seen a man look so delighted to be fronting a band. “How are you fucking doing?” he shouts, then pauses to laugh. “Kathmandu?” And he shakes his head in disbelief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/827c743813911b44536d24042b1094f35fffb9db/153_0_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c551d5731540faea4c612196d7ffc0a","title":"vijay iyer ritual ensemble review harvard wigmore hall london ganayva","story":"Wigmore Hall, LondonPianist Iyer’s postgrad arts course brought Ritual Ensemble together – and this was an uplifting evening, with a star performance from vocalist GanavyaVijay Iyer introduced the Ritual Ensemble’s concert in his Wigmore Hall composer-in-residence series by observing: “We all have an affiliation with Harvard University. But don’t hold that against us” – an acknowledgement of jazz listeners’ admiration for the unpremeditated here-and-now. The Indian-American jazzclassical artist and academic is a masterly juggler of polymathic erudition, improv’s strange detours and communally infectious grooving. But if this performance was skewed more toward hooky buildups and incantatory singing than back-doubles jazz deviations, the music was often sonically rich and sometimes thrilling, particularly from multi-talented young vocalist Ganavya.Formed on the postgrad Harvard arts course Iyer runs, the Ritual Ensemble features Ganavya, virtuosic percussionist and mridangam-drummer Rajna Swaminathan, and richly experienced Cuba-born saxophonistcomposer Yosvany Terry. Swaminathan’s opener of churning low tones and snapping accents led via a pianosax dialogue to a gently melancholy theme, drawing in Ganavya’s rapturously keening sound – and a pattern of rising climaxes and quiet descents emerged, with Iyer’s precise but jazzily asymmetrical piano solos often spurring Terry into soulfully beboppish variations.Quiet, spacey episodes often brought the best from a band that occasionally lost their clarity when the intensifying wail of vocals and polyphony of upper-end sax and piano blurred too closely together, but a haunting Ganavya a capella passage – softly duetting with her own harmonising vocal loops – and the finale’s cascade of bell-like piano chimes, tonally startling drumming and vocal exhortations falling to whispers were enthralling highlights. The repetitions of ritual dominate the curveballs of improvisation in this band, but Iyer’s sweeping take across the range of contemporary musicality is always uplifting to witness.• Vijay Iyer’s third Wigmore Hall composer-in-residence concert, with London’s Aurora chamber orchestra, is on 10 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45554736df25f57f4a4f1f37fc22f3a644a6d778/0_41_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=650789bb9fb47bd5b1afd0b9bc48233f","title":"standing room only and a hungry stork sundays best photos","story":"’s picture editors select photo highlights from around the world, including a protest race in Bangkok and a volcanic eruption in the Philippines"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5e6c2d4f65f077c097baf33354baf57a42e4041/135_55_828_497/master/828.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdf936b0ecf3c44157586890756d1099","title":"black mps tell of being confused with other politicians","story":"Abena Oppong-Asare says she has been taken for a junior member of staff at WestminsterTwo black female MPs have told of how they have been mistaken for other politicians and for parliamentary staff members in their first few weeks working in Westminster.Abena Oppong-Asare, the new MP for the London seat Erith \u0026amp Thamesmead, has claimed that a Conservative MP who saw her outside the Commons chamber put his bag in her hands and asked her to look after it, not realising she too was an MP.In a string of tweets about her experiences since being elected, the former councillor said one MP had confused her with another black MP, and on realising his mistake said expressed surprise that there were “more of you”. Oppong-Asare, who is chair of the Labour Women’s Network, also described how an MP from another party came to talk to her about a conversation they had apparently had together before Christmas.She tweeted: “I realised a few mins in she got me confused with another #BlackSista.“I’m thinking I might need to write my name on my forehead as I think some people are really struggling to tell the difference.”On the incident outside the Commons’ chamber she wrote: “One of the Tory MPs walked straight to me to put his bag in my hands asking me to look after it. #ThisIsWhyRepresentationMatters.”Her colleague Florence Eshalomi, the newly elected MP for Vauxhall, replacing Kate Hoey, wrote to her online: “Girl I also got confused for another black sista MP as we were coming out of the voting lobby…… but I have to admit it was by a fellow Labour MP.“Guess we all need to wear massive name tags right.”This is not the first time black female MPs have complained about mistaken identity.Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities minister, who is running to be deputy leader of the party, said she was once mistaken for being a cleaner.Butler, who is the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, said she was in a members-only lift when an MP, who she has never named, told her: “This lift really isn’t for cleaners.”The Labour MP for Brent Central said it had been one of “so many incidents” of racism she had encountered while in parliament.She also said that in 2005, a minister had also once challenged her about being on the Commons terrace, which is reserved for MPs. She said he remarked: “They’re letting anybody in nowadays.”MPs rallied to support and sympathise with Oppong-Asare and Eshalomi online. However, the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, was criticised for saying she had a “similar experience”.Rayner, who is running to be deputy leader of the party, wrote: “Me and Jess Phillips often have the same problem because we both have an accent despite them being totally different.”She later deleted the message, saying her remark on mistaken identity had been poorly judged, adding: “As I would in no way compare that to my colleagues who are mistaken due to the colour of their skin.”One Labour supporter online wrote: “For future reference when Black women are talking about their lived experiences, simply listen and fight the urge to interject.”A Labour member wrote that Rayner’s remark meant he would no longer vote for her in the deputy leadership election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f5dafd4e88479e87f4a102132d7b3928f350d82/0_314_4716_2830/master/4716.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75058d41addfdeb7e2fe95f429b9cd82","title":"labour leadership hopefuls make final pitches for support","story":"Several contenders still short of 22 backers needed to go to next round as deadline nearsLabour MPs hoping to take over the party leadership will make their final behind-the-scenes pitches to colleagues for their support ahead of nominations closing on Monday.Last-minute phone calls, messages and meetings will be held as contenders to replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader, and Tom Watson as deputy, rally MPs and MEPs to try to reach the threshold of 22 nominations to get through to the next round.Those who hit the threshold last week, including the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, Jess Phillips, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey, will still be trying to boost their support base as their leadership bids continue.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, who has struggled to gain support after being the first person to declare she was running for leader, told the BBC she was confident she would reach the threshold by the time nominations close on Monday at 2.30pm.Clive Lewis, the shadow treasury minister, was on just four nominations – including the nomination he gave himself – with just 24 hours before the cut-off.Angela Rayner’s runaway success in support from colleagues for the deputy position has put her on 72 nominations. Labour’s sole MP in Scotland, Ian Murray, is also through to the next round by getting the backing of 30 MPs and MEPs.MPs will be keen to see whether the most leftwing candidate Richard Burgon can get through to the next stage for deputy leader. He was on 18 nominations and said if he reached 22 he would ask people to back another candidate so that members have the widest possible choice on the eventual ballot paper.Rosena Allin-Khan, who had the support of 17 people, and Dawn Butler, who had 15, will be among those hoping that a last-minute surge in declarations will go in their favour.Nandy, the MP for Wigan whose pitch for leader is strongly about reconnecting the party with its heartland voters, will make her first speech in the campaign on Monday in Dagenham, east London.In her pitch for the leadership Long-Bailey has said she wants to abolish the House of Lords and would not stand in the way of another Scottish independence referendum.The shadow business secretary, who is a close ally of Corbyn, said having “completely unelected people” within the structure of government was wrong and representative of the “Westminster bubble”.She remains behind Starmer in early polling of members over Corbyn’s replacement.She told the Sky News programme Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “I do want to abolish the House of Lords and we’ll be rolling out as my campaign progresses how we intend to really shake up that constitutional package.“MPs like myself, we’re fed up of the Westminster bubble, and fed up of our communities feeling like decisions about their lives are made in Westminster consistently. We’ve got to shift power and wealth into our communities.”On how the work of MPs would be scrutinised with no upper chamber, she said: “There would need to be checks and balances in place but to have a set of completely unelected people doing that I don’t think is right. We need to have people who are able, experts and democratically accountable to the community that they represent, not people appointed by parties.”Long-Bailey, who has positioned herself as the most leftwing of the leadership candidates, also said she could support a second referendum on Scottish independence if she was ever elected prime minister, despite wanting to retain the union.She said: “I wouldn’t want to inhibit the democracy of people because that’s one of the most fundamental pillars that we’re proud of in this country, but I don’t support in any way the breaking up of Scotland from the UK.“I’m fully committed to the union and I don’t think that should be shaken in any way, but ultimately the people of Scotland need to make the case and they’ve got their own parliament to determine whether they want to push that and that will be for me as a prime minister to review and to look at.”References to her being the “continuity Corbyn candidate” in the race were “annoying” she said, but she agreed she was a socialist.“It annoys me when people say that and unfortunately, as a woman, it annoys me even more. I’m a person in my own right,” she said.On running an effective joint ticket with Angela Rayner, who is standing to be deputy leader of the party, she said: “We always joked, to be honest, that the pair of us, that if it ever goes wrong, ‘you know it’s going to be me and you that’s going to have to sort it out’… and then when we had the defeat and it was devastating.“We both sat down and was like, you know we were joking, you know we actually are going to think about this.”Thornberry, who was once one of the most prominent people in Corbyn’s team and deputised for him at prime minister’s questions, has so far struggled to get support for her bid. She told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: “From the conversations I’ve had this weekend I’m fairly confident that so long as I don’t get any slippage, I’ll be fine. I’ll get across the line and then we move on to the next stage.“I’ve been a slow starter but I did start from a standing start after the general election.”The former barrister, who backed remaining in the EU and a second referendum, said she could withstand the ups and downs of the leadership contest as she comes from a long line of “tough old birds”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f1164b41feaf7a3cb9812afe047a091daf7a40e/0_189_5392_3235/master/5392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f529325282bb7c34aaad534ab43aef30","title":"pm to visit northern ireland as assembly reopens for business","story":"Boris Johnson expected to meet first and deputy first ministers in show of supportThe prime minister is expected to meet the first and deputy first ministers of Northern Ireland in Belfast on Monday to demonstrate support for the new power-sharing government in the region, at the same time as a five-party cross-community coalition restarts the process of running the province’s health, education, transport and other devolved ministries.The Northern Ireland assembly will reopen for business after an unprecedented Saturday sitting of the regional parliament that took place three years after the collapse of the power-sharing devolved government.Sinn Féin withdrew from the Stormont executive over the role of their main coalition partners, the Democratic Unionist party, in a controversial, botched green energy scheme that wasted hundreds of millions of pounds.Boris Johnson said on Sunday that local politicians had “shown great leadership” in agreeing to what he described as a “fair and balanced deal in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland”.His Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar said that political leaders in the region deserved praise “for their decision to put the people they represent first and make measured compromises to reach a deal”.One of the first issues that the new devolved government will have to tackle is the crisis in the NHS. Northern Ireland has the longest waiting lists in the UK and is facing further strike action from NHS workers including nurses over a disparity in pay between them and their colleagues on the other side of the Irish Sea.The newly appointed health minister and former Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann pledged on Sunday to resolve the ongoing industrial action and will meet unions this week.Central government has promised to inject hundreds of millions of pounds into the Northern Ireland NHS in the aftermath of the political agreement that led to the restoration of the devolved government.Commenting on the need to end the health strike, Swann said: “Obviously, the financial package for the new executive and support from other ministerial colleagues will be central to making that happen. We need our nurses and other health workers back at work. There’s a massive challenge for all of us in making our health service better and our great staff have a vital role to play in that.”The UUP health minister also vowed that he would not allow the two dominant parties in the ruling coalition – Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionists – to “play party politics with health”.All of the ministries in the devolved government were allocated to parties in proportion to their seats in the assembly except Justice. That ministry is elected on a cross-community vote as part of an agreement dating back ten years. The centrist Alliance party and its leader, Naomi Long, will now head up the department in charge of policing and the courts because unionists have insisted that Sinn Féin cannot control the Justice ministry given that party’s past association with the IRA.At the core of the deal that resurrected the devolved power-sharing government was a plan by the British and Irish government to create two new “language commissioners” as part of a cultural policy to put Irish on the same legal par with English while protecting Ulster British culture.Over the last three years Sinn Féin’s key demand to re-enter coalition with the Democratic Unionists has been for a stand-alone Irish language act that would put Gaelic on an equal par to English.Unionists have opposed such a move but, in a bid to address their concerns, the two governments drew up plans for “an Ulster British language commissioner dealing with Ulster Scots language and associated culture and heritage” as well as an Irish language commissioner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d675423d5d1f73c0bac3bb0e13517dc623afae2/516_307_1464_878/master/1464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe70798d9a7fa4bd62c676d9c1c98f56","title":"happy fleet could electric vehicles enhance the joy of driving","story":"EVs mean cleaner cities, but could they improve the experience for drivers too? One ground-breaking partnership piloted by Audi and Addison Lee Group uncovered some surprising benefits to going electricFor companies that rely on fleet vehicles, change is inevitable. A raft of green policies have introduced zero-emissions targets, along with financial incentives encouraging businesses to adopt cleaner cars and vans, such as no vehicle tax for electric company cars in 202021.However, as well as helping the planet and improving a company’s bottom line, the “greening” of vehicle fleets by going fully electric could bring additional benefits. A recent widely reported study found that jumping behind the wheel of an electric car – rather than a traditional petrol or diesel – could also make drivers happier, calmer and less stressed too.Those findings are backed up by Audi’s own research, which found that electric vehicle drivers typically get more pleasure from the experience. According to a combination of 1,350 surveys and 2,000 minutes of interviews, the benefits include a reduction in vibration and engine noise, which can leave drivers feeling less drained after spending time in traffic. EV drivers also reported being able to perform difficult manoeuvres much more easily, and a greater sense of control. Others felt more at one with the vehicle as a result of all the technology. As one respondent put it: “It’s part of me when I drive. It has so much tech involved in it.”That Audi research is now being put to the test as part of a forward-thinking pilot partnership with the Addison Lee Group’s business class car service, Tristar.Addison Lee Group has added five new luxury e-tron SUVs, Audi’s first fully electric cars, with a range of up to 237 miles, to its premium London lineup. The aim is to offer chauffeurs, customers, and both businesses a unique opportunity to understand the real-world performance, opportunities and challenges of going fully electric to achieve a zero-emissions future.The Addison Lee Group chauffeurs underwent simple training with Audi’s electric vehicle specialists before going out to work as usual, driving premium customers around the capital.The ongoing trial enables Addison Lee Group and Audi to see how the cars perform in a real-world, business-critical situation – where running out of battery is not an option. That includes collecting hard data on mileage and usage from the car’s telemetrics, along with the driver’s subjective feedback on the challenges of adopting electric in real-world conditions, including things such as the availability of charging.The proof, though, is in the driving. So what did Addison Lee Group’s trialists make of the experience behind the wheel?“From the beginning I said that I was going to drive it the same way I would a diesel car and that’s what I’ve done,” says Alan Meere, a platinum chauffeur for Tristar. “I feel more relaxed when I get home because I haven’t spent the day fighting the steering wheel. There’s also no droning constantly in your ear like you can get with diesel cars, and you notice that especially after a motorway run. You still get the noise of the tyres but even that’s quieter.”According to Meere, who lives in Sittingbourne, Kent and has been driving for the Addison Lee Group for nine years, any potential anxiety about range soon subsided.“When I came into the pilot, my main reservations were things like whether there would be enough chargers,” he says. “Also, would living so far from London make a difference? But once you realise how good the car is, and you start to understand how to fit charging into your daily routine, that all goes away. Many service stations now have these chargers.”“Being able to plug it in and leave it overnight is hugely convenient,” says Meere. “But if I’m not home long enough for work reasons, then there are also options close by where I can charge it quickly, ready for the next day.”According to figures from Zap Map, a listing app that helps you find your nearest charge points, there are more than 10,000 charging locations in the UK. Finding nearby charge isn’t dissimilar to seeking out your closest petrol station – you learn the locations of the points you use most often.“I’ve developed a map in my head of where I can charge,” says Meere. “If I need a speedy charge, there are three places I use regularly – one at Heathrow and two near where I live. On the 150Kw points I can get close to full in 40 minutes,” he adds.This partnership has been so successful that it’s been extended beyond the initial six months. “I believe our collaboration with Addison Lee Group has been invaluable as a means of further demystifying the concept of the fully electric Audi,” says Andrew Doyle, director of Audi UK.“Although the e-tron is revolutionary as far as our brand is concerned, this project has helped to emphasise its uncomplicated, user-friendly normality to everyone who travels in one. On the one hand, it has proved that it requires minimal compromise as a daily-use proposition by meeting the understandably rigorous demands of Addison Lee Group’s professional drivers in an undeniably challenging working environment. On the other, it has driven home the fact that in terms of comfort, configuration and general usability, the car is a home-from-home for anyone familiar with a contemporary Audi.”Paul McCabe, corporate director at Addison Lee Group, says the pilot has helped to inform the group’s decisions about the fleet choices it will make as it works towards its target of having a fleet capable of zero emissions by 2022. “By generating data-driven insights, the e-tron pilot has allowed us to evaluate the real-world performance and requirements of electric vehicles in our fleet of the future,” he says.Although big change is coming, much will stay the same, and that’s a comfort for those who will experience the revolution first hand.“It’s still a car and you still just drive it the same way,” says Meere, “but it’s just more pleasant to drive. If I had the choice, I’d stay with the electric vehicle now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a3283f2241793bd3428054a9d05ddb646058324/219_573_567_340/master/567.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16eabf46b470411c30973e4c2cc6fc81","title":"sweat and the city londons best running routes","story":"Jog through the history, skyscrapers and wilder corners of the capital for the perfect combination of urban adventure and natural beautyThe beauty of leading a running community like Fly Girl Collective is the chance to turn London into our playground – whether we’re sprinting around picturesque gardens south of the river, or ambling happily past a buzzy cafe in the east before returning later for brunch. We always discover somewhere new, because if there’s anything Londoners can bank on in this mighty city, it’s plenty of wonderful places and trails to run – all offering an assortment of terrain, from knobbly hills to the smoothest footpaths.Ready? Get set, go ...Richmond ParkThe chance to watch deer roaming free is the usual draw of Richmond Park – a certified national nature reserve. Covering almost 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres), it is the largest royal park in London and feels like you’re stepping into a whole new world, especially if you hit the Tamsin Trail. At just over 7 miles (11 km), this well-trodden, gravelly path offers the kind of adventurous landscape that’ll convert even the most committed urban runner to the trail life. You get to enter the wild through woods and fields, and up a few moderate ascents.There are cafes and water fountains along the way if you’re using this as a long run and need a breather – or ert into the park’s woodland garden Isabella Plantation so you can stop and smell the flowers.South Bank and Victoria Embankment loopThis swift jaunt around the Thames reminds me why I call London home. I like to time a run early enough to avoid the tourists, who love the South Bank in particular. For a 5K loop, start at Blackfriars station, run south over the bridge, take a right on Upper Ground, then take another a quick right on to Marigold Alley. You’ll hit the riverside, so turn left to follow the Thames and you’ll get to tread along a flat path as you fly past Oxo Tower, the National Theatre and the surprisingly sandy beaches you can spot at low tide near the Royal Festival Hall. You’ll also catch the bright lights of the London Eye, before climbing the steps on to Westminster Bridge. Turn right under Big Ben so you are now going eastwards on the north bank of the Thames along Victoria Embankment. Stay on the riverside pavement, so you don’t have to stop to cross roads and you can enjoy the great views of the Thames and the City beyond. Check out Cleopatra’s Needle and – on the left – Somerset House, before crossing over the road at Temple station. Continue along the Embankment before finishing up at the peaceful Middle Temple Gardens.Hampstead HeathSimilar to Richmond Park, Hampstead Heath is a leafy, countryside-esque destination that offers escapism from the bustle of the city – but it’s especially my go-to when I’m in the mood to tackle some ruthless hills or to get a bit muddy on the heath’s countless trails. For an obstacle-filled adventure, I like to start from Hampstead Heath overground station, and venture into the heath from South End Road. Follow the path and you’ll soon spot Hampstead No 1 and No 2 ponds – in the summer, you might even be tempted to have a dip. Keep going until you see the path that runs between the No 2 pond and the mixed bathing pond the terrain will become wilder as you start to make the taxing ascent to Parliament Hill. Catch your breath as you take in an impressive view of the capital – you should be able to make out the Gherkin, the Shard and St Pauls Cathedral in the distance. I might do a few hill reps here, then seek out the stunning Hill Garden and Pergola, a hidden gem on the west side of the heath.Victoria ParkLike many runners in east London, I’m a massive fan of Victoria Park. From its vast fields and leafy avenues to the top-notch cafes and restored bandstand, Bonner Bridge, the Burdett Coutts fountain and new play areas, London’s oldest park is still going strong. The terrain’s also nice and flat, which makes knocking out a speedy run such a pleasure. Made up of two parts split by Grove Road, a full lap of the park covers just over 4km (2.7 miles) – but if you have more in your legs, slip on to the Hertford Union canal for eclectic scenes of street art and houseboats as you make your way towards the Lee Navigation. For another change of scenery, you can peel off towards the Olympic Park en route for a calisthenics gym and art installations commemorating the legacy of the 2012 Olympics.Tower Bridge to Islands Gardens via the Thames PathThe London leg of the Thames Path, a pleasant national trail that follows the river, is 79.5 miles (128km) that’s usually tackled in four sections either north or south of the water. Though the entire route is a beaut, the 5-mile (8km) passage from Tower Bridge to Island Gardens is particularly fascinating. The first time I ran along it, I was riveted by how it unveiled the capital’s Victorian past. You’ll head through St Katherine’s Dock and Wapping along cobbled lanes, fly past Execution Dock where pirates were once hung, and be tempted to swing by the Prospect of Whitby pub, once frequented by Charles Dickens. From here, you’ll soon notice how the capital has evolved as you make your way through Limehouse, the glass and steel of Canary Wharf and eventually Island Gardens, where the multi-surface path officially ends.Crystal Palace ParkThe ladies from the Fly Girl Collective ran their first ever race here, so it’ll always be remembered as “very, very hard” – but in a good way. The mixed, hilly terrain of this south-east London park is one of the reasons why it’s a big hit with trail-loving runners. It’s got everything – cheeky hills, grassy and stony paths, and muddy puddles after the rain. Another draw, of course, is the Grade I-listed Dinosaur Court – a quirky collection of more than 30 dinosaur sculptures that have resided in the park since 1854. To see them in all their glory, enter the park from Thicket Road entrance on the south side and do a half a mile (0.8km) loop around Lower Lake. Then, explore the rest of the park by taking the 2.5-mile (4km) circuit around its periphery, taking on some challenging hills, or seek out the infamous Crystal Palace Park maze for a fun ersion before heading back south past the athletic stadium, to swing by the park’s charming urban farm – the goats are particularly curious about passing runners.The Fresh Foam X Hierro v5 is designed to go the distance.

Even so, there remain several significant last-eight details to be clarified, with an all-English showdown between Exeter and Saracens in April a genuine possibility.A humdinger of a Parisian contest between Racing 92 and Munster has also underlined what a serious handful France’s backs could be when England go to Stade de France to kick off their Six Nations campaign in three weeks’ time. For all Munster’s gallant defensive efforts, the firepower of Virimi Vakatawa and Teddy Thomas was ultimately too much for them.Racing 92’s 39-22 bonus-point win – and Munster’s lack of a bonus point – means a Saracens victory at home to Racing on Sunday should ensure they make the knockout stages as one of the three second-placed sides. Lose and Munster could still scrape in arithmetically but Ulster, Saracens and Northampton are probably the most likely to join the five who have already advanced.That list will be particularly galling for Munster, in danger of not featuring in the last eight for only the fourth time in 22 seasons. They will not be the first side, though, to be dazzled by Racing’s attacking brilliance in their indoor La Défense Arena. There will be no more eye‑catching pass all season than Teddy Iribaren’s reverse long ball to his similarly named colleague Thomas – two potential signings for the Bristol Bears, surely? – before half-time and few centres in the forthcoming Six Nations will be harder to stop than Vakatawa.If Champions Cup pool results are not an entirely definitive guide to Six Nations form, the sight of one of England’s top sides losing at home to Italian opposition in Europe’s flagship tournament with 10 minutes remaining also offered a reminder that nothing is entirely preordained.Despite a litany of wayward lineouts and other mistakes, however, the Saints managed to avoid becoming the first Premiership team to be beaten at home by Benetton Treviso for 20 years, courtesy of a barnstorming display from the colossal Taqele Naiyaravoro and a late try from Andy Symons.It still requires Northampton to win on Saturday in France where there has been one English win in the Champions Cup this season, by Exeter at La Rochelle. A similar challenge awaits Gloucester, whose 29-6 win over Montpellier at Kingsholm, with another impressive contribution from their teenage winger Louis Rees-Zammit, will count for nothing if they cannot overcome Toulouse, who are still unbeaten, on Sunday.Exeter’s 31-31 draw in Glasgow, however, was good enough to qualify the Chiefs as European pool winners for the first time in their history, with a home quarter-final at Sandy Park on offer if they beat La Rochelle in Devon this Saturday. Top of the Premiership and in charge of their own destiny in Europe, Rob Baxter’s side are now within touching distance of securing the first home draw by an English team other than Saracens for four seasons.There could also be an all-English quarter-final should the Chiefs finish with a bonus-point flourish against La Rochelle and Saracens beat Racing. Only two weeks ago Saracens went down to the south-west and their domestic punishment for breaching the Premiership salary cap has added further spice to the rivalry. The defending European and English champions, however, will derive plenty of confidence from the resilience they showed in Swansea on Saturday, their depleted side recovering from the sending‑off of the young Welsh prop Rhys Carré after five minutes to win 22-15. A draw against Racing will be enough to see off Munster but Saracens, as always, will aim higher.Make it through and they will ensure the presence of virtually all the pre-tournament pool favourites who stood out before the competition commenced. Among them, inevitably, are Leinster, convincing if not entirely fluent 42-14 winners over Lyon, who now need to win in Treviso on Saturday to be confirmed as top quarter-final seeds.The Irish province stand with Toulouse as the only side to have won their first five pool games and they have yet to be beaten in a competitive fixture this season. A quarter-final in Dublin is as daunting an assignment as any in Europe these days, regardless of whether Glasgow, Gloucester or Saints win the scramble for the final qualifying berth.Glasgow have the most to do, their exciting draw against Exeter not quite enough to transform their prospects. Had Stuart Hogg’s last‑minute penalty attempt from 60 metres not bounced back off the bar, they would have been dead already but there is still a faint glimmer of hope if they overcome Sale at the AJ Bell Stadium and the results in Lyon and Toulouse go their way.Northampton boss Chris Boyd apologised for a “disgustingly dreadful” performance as Benetton Rugby were edged 33-20 at Franklin’s Gardens. Saints kept alive their ambition of qualifying for the Heineken Champions Cup quarter-finals by registering a bonus-point victory, but Boyd was appalled by the quality of the display. “That was a disgustingly dreadful performance. Anyone with any respect for the game would be horrified by that performance from both sides,” Boyd said.Max Deegan says Leinster are fiercely determined to complete one of their season goals and secure top seeding for the next round. Number eight Deegan was a try scorer and the eventual man of the match in Leinster’s 42-14 bonus-point win over Lyon at the RDS. “We’ve always been looking for the top seeding in the competition. We knew if we were going to get that top seeding that we’d have to win every game, so we’ll be looking to do the same next week,” said Deegan.In the Challenge Cup, England fly-half George Ford scored two drop goals as Leicester Tigers powered their way past Cardiff Blues and booked their place in the quarter-finals. Ford also converted tries by Simon Lewis, Jordan Olowofela and Ben White and kicked a penalty on his way to a personal tally of 15 points as the Tigers clinched top spot in Pool Five with a 30-20 win at Welford Road.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPA Media"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78af3fceb6e24916aadfd08dfa9a6603e6671f53/0_90_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84c6885396ccb8ae576e5d2107b34f8e","title":"rafael nadal atp cup davis cup tennis","story":"Rafael Nadal says there is no room in tennis for both the Davis Cup and the new ATP Cup, and has urged administrators to create one “big world team cup competition” in their place.Over 10 days in three venues on either side of this sprawling, hurting continent, nearly 220,000 fans gave the latest iteration of team tennis a qualified welcome as 24 nations and nearly 120 players competed for a prize with no history but much promise. It ended with Serbia being crowned champions.However, like the new-format Davis Cup finals in Madrid less than two months ago, it was an imperfect success. If Spain got a B+, Australia probably did too, in more trying circumstances and vastly different conditions. But this is a phoney war that surely cannot last.Both are admirable dreams, of course – just flawed in concept, delivery and scheduling. They reflect the ersity of a fast-changing world, with ethnicity and passion moving across boundaries with all the unstoppable force of nature. It is the human element of jealousy and power-mongering that has prevented a compromise.In a country where sport is as much an addiction as a religion – a true opiate of the masses – the support of fans otherwise distracted by the heat, wind and fire that have devastated Australia for months was a welcome constant. It was also as mixed as vegetables in a pot, much of it springing from roots far away.Indeed, it has seemed at moments that a disproportionate slice of the 70,000 Serbian diaspora had descended on the venues in Brisbane and here in Sydney, which played a significant part in their semi-final win over Russia, and was raucous again in Sundaynight’s final, although there were plenty of Spaniards to counterpunch in kind.In the 108th edition of the Davis Cup, rebranded as the World Cup of Tennis, 18 countries were crammed into three courts in Madrid for a week. It was ludicrously ambitious and some matches finished closer to breakfast the following morning than the last train home at night.Total attendance was hard to pin down but some estimates put it at around 140,000 – 80,000 fewer than the ATP Cup. On day one in Madrid and in the final, the hosts had no problem filling the main arena, which holds 12,000, while the two smaller courts, of 3,500 and 2,500, too often echoed to the dreaded curse of unsold seats.There were small crowds here, too, in the round-robin matches but, once the caravan left Perth and Brisbane for the knockout stages in Sydney, the atmosphere improved noticeably. While there were matches where complimentary tickets looked to be padding the numbers, the enthusiasm was genuine and the tennis was often superb, rarely dull.Whether it was better trying to squeeze six groups of three into three courts in Madrid or spread six groups of four across an entire country is a tough call.Neither strategy is ideal. The only venues big enough to bring so many teams and players together are at the grand slam tournaments and, until either or both of the ATP and the ITF build a dedicated site for team finals – or Nadal’s World Team Cup – the anomaly will persist. If the era of home-and-away is dead, a lasting and workable alternative is needed.The first ATP Cup was saved by the players. There have been heroes on show nearly every day and every night: Alex de Minaur, Nick Kyrgios, Dan Evans, Dusan Lajovic, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Denis Shapovalov, Roberto Bautista Agut, Daniil Medvedev. All brought their magic to the entertainment.The team zones, parked in the corners just yards from the baseline, gave the action lively relevance, a noises-off chorus for the main antagonists. The bank of statistics available to coaches and squad members were useful, if not universally embraced. Djokovic revealed he had brought his own. And there have been inexplicable failures, such as the world No 7, Alexander Zverev, who had a total meltdown and will do well to recover in time for Melbourne.There were some spectacular tantrums. Medvedev bashed the umpire’s chair with his racket, like a five-year-old demanding sweets. Shapovalov swore at the Serbian crowd, with justification – and the umpire, Carlos Bernardes, told them to “go home” if they couldn’t be quiet.Dan Evans gave the Australian crowd a burst of Birmingham invective they no doubt were familiar with. Tsitsipas’s mother told him off for accidentally hitting his father with his racket. And several other rackets met a messy end, as ever. Some things in tennis never change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3305ecdbbb1493e895a17737abd7d1764dc6ac41/0_0_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=610fe9ab58170df741789ce50eebe750","title":"doctor who recap series 38 episode three orphan 55","story":"It’s Thunberg time! The Doctor channeled her inner eco champion in a thrilling, prescient mission – with added mutants Doctor Who, more than ever in the Chibnall era, has rarely shied away from thumping political tubs. This week might just raise the bar to its highest. Orphan 55 is not exactly subtle about its climate crisis message, but writer Ed Hime has a blast getting there, with a zingy script about an apocalyptic future Earth brought low by “global warming, the food chain collapses, mass migration and war” and populated by horrific, fanged mutants known as the Dregs.The episode is ostensibly about the Doctor enjoying an idyllic holiday (always watch out for those) at the salubrious Tranquility Spa, but it quickly descends into a nightmare, with an adorable elderly couple coming along for the ride. The whole caper ends up having being sparked by a somewhat unnecessary spat between a mother and daughter, but you sometimes need those kinds of narrative engines to move things a step closer to armageddon. Orphan 55 might sound like a gloomfest. But, as the Doctor is keen to point out to the “fam”, “this is just one possible future”. It’s made abundantly clear that none of this really needs to happen if we take the right action (guess we’re all Thunbergs now). But it does make you wonder if the fate of all doomed planets is reversible. Gallifrey, anyone?The romantic spark between Ryan and Yaz is still flickering, with the latter taking an incredibly dim view of the former’s connection with Bella.

Tosin Cole is little further on with his Sheffield accent, but we can’t have everything we want.In the pre-series publicity, we got a look at some pretty terrifying monsters. The Dregs prove a triumph in both concept and prosthetic execution, plus that scene with the transporter vessel is sure to go down in scarelore.No sign of Hot Camp Master this week, which was probably to be expected. But the flashback scenes to a burning Earth were surely some kind of foreshadowing to Gallifrey and what went on.

As tremors shook the area on Sunday, volcanic lightning flickered in the column of steam and ash.The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) raised its alert level to 4 out of 5 – meaning “hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours to days”.Phivolcs also warned of possible hazards of a volcanic tsunami and rapid currents of hot gas and volcanic matter that could hit areas around Lake Taal, a popular weekend getaway from Manila.Evacuation of about 8,000 residents from the volcano island and other high-risk towns is under way, with about 6,000 already out of the danger zone by early Sunday evening, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council told reporters.Ash fell as far away as Manila, prompting the suspension of flights at the capital’s busy international airport. General manager Ed Monreal said the suspension would continue into Monday because there was ash on the runway.Local authorities cancelled school classes scheduled for Monday and urged people to stay indoors.President Rodrigo Duterte had instructed authorities to move people within the perimeter of Taal out of the danger zone, his spokesman said in a statement.The ash plume was clearly visible from the nearby city of Tagaytay, a popular viewing spot for the volcano.Jon Patrick Yen, who was at a restaurant in Tagaytay at the time, said: “We were having lunch when we heard rumbling. We saw the volcano erupting. It rained and some small pebbles fell to the ground.“I did not expect to see such spectacle. We just went by to eat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/380d19ce68069c6573e265848aba3c7717672090/0_0_1890_1134/master/1890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6b5e28bd7cb6cf508ee2ee2de8369ed","title":"drag queen storytime at brisbane library disrupted by rightwing student group","story":"Protesters from University of Queensland Liberal National Cub – disendorsed by the LNP – yell at performers, leaving children in tearsA rightwing University of Queensland student group has been caught on film attacking a drag queen storytelling event at a Brisbane library.In videos posted online on Sunday, the small group of students can be heard yelling “Drag queens are not for kids” at the event at the Brisbane Square library on Sunday morning. The event was organised with Rainbow Families Queensland and was hosted by two drag performers, Queeny and Diamond.One half of the Veronicas, Jess Origliasso, posted two videos of the protest on Instagram, telling her 319,000 followers she was “heartbroken and furious”.The protest was organised by the UQ Liberal National Club, whose president, Wilson Gavin, can be seen in the video. The club is no longer linked to the Liberal National party, which last month resolved to disendorse it.Security and police were called after the protest, which occurred at the end of the event.“This was planned and targeted at me. It hurt and affected so many others. I am sorry.”Rainbow Families Queensland said children attending the event had been enjoying it until the protest. The event has been held four times in Brisbane over the past two years without incident.“Love makes a family,” said the Rainbow Families Queensland coordinator, Holly Zwalf. “There’s no room for hate in our hearts.” “The small group of people involved in this completely inappropriate display do not in any way represent how we as a council and the LNP feels, and it will not and never will be tolerated. “They are not a part of the LNP.”In a Facebook post, the UQ Liberal National Club said the protest was about “taking a stand against a corrosive gender ideology” and that the group had left when directed by security."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4137418.1578841130!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"megxit markle should wield her wokeness where it matters buckingham palace","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex leave Westminster Abbey in London after attending a Commonwealth Day service last March. Photograph: Ben StansallAFPI never had much use for the queen. Maybe it’s the Irish in me. As Winston Churchill said: “We’ve always found the Irish a bit odd. They refuse to be English.” Or maybe it’s the American in me. We did go to an awful lot of trouble to break away from that corgi-and-gin-loving racket 244 years ago. At some visceral level, though, America must regret being torn away from the royal family. How else to explain our enduring fascination with dynasties? Having spent my career covering four dysfunctional political dynasties, I rebel more than ever at the idea that biology entitles you to authority.The ghost of Diana gone rogue animates the fractured fairy tale of Meghan and Harry, and their intemperate attempt to upend centuries of starchy rules and break away from the Firm. Princess Di’s dangerous tango with the tabloids left Harry with no taste to play that game again, especially with streaks of racism against Markle added to the mix. He recently confessed that every click or flash of a camera brought memories of his mother’s death racing back into his mind.US visitI covered Diana’s first trip as the Princess of Wales to America in 1985. She seemed happy then, in that year before Charles resumed his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles. She and the prince shared amused eye contact, winks and teasing remarks.Nancy Reagan planned an evening of candlelit dancing at the White House worthy of a 24-year-old Cinderella in a midnight blue velvet gown. The first lady arranged for the Marine Band to play Night Fever as John Travolta spun a euphoric Diana around the floor. (“She’s a great little mover,” he said afterwards.)I wondered how Prince Charles would deal with a young wife with so much star power, absorbing so much attention. We were all mesmerised when she tucked her chin down in that shy pose and cast that modest yet saucy look up at us. The answer was: he did not deal with it well. Twelve years later, when the unimaginable tragedy hit, the royal ice cubes were furious at the expectation that they should emote for the woman who had publicly ripped the monarchy as a bloodless, soulless gang and christened herself the Prisoner of Wales.The Firm was out of its depth then, and it is again now. How can the queen and Prince Philip and Prince Charles possibly understand the desire of Meghan and Harry to rebrand as a Goopish lifestyle enterprise? The news that they have applied to trademark hundreds of items, from socks to hoodies, under the “Sussex Royal” logo makes Wallis Simpson’s exile in the Bahamas, spent matching the colour on the walls to her face powder, seem positively monastic.Can you really call yourself “financially independent” when all you’re doing is cashing in on the royal name? Given the state of the world and the implosion of the British empire – with Scots once more contemplating an off ramp, Irish unity in play, Australia on fire and Boris Johnson tricking the queen into suspending parliament in a Brexit ploy – it is hard to feel sorry for the Duchess of Sussex complaining that her diamonds are heavy. The pathos for Markle, trapped in a designer cage, goes only so far.It’s easy for royals to come to North America, where they are lavishly embraced as celebrities without all those pesky restrictions about class and role. (See The Crown episode about a wild, imbibing Princess Margaret charming LBJ.) Still, I think Meghan Markle should have wielded her wokeness where it is most needed – in Buckingham Palace. She could have channelled the Obamas, who did a magnificent job of rising above racist taunts and working within the institution to imprint a new image of racial possibility in America.Markle had already successfully brought a refreshing dose of semi-radical chic to the royal family. Her visits to a mosque that housed Londoners displaced by the Grenfell Tower fire led to her putting out a 2018 cookbook, the proceeds of which went to the victims.Irish visitAt its best, the monarchy has been able to lift up people, as it did during the blitz in the second World War. I saw that ability to alchemise emotions and opinions when I covered the queen on her visit to Ireland in 2011, the first by a British monarch in a century. It was impossible not to be impressed watching her speak Irish and offering regret about how Britain had made Ireland suffer, bowing her head at the scene of Bloody Sunday and the Garden of Remembrance, the sacred ground for slain Irish patriots.The Irish started out sceptical, but by the end of her visit, many were calling her “Betty” on Twitter. The queen of England holds out the idea that she and her family should have some sort of vestigial moral authority. But with the Prince Andrew imbroglio in the seraglio of Jeffrey Epstein, and with Harry’s run for the Hollywood Hills, it is clear that many in her family are not interested in moral authority.The collapse of the authority of the British monarchy mirrors the collapse of authorities generally, scarred by years of scandals about clergymen abusing children, athletes beating up girlfriends and university officials accepting bribes. And yet, even if the royals’ role in the culture is now akin to the Kardashians, it wasn’t cool for Meghan and Harry to pants the 93-year-old queen, defy her instructions, dump their Megxit plan on Instagram and intensify the sad split between the brothers.

His home had been flattened in the massive earthquake which hit Haiti ten years ago on Sunday, killing over 300,000 people. He heard word that there was space to live up in the hills, in an area on the outskirts of Port au Prince known as Canaan.And so he collected the remnants of his life in the impoverished Delmas 4 district, and moved up into the hills with his family.“But there was nothing here,” he recalls. “We arrived, and there was no one from the government. So we just asked around to find a free spot, and called it our own. We just had to guess how big an area we could claim.”The 7.0 magnitude earthquake that rocked Haiti 10 years ago wiped out almost a fifth of government employees, and left 1.5 million homeless.Cholera broke out, introduced to the country by UN peacekeepers, which killed 10,000 people and infected 800,000 more.Aid money poured into the Caribbean nation, and Bill Clinton – who spent his 1975 honeymoon with Hillary in Haiti – was made co-chair of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC). Sean Penn became the unofficial mayor of a homeless camp Oprah Winfrey and Kim Kardashian jetted in to see for themselves.The fallout from the 2010 earthquake continues todayTen years later, Haitians shake their heads sadly and wonder where it all went wrong.There was so much energy, attention, and money - $13 billion (£10bn) promised in the years 2010-20, of which half was actually distributed. An additional $3 billion was contributed to UN agencies and NGOs by private donors, meaning that the $9 billion in aid was three times the revenue of the government of Haiti between 2010 and 2012.Yet 35,000 people still live in temporary accommodation, according to the International Organisation of Migration. In reality the figure is likely to be significantly higher, as people are classed as being housed even when living in a shack  Canaan is still home to around 200,000 people, who still don’t have running water or electricity.“They wanted us to move here, but they didn’t help us,” said Mr Appolos, 52, with a shrug.He founded a school in the new community, built from plywood and corrugated iron, and funded entirely from donations made by Haitians living in the area. Now 300 students attend his tiny make-shift study centre.Half-built houses litter the hillsides many began building, but run out of money to complete it. A small one-room breezeblock building would cost around $1,000 to make, he estimated.Haiti was initially flooded with celebrities and goodwill, but much of the promised money has failed to materialise“It’s been very, very hard to find a way to build,” he said. “We had to do it all ourselves.”When the earthquake hit, Enancy Bienaime\u0027s house folded on top of her like it was made of playing cards. For three hours she was trapped in the rubble her desperate cries eventually led neighbours to dig her out. For two years she then lived in a tent – one of thousands pitched on the marshy wastelands on the outskirts of Haiti’s capital, Port au Prince.“Life has only got worse since then,” she said.She showed The  the corrugated iron shed where she now lives with her husband and two children, built on the site of their former home.That house, in Cite Soleil, the largest slum in the northern hemisphere, was built in the 1950s by Voodoo doctor Francois Papa Doc Duvalier, who ruled the country with an iron fist for 15 years. Now it is home to 265,000 people, crammed into an area only eight miles square and without sewers, running water or social services. A fetid, rubbish-filled canal provides the only drainage, and frequently floods into the slums. Pigs wallow in the mud, and squeal inside the ruins which still line the streets.“This house is terrible, even compared to my previous one,” said Mrs Bienaime, 35. “It’s so hot, with the corrugated iron roof. And I know it could topple at any time. I’m constantly frightened.”A man sells ice cream to children in the Carradeux communityThe earthquake and its immense challenges created huge political problems, which have fuelled the rise of gangs across the country. The gangs are paid by political and business interests, to corral votes or control a zone fights for territory are fierce.Cite Soleil is among the most hotly-contested territory for the gangs. “There are nine year olds around here with guns,” said Mrs Bienaime. “My one year old daughter has seen so many shootings she now makes a pistol sign with her fingers, and a ‘pow, pow’ noise. It breaks my heart. I’m desperate to move away from here.”Kwanli Kladstrup, country director for Irish NGO Concern, runs a programme to help reduce the risks of natural disasters, ensure the protection of children, and build sustainable livelihoods. Her team proudly tell how they educate their community about surviving earthquakes and hurricanes, demonstrating hiding under tables, and sheltering in doorways.A woman walks past the ruins of Notre Dame Cathedral during Haiti\u0026#39s 10th earthquake anniversary“There have been some improvements since the earthquake, but the endemic poverty continues to push people to the limit of their coping abilities, and hinder progress,” she said.She points out that hunger is a very real problem. OCHA, the UN humanitarian agency, estimates that four million people will need emergency food rations by March.“We have to focus on increasing investment in sustainable food systems and agriculture, and developing local markets to raise productivity,” she said.Janvier Junior, 33, agreed. Born in the slum, he has never seen things so bad. Rampant inflation coupled with rising unemployment have made an already tough life almost impossible.“We really thought, after the earthquake, that we’d have a fresh start,” he said. “We hoped some of the money would be put to good use. But we’re worse off than ever.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security British soldiers used \u0026#39Dragons’ Den\u0026#39 committees to identify rapid improvements for tanksVictims waiting up to three years for justice amid cutsThe New Pope, review: it\u0026#39s Jude Law vs John Malkovich in this deeply weird papal dramaThief stole ancient stones used to build Stonehenge to use as garden ornamentComment: Sorry, Harry and Meghan.

At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How did things get so bad in my kitchen?’ asks food writer Julia Platt LeonardI avoid cleaning my refrigerator like other people put off doing their taxes. I wait until it’s a sea of plastic containers, cling-film-wrapped onion halves, teetering jars – until I can’t find the mayonnaise or remember where the parmesan cheese is. Only then, when I can’t fit another thing inside, do I take it all out.\u0026nbspI throw out the piece of salmon skin I was going to give to the dogs. I toss out something spore-covered (carrots? meatballs?) and another item I think used to be a solid but is now liquid. Judging by the amount of mould, you’d think I was starting up a penicillin laboratory.And each time I chuck out an uneaten leftover or a floppy cucumber I feel ashamed – ashamed at the waste. As a food writer, I know better.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, about one third of the food produced in the world – a whopping 1.3 billion tonnes – is wasted or lost. In richer countries we waste as much food as sub-Saharan Africa produces. I’ve interviewed farmers, written about food policy and yet I’m part of the problem.I see myself standing before a food waste deity (picture Greta Thunberg with a white beard) and am forced to look at the piles of food I’ve wasted. It’s not a pretty picture. How did things get so bad in my kitchen?Why I’ve decided to start cycling to workI went to cooking school and worked in professional kitchens so FIFO – “first-in, first-out” – was my mantra. Food came in and we prepared and served it to ensure that waste was kept to a minimum. We labelled containers and made prep lists so nothing was missed. The walk-in fridge was kept clean, for hygiene reasons of course, but also so we knew what we had and ordered accordingly. My fridge? A disaster zone.I wasn’t raised to waste. My maternal grandparents came from western Kentucky, got married during the depression, and would no sooner have wasted a morsel of food than they would have walked down the street naked. When things were really tight, my grandmother reused coffee grounds and gave cucina povera a decidedly southern twist. My mother was the same, serving a meal one night, leftovers the next, and if necessary ‘must-go’ servings on the third.Food that’s not eaten either goes down the drain, is incinerated or ends up on a landfill where greenhouse gases are generated. That’s waste. But it’s also a waste because land, water, labour and energy were spent to create the food I binned. It’s also food that could have fed other people.My food waste, whether it’s the mystery container wedged in the back of the fridge or the past-sell-by date beans on my cupboard shelves, must stop. That’s why I’ve committed to reducing my food waste in 2020.Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThat means getting a handle on what comes in my kitchen and what goes back out. It also means taking a critical look at the food choices I’m making. If I want my kitchen to be more sustainable then it’s time to ask some tough questions. Where do the foods I eat come from? What impact do they make on the earth? Can I justify eating avocados or pouring almond milk on my cereal? And the elephant – scratch that, cow – in the room, can I be an ethical omnivore?I’m going to learn more about food labelling to find out what it tells us, and what it doesn’t. I’ll figure out how to cut down on plastic in my kitchen and waste in my cooking. I’ll embrace my leftovers and think before I buy.I’ll make my kitchen and my cooking more sustainable in 2020, one meal at a time.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’m not an idiot.’”Created with Sketch.19 films to look out for in 2020 Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter.

But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)Kaluuya’s comments come amid a backlash surrounding the 2020 Baftas, after it emerged that not a single non-white actor had been nominated at this year’s ceremony.\u0026nbspAmong the stars snubbed despite collecting awards and nominations in other ceremonies this year were Jennifer Lopez for Hustlers, Eddie Murphy for Dolemite Is My Name, Lupita Nyong’o for Us, Antonio Banderas for Pain \u0026amp Glory and Cynthia Erivo for Harriet.Kaluuya, who grew up on an estate in Kentish Town, London, also suggested that he is “confusing” to people in the US because Americans are used to being sold British exports such as Downton Abbey and The Crown.\u0026nbsp“There’s Brand Britain, so there’s an awareness that I’m British, but they don’t know me. I’m just seen as privileged because I have an English accent,” he said.Baftas spark backlash after not nominating a single non-white actorMartin Scorsese: ‘At this vantage point of age, you have to let go’Kaluuya was nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars, Golden Globes, Baftas and Screen Actors Guild Awards for his performance in Get Out.Among his forthcoming projects are Queen \u0026amp Slim – a film about a black couple who go on the run after shooting a police officer in self-defence – and a currently untitled movie about murdered activist Fred Hampton.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I actually want to be a citizen in this country not a subject.“I want my community to have real say and real power over its lives.\u0026nbsp I think that is entirely acceptable… There are democracies all over the world where they do not have a royal family.“But that shouldn’t be for me as leader, or as prime minister one day, to dictate what happen. That should be for the people of this country to have a say.”Mr Lewis said that a successful motion at last year’s Labour conference to abolish private schools should become party policy.“Private schools are an engine of inequality,” he said.“I understand that lots of people out there send their children to private school for a variety of reasons and there are private schools in my own constituency where I go and talk to the students and those schools are fantastic but I would like that standard for every child in this country.“It shouldn’t just be determined by the fact that you have the money to be able to pay for your child to have that quality of education, it should be available to everyone.“I think that ision in our society set at an early age has consequences for the inequality that we have, not just in terms of wealth but of power as well and I think that’s a very good policy. I think it’s one that could be communicated perhaps in a better way but ultimately, yes, I do support it.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I didn’t say they should be abolished, I have lots of respect for the hard work they do. I simply think the question about their size and the money they receive should be one for the public.

Some said it was a potentially positive step for democracy – a sign, as Donald Trump put it, that the will of the people will always prevail.\u0026nbspA sharply different response came from senator Bernie Sanders, who immediately condemned what appears to be a coup. The ousted leader, Evo Morales, who had challenged term limits to remain in power, later thanked the senator from Vermont and Democratic\u0026nbsppresidential candidate, referring to him affectionately as brother.Most of Mr Sanders\u0027 rivals paid little attention to the incident in a faraway place. But for Mr Sanders, the episode offered a glimpse into an unorthodox foreign policy worldview – anchored by a passionate opposition to US\u0026nbspmilitary interventions – that has been overshadowed by his famously liberal domestic policy agenda.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWith the Iran crisis thrusting foreign affairs to the forefront of the campaign, just as Mr Sanders rises in early state polls, Democrats who previously waved off the senator\u0027s views as fringe ideas now must contemplate the possibility of a democratic socialist becoming commander in chief of the United States. Mr Trump has already upended the world order with an America First approach that tests Western alliances, and Mr Sanders would deliver another jolt – echoing some of Mr Trump\u0027s criticisms of military actions and free trade but realigning the country\u0027s priorities even more thoroughly.Beyond his objection to Mr Morales\u0027 removal, Mr Sanders has pointedly declined to label Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro a dictator. He called Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu a racist, and has campaigned with representatives\u0026nbspRashida Tlaib\u0026nbspand Ilhan Omar\u0026nbspvocal supporters of a controversial Israel boycott movement. He said China has done more to address extreme poverty than any country in the history of civilisation.Created with Sketch.US airstrike kills Iran\u0027s Qassem Soleimani: Fallout in pictures Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This photo released by the Iraqi Prime Minister Press Office shows a burning vehicle at the Baghdad International Airport following an airstrike in Baghdad, Iraq, early Friday 3 JanuaryThe wreckage of the car in which general Soleimani was travelling when a targeted US airstrike struck outside Baghdad International Airport on 3 JanuaryDemonstrators burn the US and British flags during a protest in Tehran after general Soleimani was killed in a targeted airstrike by American forcesA burning vehicle at the Baghdad International Airport following an airstrike.

You\u0027ve had a consensus in this country on certain principles. Joe Biden represents that consensus. And to a degree, Obama as well.Even some Democrats note that Mr Sanders has put much more emphasis on domestic policies than global ones. It hasn\u0027t been his strong suit, senator\u0026nbspRichard Durbin said of Mr Sanders\u0027 foreign policy.\u0026nbspMr Sanders and his supporters say he\u0027s been right on foreign policy far more than the supposed experts, and that the establishment is responsible for a series of misguided military adventures. Besides, they say, Mr Sanders\u0027 positions are often more nuanced than he\u0027s given credit for – he has criticised Mr Morales and Mr Maduro, for example, even while questioning the wisdom of removing them.Democrats and Republicans are equally incompetent over SoleimaniWhat were the two major foreign policy blunders in our lifetimes? Help me out here. What were they? Vietnam was one, and Iraq was the other, Mr Sanders said Saturday at a town hall in Newton, Iowa. I marched against the war in Vietnam. I was a kid. As a United States congressman in 2002, 2003, I helped lead the effort to prevent us from invading Iraq.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMr Sanders\u0027 campaign declined to make him available for an interview. In a statement, Mr Sanders\u0027 national policy director Josh Orton said: Washington\u0027s foreign policy establishment has been consistently wrong, and that a Sanders administration would begin to repair the damage done by Trump.Mr Sanders, 78, was strongly influenced by the Reagan-era US\u0026nbspinterventions in Latin America, which appalled many liberals. Those years also influenced his broader approach to the region, which stands apart from many Democrats. Mr Sanders was at odds with many in the party last year, for example, when he refused to call Mr Maduro a dictator, even as he made critical comments about the authoritarian socialist leader.His comments about Mr\u0026nbspMorales, whose success lifting Bolivians into the middle class made him an iconic figure among socialists, also stood out. At a Univision forum, Mr Sanders praised Mr Morales for addressing poverty and empowering indigenous people. He added that it was fair to question whether he should have stayed in power so long – almost 14 years – but it was a far less critical approach than other Democrats took towards a man whom many viewed as increasingly authoritarian.Mr Sanders has been accused by members of both parties of not being tough enough on repressive socialist regimes. He\u0027s not going to pretend we face remotely equivalent threats from left-wing authoritarianism than from right-wing authoritarianism, said a senior Sanders aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to be candid.When he ran for president four years ago, Mr Sanders often appeared unprepared for a rigorous foreign policy debate. Facing opponent Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, he often sidestepped questions about specific global challenges.\u0026nbspFollowing his loss, Mr Sanders sought to shore up his foreign policy credentials. After the 2016 election, he hired Matt Duss, who has helped the candidate with his foreign policy chops. Now his top foreign policy hand – and seen inside Mr Sanders\u0027 world as a potential future national security adviser –Mr\u0026nbspDuss rose from blogging about policy to helming the Foundation for Middle East Peace.\u0026nbspIn the years after his loss to Ms Clinton, Mr Sanders delivered some lengthy speeches on foreign policy, including one at Westminster College in Missouri, where Winston Churchill gave his famous Iron Curtain address.\u0026nbspThat 2017 Sanders speech encapsulated much of his thinking on world affairs, people close to him said. In it, he tethered his foreign policy vision to his populist domestic agenda, declaring, We cannot convincingly promote democracy abroad if we do not live it vigorously here at home.Mr Sanders argued that the events of the past two decades have discredited the notion that the US\u0026nbspshould use its military might to shape the world to its liking. He decried US\u0026nbspinterference in Iran and Chile in the 20th century. He underlined the need for alliances to confront adversaries such as North Korea. On a smaller scale, he touted the value of partnering with a sister city in Russia when he was mayor of Burlington, Vermont.\u0026nbspMany Democrats remain unimpressed. On the campaign trail, Mr Sanders has increasingly clashed with Mr Biden, who touts his extensive foreign policy experience in the Senate and Obama administration.David Lammy, the\u0026nbspBritish MP, who has gotten to know Mr Sanders in recent years, noted that Sanders\u0027 views would fit more comfortably in a typical European centre-left party. Whether he were in Germany or France or the UK, of course, Bernie, his politics would be very familiar and probably quite mainstream, Mr\u0026nbspLammy said.He added, Clearly, in the US\u0026nbspcontext, it has been a slightly different experience.While Mr Sanders\u0027 unorthodox views make some Democrats nervous, the most pointed hostility comes from Republicans. Asked what he thinks of Mr Sanders\u0027 foreign policy platform, senator\u0026nbspThom Tillis said, A disaster.\u0026nbspStanding next to him in an elevator in the Capitol Building was senator\u0026nbspRick Scott\u0026nbspwho chuckled and interjected, Does he have a foreign policy?\u0026nbspYet this is a time of foreign policy upheaval in both parties. Mr Trump himself has upended decades of Republican thinking, praising figures such as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while questioning the role of Nato. A populist non-interventionism is surging in both parties, championed by figures such as representative\u0026nbspTulsi Gabbard and senator Rand Paul.That has given Mr\u0026nbspSanders a sometimes surprising array of foreign policy partners on Capitol Hill. He teamed up with senator Mike Lee, a conservative Republican from Utah, on a measure to end US support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. Their legislation passed the Senate and forced Mr Trump to issue his second veto.\u0026nbspSanders introduces law to stop Trump from starting war with IranOn Saturday, Mr Lee signed onto Mr Sanders\u0027 bill to prevent Mr Trump from deploying funds for military action against Iran without congressional approval.Other alliances have been more controversial. Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida\u0026nbspTlaib, who have endorsed Mr Sanders for president, strongly support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement to pressure Israel over its policies towards Palestinians.\u0026nbspMany Democrats and Republicans, including some who have criticised Israeli policies, object to the BDS movement as going too far. To me, BDS has no place, said senator Ben Cardin, formerly the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\u0026nbspMr Sanders himself does not support the BDS movement. But he has been a vocal critic of Mr Netanyahu, and he has said he is willing to make foreign aid to Israel contingent on fostering more peaceful relations with Palestinians, a condition many Democrats and Republicans are unwilling to impose.\u0026nbspWhen it comes to international trade, Mr Sanders opposes an emerging US\u0026nbspdeal with Mexico and Canada, arguing that it does not go far enough in protecting American jobs. The deal has the support of the union AFL-CIO and\u0026nbspElizabeth Warren among others on the left.To some moderate Democrats, including senator\u0026nbspJon Tester of Montana, Mr Sanders\u0027 message at times can resemble the current president\u0027s promises to avoid needless wars. Kind of like Trump? Mr Tester mused in a brief interview at the Capitol. Mr Sanders\u0027 identification as a democratic socialist is something he has to overcome in his pitch to be commander in chief, Mr Tester added.Trade politics also ided Mr Sanders and\u0026nbspBarack Obama. He may have more differences with Obama on foreign policy than Trump, is the great irony, said John Cavanagh, who has known Mr Sanders since 1991 and directs the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal think tank. Both he and Trump can sit down with workers in the Midwest. It\u0027s just that one does it in a racist and xenophobic way.But Mr Sanders has his stark differences with Mr Trump as well. The senator from Vermont was a lonely voice opposing the most recent defence spending bill. And Mr Sanders favours international diplomacy to tackle big issues such as the Paris climate accord.Until recently, Mr Sanders\u0027 proposals have been overshadowed by his sweeping domestic agenda. But the US\u0026nbspkilling of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani prompted Mr Sanders to amplify the linchpin of his foreign agenda: his long-standing opposition to US\u0026nbspintervention abroad.\u0026nbspNews of the airstrike came late 2 January, after Mr Sanders had spent the day campaigning in Iowa. Inside a restaurant at the Doubletree Hotel in Cedar Rapids, Mr Sanders huddled with aides including campaign manager Faiz Shakir and his deputy, Ari Rabin-Havt, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Mr\u0026nbspDuss, the foreign policy adviser, joined by phone. Together, they crafted a statement calling the killing an assassination and drew a connection to the instability caused by the Iraq War.\u0026nbspIt gives me no pleasure to tell you at this moment we face a similar crossroads fraught with danger, he said the next day during a town hall meeting at the National Motorcycle Museum in Anamosa, Iowa, delivering a speech he wrote and then revised on the drive from the hotel, according to the aide with knowledge of the situation.For some at the town hall, his aversion to military conflict resonated. We\u0027ve been through this in the past, said Thomas Wiand, 51. We went through unnecessary wars continually.Against all odds, it looks like Bernie Sanders might be the nomineeOthers were more cautious. Sometimes you have to go and do what needs to be done to correct the situation, said Craig Bruxvoort, 62, a grain farmer who applauded Mr Trump for ordering general Soleimani\u0027s killing.\u0026nbspThose who have worked with Mr\u0026nbspSanders on foreign policy describe him as methodical and inquisitive. Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment who is advising Mr Sanders on Iran, recalled him asking specific questions about the consequences of general Soleimani\u0027s killing.\u0026nbspA lot of the questions focused on the internal political dynamics in Iran: What are the likely scenarios that will now emerge? How will it affect those who are moderates in Iran? Ms DiMaggio said.\u0026nbspBen Rhodes, who served as deputy national security adviser under Mr Obama, remembered briefing Mr Sanders on the Iran nuclear deal for about an hour,\u0026nbspas the senator fired questions his way.A more vivid memory for Mr Rhodes was how Mr Sanders was affected by talking to veterans and family members of soldiers killed in combat.\u0026nbspI remember him telling me once, he said, \u0027Obama doesn\u0027t get enough credit for how many troops Obama took out from Afghanistan,\u0027 said Mr Rhodes, who has offered informal advice to Mr Sanders and other candidates. And Bernie measured that by not having to attend as many funerals in Vermont.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He didn’t. He thought he’d be able to keep his royal protection officers. He couldn’t.He thought he’d be found a job befitting his status once the dust settled. No dice. He lived in hope that he could die in the country he once ruled. Not a chance.Soit all falls apart and Harry thinks he can come home again, he’d better check the history books.And Meghan should take a good look, too. The Windsors lived in France surrounded by smart acquaintances but with their friends far distant.The couple were living in a vacuum of their own making.The Duke discovered he’d made an enemy of his brother, the King, because of the damage he’d done to the royal institution.

He wants to show voters that the country has moved on and the Government is once more focusing on the domestic issues voters care about.But however much he tries, it will be hard to make these talks boring. They are important and there is already DRAMA BREWING.Boris saw the new Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Downing Street this week. The pair got on well in their hour-long meeting. They both want these talks to be less acrimonious than the orce negotiations both want a more cordial tone.The pair reminisced about the school they had both attended in Brussels. Unlike Eton, it didn’t have playing fields, and until Johnson arrived the only game in the playground was marbles. He introduced some more rough and tumble.No were pleased that von der Leyen, rather than the more confrontational Michel Barnier, took the lead. As one No source points out, the EU loathed the lack of clarity and authority under Theresa May: She wasn’t clear what she wanted and it wasn’t certain that she could deliver what she wanted.With Boris and his new majority it is very dferent. He was able to point von der Leyen to the Tory manesto’s commitments on the future trade deal and say this was his mandate and that he was determined to deliver it.Yet despite the pair’s attempt to maintain a friendly tone, there are already tensions. Boris is irritated that the EU keeps saying it is nigh-on impossible to negotiate a full trade deal by December , despite having signed up to a political declaration that commits it to trying to do just that.The DANGER is that the EU thinks that under time pressure Boris will bend, that he will either extend the transition period — something he has repeatedly promised not to do — or drop his commitment to breaking away from EU rules and regulations.Boris is determined not to do either of these things. He doesn’t want to extend and believes in the value of the UK having the right to do things dferently.Both sides have frequently misunderstood each other in this process. Both sides must now realise that the other means what it says. Unless they do, there is going to be an almighty bust-up and no trade deal at the end of all this.THERE will be a National Security Council meeting later this month to decide whether or not to allow the Chinese company Huawei to be involved in the construction of the UK’s G network.This is an issue of fierce debate in Whitehall. Under Theresa May, it led to the then Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson’s sacking from government.Hawkish figures inside government fear No is leaning towards allowing Huawei’s involvement. One complains that Downing Street’s timetable for the technology’s roll-out is, “not realistic”, but that this time pressure means it will need Huawei involved. However, I understand that the Americans are pushing very hard for the UK to bar Huawei.One senior US government national security figure has been in London this week to lobby directly on this point.Before he makes a decision on Huawei, Boris Johnson should consider the damage it could do to Britain’s most important security relationship – the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing agreement with Australia, Canada, the US and New Zealand.Eventhe UK thinks it can manage Huawei’s involvement,our allies do not then we shouldn’t proceed. It is simply not worth the risk of undermining such a vital alliance.Don’t expect his approach to change. His holidays will be far more glam than Cameron and May’s were.THE most common reason British governments fail is that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor fall out.If No and the Treasury – the most powerful department in government – aren’t on the same page, nothing gets done.Boris Johnson and Sajid Javid are determined to avoid this fate. In the run-up to the Budget on March , there will be a huge effort to make sure that the Treasury and No work together.One Johnson ally tells me the two men will have a Budget-focused meeting at the start of each week to make sure they are in agreement on the key issues.Then their teams will meet again mid-week to assess progress. Javid, whose job is safe in the coming reshuffle, is determined to show that the Treasury is capable of delivering on Boris Johnson’s agenda of levelling up across the country.Those close to him are confident that they can put meat on the bones of No’s plan.AT Cabinet this week it was impressed on ministers that one of the most important events this year is COP, the climate change conference the UK is hosting in Glasgow in November.The UK Government wants to use the event to show how Britain can lead on clean growth post-Brexit.I understand there will be a steady drum beat of announcements on this front throughout the year: The Tories want to show they are helping create new green-collar jobs.They also hope that by holding the event in Scotland, they can emphasise the benefits of the Union.THE Labour leadership contest has yet to catch fire.The Tories are not particularly concerned about any of the candidates.Though there is some hesitation about how they would handle PMQs with Jess Phillips, who likes to make very personal attacks on Boris Johnson.But the most interesting candidate in the race is Lisa Nandy.She seems to have the clearest understanding of why Labour lost.Her bid is starting to have faint echoes of David Cameron’s successful tilt at the Tory leadership in .GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They aren’t financially independent now — they get £.- million from the Prince Of Wales and about five per cent from the Sovereign Grant.Harry is reasonably wealthy but not necessarily in cash flow. The sums he inherited from his mother and great grandmother have been invested.Meghan has some means but to live the sort of lestyle they are used to takes a lot of money.It is conceivable Charles could cut the money he gives to Harry —he gives him any at all. Being a dad, he probably will.But there are tax implications — particularlythere are handouts.Security has also to be considered. Harry is a prince of the United Kingdom, his grandmother head of state and father heir.The atmosphere at the meeting will be, up to a point, heated. But people won’t lose their tempers.The Queen is pragmatic. She understands problems people have but Harry will be fully aware of her displeasure. To go off half-cocked as he and Meghan did is unacceptable.The question is how dare they do that. She signed up for this.

And what a waste of their chance to play a key role in helping our Royal Family prosper after the Queen is gone.And what a waste of Harry and Meghan’s unique chance to be a living, inspirational representation of the multiracial country in which we now live. How quickly the shine has come off the golden couple.Less than two years after that wedding day, Harry and Meghan are scurrying off to an ill-defined “progressive” new le in Canada.Butthey have been unhappy with their royal roles, they have brought it on themselves. This much-loved couple have always been too thin-skinned for their own good.They have always been hysterically touchy when justied criticism came their way, such as when they lectured about climate change while reclining on private jets.The criticism was nothing personal. Hollywood stars get called out for climate hypocrisy. Do Harry and Meghan really imagine we will just tug our forelocks as they fly around the world in private jets while talking like Greta Thunberg in a tiara Harry and Meghan are never satisfied with anything less than unconditional deference. They apparently loathe royal le, yet demand to be treated like royalty.They have demonstrated an epic sense of entitlement, such as asking the taxpayer to pick up the £.million builder’s bill for doing up their home, Frogmore Cottage.Their great self-pitying delusion is that the wicked British media has it in for them. But it is not the media that caused Meghan so much excruciating embarrassment.It is largely her own dysal family and their indiscreetly flapping cakeholes, especially her dear old discarded dad Thomas Markle and her loony half-sister Samantha. Harry and Meghan’s self-pity is astounding.“Never complain, never explain,” has been the motto of the modern Royal Family. It has worked rather well.But place Harry and Meghan in front of a sympathetic camera crew, such as when ITV’s Tom Bradby trailed them on their tour of South Africa, and they can’t stop whining. Even when surrounded by victims of rape and landmines, they managed to feel sorry for themselves.“Not many people askedI’m OK,” Meghan complained in the Third World. There has not been a royal couple with such a staggering lack of self-awareness since Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI of France. And look what happened to them.Harry and Meghan owe their mega-celebrity totally to their connection with the Royal Family. Their superstardom has nothing to do with Meghan’s acting career. Their lives of unimaginable luxury are funded in large part by the British taxpayer.The average couple spends just under £, on their wedding. Harry and Meghan were said to have blown £MILLION. Yet they do not appear to have a grateful bone between them. They seem incapable of counting their multiple blessings.Even now, after handing in their royal resignation, they give every indication that they want all the privileges of royal le with none of the obligations. They want to have their Eton mess and eat it.Harry and Meghan’s security alone currently costs around £, a year, paid for by the politan Police — which means paid for by the British taxpayer. Get the Mounties to start paying for it.And can we finally nail the great lie that Meghan has been persecuted in the UK because of her mixed race  When she first appeared, Meghan was a hurricane of fresh air. The British looked at her and it was love at first sight.This weary, ided, Brexit-battered nation was delighted to have an injection of Hollywood glamour. And millions of Brits now live in mixed-race families. There was real delight to see the Royal Family catching up with the rest of us.Among those crowds at Windsor on their wedding day I saw families of every race and creed under the sun who were ecstatic to see the Royal Family becoming less white, more inclusive, more representative.Harry and Meghan have drawn criticism because of their total lack of self-awareness. Both of them are independently rich. Harry is worth around £million after inheritances from his mother and the Queen Mum.Prince Charles gives him £million every year. Meghan made around £million from her role in long-runningTV legal drama Suits.Yet this fabulously wealthy couple have been happy to let others — the British taxpayer, Prince Charles, the Queen — pay their way in their gilded world.Six weeks, which is theof time that Harry and Meghan have just spent in Canada, is a very long time to be away from home.Unless, of course, “home” doesn’t feel like home because you feel criticised for everything you do and wear, your family – on both sides – are a nightmare and you are constantly judgedby people who have never met you and never will.I should imagine that in this case, Canada seems like a very good place to call home. So, who can blame Meghan and Harry for deciding to leave the UK behind to get away from it all, and maybe staying away from here in the long-term I have a lot of respect for the couple for ploughing their own furrow and walking their own path.Honestly, I couldn’t be happier for Harry, who has experienced so much sadness, that he has met a woman brave enough to suggest doing things a bit dferently.Although they are currently making bold statements about giving up the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, they show no sign of being willing to pay for their own security, or their own flunkies, or offer the taxpayer a rebate on those reported £million nuptials.There has never been even the slightest hint of gratitude. There has never been any indication that they — this rich, pampered couple with a beautul baby boy who will never want for anything — realise how lucky they are.So Harry and Meghan are not the only ones with mixed emotions today. There is real resentment that Harry and Meghan have caused distress to our Queen and it will not be easily forgotten or forgiven.The Queen has a -year-old husband who has recently been in hospital. She has a son mired in a squalid sex scandal. And she is  years old. Who the hell do Harry and Meghan think they are This feels like an abdication with a taxpayer-funded safety net. The couple plan to “step back as senior members of the Royal Family” but show no inclination to give up the privileges and pay days that come with the job.They say they want to “work to become financially independent”. But between them they are currently worth around £million. Why not pay their own way NOW Are they really suggesting that they turn their backs on this nation while asking it to foot their bills  It looks like it. The British taxpayer will continue to stump up for their phenomenal security bills. Harry’s daddy will cough up for much .So you can’t help wondering how intelligent they really are, this TV soap actress and a man who left Eton with two A-levels— a school where my dog could get four A-levels.Do Harry and Meghan really think they have had a raw deal  Are they that stupid  There is no republican movement in this country.The Queen has reigned far too well for far too long —  years on the throne next month — for anti-monarchy sentiment to develop.The Queen has spent her entire le placing public duty above private happiness.She has been the stable, stoic centre of this nation for so long that she has single-handedly made losing our monarchy unthinkable.Yet when a spokesman for anti-monarchy pressure group Republic demanded Harry and Meghan make a clean break, I found myself nodding in agreement with every withering word.“Theyhave said that they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won’t stop taking money until they find other sources of income,” said Republic’s Graham Smith.“To suggest they’re not already financially independent is incredibly crass and belies a sense of entitlement and lack of self-awareness common among royals.”This republican is right. If Harry and Meghan want a new le hanging out with the Clooneys and striking deals with Apple, they should fund it themselves.As they say in North America, do it on your own dime. Give up the HRH titles. Stop leeching off your royal status.They will be a footnote in the story of our Royal Family, Meghan the Wallis Simpson of the st Century, Harry another Duke of Windsor who believed exile with his American orcee would make him happy.The Royal Family is not all about them.The Queen will be an impossible act to follow. But the photograph of Queen Elizabeth smiling proudly with the next three generations of future kings — Princes Charles, William and George — suggests our Royal Family will last for at least  years after Netflix has cancelled The Crown, evenone day Meghan gets to play herself.The succession is assured. Decent men will wear the crown. And Kate is great. But let history record that no royal couple was ever as adored as Harry and Meghan.It is astonishing — and unbelievably sad, perhaps even tragic — that millions of us will be happy to see the back of them.Astrological patterns repeat in families through generations, just as it is doing with Meghan and Harry.Edward VIII, who wed American orcee Wallis Simpson, put love before duty, and planted a karmic seed that is at the root of what is unfolding now. It can be likened to a virus that has been lurking in the Royal household and is now being re-activated by Harry and Meghan.So what comes next  Uranus, the planet of shock-waves, moves to confront the Sun in Aquarius on January  and forms a clash with the New Moon on the th.There is likely to be a stinging backlash as all the remaining senior family members have their roles shaken up.Meghan will create a power couple that flourishes by spring with a number of initiatives. By December , another baby announcement is likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We would have done the same to protect British servicemen and women. In fact, as Britain’s Defence Secretary I did exactly that, with the full support of Prime Minister David Cameron.Let’s not forget that every country has the right to self-defence.Of course, nobody wants this crisis to escalate. Indeed Iran’s retaliation has been noticeably limited so far.But the chorus for “de-escalation” carries risks too. Iran has been attacking Western shipping, including capturing a British tanker. Iran has fired missiles at Saudi oil refineries.Iran continues to wage proxy wars in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Through its militias, Iran continues to destabilise neighbouring Iraq.At some point, somebody had to draw the line. Qasem Soleimani was no hero or statesman. He directed terrorist attacks across the Middle East.Thousands of Syrians, Iraqis and Yemenis died as a result. Iranian dissidents, too, were brutally suppressed.The roadside bomb-making he sponsored killed many of our brave servicemen in Iraq. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson reminded us, he had the blood of our soldiers on his hands.Has Trump’s strike weakened the case for Western intervention  It is worth remembering our troops and those of the US are in Iraq at Iraq’s invitation.Since , we have helped lead an international coalition of more than  countries to support its fragile democracy and liberate that country from the terrorist death-cult of Daesh Isis.And thanks to precision strikes by the RAF and the training by the British Army of thousands of Iraqi troops, Daesh has lost the pernicious grip it once had.Defeating Daesh isn’t just a matter of helping a friend in need or of standing up for human rights. Mercully, we have stopped Yazidi women from being raped, prisoners being burnt alive, gay people being thrown off buildings and Western hostages sadistically executed.But tackling Daesh terrorism is also vital to protect our own way of le here in Western Europe.Islamist fundamentalism needs to be defeated, whether in Mosul, Raqqa, a Paris suburb or on London Bridge.So yes, let’s continue to work with our allies to persuade Iran’s revolutionaries to take a dferent path.Saudi Arabia, the other Gulf countries and even Russia all have roles to play in getting Iran back to the negotiating table.After the appalling shooting down of the Ukrainian airliner, let’s try to show the Iranian people their government needs to be more truthful and more open, that there is a better future beyond the mullahs and the republican guards.But diplomacy alone will not be enough. We have to protect our national interests too. Trump’s strike is a stark reminder that in the end, we must all stand up when those interests are threatened so directly.First, we must persuade other European navies to work with the US and our own Royal Navy in patrolling and protecting convoys through the Strait of Hormuz.This is a vital choke point for Europe’s trade and energy. The gas and oil we need this winter pass through it.It is ludicrous that some Nato allies won’t work with American ships for fear of upsetting the mullahs in Tehran.This has to be a US-led international operation.Second, we need a better nuclear agreement with Iran. It was right to try to halt their nuclear programme. But the previous deal wasn’t comprehensive — it didn’t even cover missiles — and it completely failed to constrain Iranian misbehaviour in the region. If anything, Iran used the access to new finance that deal released to step up its proxy wars in Yemen and where.A new deal should ensure full oversight of all Iran’s nuclear activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and only allow Iran back into the international markets when its civil nuclear programme is in complete compliance.Third, we have to step up our campaign against terrorism.Outside the EU after Brexit, we will still need to share intelligence and work together with our European partners to identy new attacks. But our closest ally in the battle to protect our values will always be the US. We may not always agree with Trump’s tactics but we shouldn’t ignore that he has finally cut through the illusion — Iran’s current regime is not our friend.Iran will certainly have learned a lesson from President Trump’s decisive action. But I hope we will do so too.Turning a blind eye to those who foster international terrorism is no longer an option for any of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She askedthey wanted to join her in the “mile-high club”, then attacked cabin crew who refused her more alcohol.Demi Burton tried to headbutt and kick six crew members and passengers who tried to restrain her before she was arrested when the plane landed.In court, the -year-old claimed she had been drinking because she has a fear of flying and said this behaviour is out of character, which may be true.Her defence lawyer Martin Callery said: “She is thoroughly ashamed of herself . . .  and utterly embarrassed at the way she behaved.”But that is certainly not the impression she conveyed outside court, where she gleefully flicked obscene hand gestures at photographers.No doubt she stopped smiling when she heard she had been sentenced to six months in prison. Personally, I’m not sure how effective prison is. But the problem with reckless behaviour is that you have to face the consequences.And I really hope for Demi, this is the moment she gets her le back on track. We all make mistakes. It’s what we do afterwards that defines us.It would be easy to assume that Demi is a hopeless case. But she is young enough to turn her le around, to work hard, do better and see this rock-bottom moment as a catalyst for change.And then something good will come from what is a very low moment in her le. We don’t have to look far for examples of people who have overcome lapses or mistakes before going on to succeed.Take Robert Downey Jr, who went from drug addict to one of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors. Or Elton John and Robbie Williams, both of whom have overcome major drug issues before enjoying renewed stardom, fatherhood and, more importantly, a good le.While it is not the same as a drunken mistake, anyone who has made it in business will have a good few failures under their belt — whether it is a dodgy commercial decision, plain bad luck or a company that has gone bust.It is not what happens to us in le but what we do next that counts. So I am guessing that, from her cell, Demi might be reflecting on what she might do dferently when she gets out. Andshe isn’t, she should be.Because it is the getting back on the horse that counts, evenit means resisting the urge to go back to bed to hide. No one is perfect. No one gets through le without messing up or things going wrong.Before success, you will get temporary defeat or total failure. The key to getting through it is resilience. And one of the best gts you can give a child is to encourage them not to give up.By the way, I speak here from experience. Like any businesswoman, I’ve made some mistakes and had my fair share of knocks.There are some that I have managed to turn to my advantage and others that I have had to chalk up to experience.The key thing is that I have learned from what went wrong, then moved on. That experience has allowed me to create a mini-manesto on how to fail how to respond to setbacks and failure, which I’ll share here now:Give yourself time to recover and reflect. Force yourself to take small steps to get back on the horse. Do not accept failure. See it as a step on the journey towards success.Remember that challenging and dficult moments are what help you grow bigger or better. Without them, you would stay the same.The only people who haven’t experienced setbacks are people who are too scared to try. So “failure” is often a sign of bravery. Hold your head up high at all times.Try your best and be proud to do so, eventhings don’t always work out the way you want them to. Remind yourself: “Where there is a will, there’s a way.” And as they say, the best thing about the future is it comes one day at a time.ANOTHER new year, another month of looking at photos of scantily clad people on beaches in sunnier climes and asking myselfI am the only person who is not on the beach.This is the time of year for massive bikini-body and holiday FOMO.But let us all take heart that it is also, oh joy, the time of year for elasticated waists hidden under chunky knitwear.Personally, I am more than happy to swap the beach for nothing to shave and no stomach to suck in. Bliss.I’M sure parents everywhere were shocked to read the story of the son who bullied his mother and stepfather so viciously he has been jailed for three years for his controlling and coercive behaviour.When Nicholas Hazell, , of County Durham, went back to live with Judith Ridley, , and her reverend husband Stephen, , after losing his job, he made their lives hell.Hazell, above, created a “horrendous atmosphere” at the family home and flew into a petulant ragehe didn’t get his own way, Durham Crown Court heard.Among his worst outbursts were when Hazell threw his mother into a chair and spat at her while holding a screwdriver to his stepfather’s throat. He also told them: “I am a master of bullying.”It sounds horric.I feel so sorry for his mum, who must be devastated that her little boy turned into a cruel bully as an adult.I dont do needles when it comes to my face.  Lasers, facials, peels . . .  sure. But needles are another story entirely.If you are willing to take the chance of injecting poison into your face, at the very least you want a predictable result. And in my experience, you don’t get it.Who wants eyebrows at the top of their head, lips that come into the room before you do, or a forehead that doesn’t move  Not me, that’s for sure. However . . .This week I read that not only is the gorgeous Abbey Clancy having micro-Botox injections, hyaluronic acid fillers and vitamins, she is doing it with TWENTY needles at once.Abbey, , is having something called an aquagold facial, so called because each needle is covered in -carat gold. The marketing blurb claims this treatment will reduce pores, blur out fine lines and leave your skin with a vibrant glow.Some might say this is a slippery slope to the stronger stuff but Abbey looks amazing.  So it has to be worth a try, don’t you think I HAD to laugh at the photos of the BBC newsreader whose dress, which had burst open minutes before going on air, was cobbled together from behind by quick-thinking colleagues.  Liz Beacon’s outfit was patched up with gaffer tape and bulldog clips.I used to believe what I saw on TV. But since filming The Apprentice, I know all too well that all is not necessarily what it seems.Two examples spring to mind. First, the countless times I have been filmed in the boardroom with a smart jacket on top and leggings or even pyjama bottoms and slippers under the boardroom table.Second, and worse, the time I somehow forgot to bring a bra on a day I was wearing a white blouse.Luckily, a kind crew member who is roughly the same size as me lent me hers.  And the show, as it always seems to do, went on.I WAS appalled to read about the private Islamic secondary school that has been “unlawfully segregating” boys and girls for all activities except weekly assemblies, according to a stinging Ofsted report.One of the teachers theretold pupils “university is not for females”, according to the report. Which begs the question of where, then, is the best place for females  The kitchen Inspectors who visited Birmingham’s Redstone Educational Academy in November last year also found male students were given privileges and treated more favourably than their female counterparts when it came to sports, school trips and work experience.That was something disputed by the headteacher.That’s not good enough. There can be no place for a school like this and it should be closed down.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hymen repair surgery to get your virginity back!”Another clinic, the Gynae Centre, in central London, recommends having the “small” operation because “the hymen is considered a token of virginity and for cultural and religious reasons can be an important factor in a new marriage. In many cases marriages are even annulledthe hymen is torn.”The Sun has approach Regency International and Gynae Centre for comment but are yet to receive a response.“Virginity repair” surgery is legal in the UK.Most hymenoplasty procedures are carried out privately in clinics that are not required to collate statistics, making it impossible to know how many take place.However charities believe hundreds of patients are undergoing the procedure in the UK every year.The Sunday Times reported some clinics have seen soaring demand, with one reporting a fourfold increase in inquiries in the past five years.About , people searched Google for hymenoplasty and related terms in the UK last year.Outraged campaigners have accused the clinics of capitalising on the fears of patients.Guidance from the General Medical Councilsays that before undertaking any procedure practitioners must obtain a patient’s “informed consent”, which “may not be validit is given under pressure or duress exerted by another person”.Dr Leila Frodsham, from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said hymen repair perpetuated “harmful myths” about virginity.Dr Frodsham said: “I think people would be surprised to know this is going on.”“There are a lot of people making a lot of money out of very vulnerable women.”She also said that requests for the operation posed an “ethical dilemma” to medics.Dr Frodsham added: “It is very dficult to think that it’s justied to operate on somebody as part of a religious practice.”“There is no benefit other than demonstrating that you’re a virgin on your wedding night.”Mohammad Masood, director of MAS Gynaecology, said requests for the procedure at his Harley Street clinic had risen four-fold since .He said his patients typically found him online and were “almost exclusively Muslim”.He explained: “Some of the girls are going through situations wherethey don’t bleed there is stigma and there’s no way the marriage will survive.”“Their wellbeing hinges on their virginity and not bringing a bad name to the family.”In every case, Mr Masood said he arranged a discreet consultation with the patient to determine their suitability for the procedure.He also offered follow-up counselling, but “usually they do not want contact.

She simply would not wander off like this.The theory was not only insulting it was, much more importantly, frighteningly damaging to the chances of finding Madeleine quickly.Operation Grange, a Scotland Yard probe into the case which began in , has previously said they believe Maddie was snatched or taken during a burglary gone wrong.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A recent Postmedia poll in Canada found that over % there were in favour of Prince Harry becoming the Governor General of Canada.The poll also showed that it was younger Canadians who would be most in favour of such a move, and that even in the generally French republican province of Quebec, almost half would also support this.The current Governor General, Julie Payette, who has been in post since , has done a sterling job. However, neither she, nor anyone  who has previously held this position, possess the same kind of box office appeal that Harry does.While their methods and approach to royal duties may not always fall in line with tradition, there is no doubting that Harry and Meghan are seen by many of the younger generation as symbols of a new, modern, vibrant monarchy.Installing Harry as Governor General would not only bolster support for the Monarchy internationally, but also provide Canada, and by extension the United Kingdom, an enormous boost in soft power at an important juncture for our country as we depart the European Union.Procedurally, there would be few barriers to making this a reality. The Governor General is appointed to the role on the advice of Canadian Prime Minister, and while the convention is for the Governor General to serve for around five years, there are no specic constitutional requirements for this.Thus,this is something Harry himself wished to do, a call from Her Majesty to Justin Trudeau would go a long way in pushing this along.I have the honour to remain, Madam, Your Majesty’s most humble and obedient servant.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps this explains why his Wikipedia entry has just been doctored to delete his status as a “millionaire”. Not me, guv, protests Starmer.He is also weirdly reluctant to declare where he stands on the political spectrum. Is he a Corbynite or a Blairite or a bit of both  “I don’t have the names of former leaders tattooed on my head,” snfs the man named at birth after the first leader of the Labour Party.This knight of the realm, who played violin at fee-paying Reigate Grammar School alongside Fatboy Slim, claims a humble background as the son of a toolmaker.“I know what it’s like,” he insists, asraised in a cardboard box.Well, I went to the same school when it was a “bog-standard” state grammar. My father was a journeyman upholsterer. It didn’t give me any special insights.Starmer boasts in his new campaign video about picket-line stints alongside down- trodden Wapping printworkers — against my boss, Rupert Murdoch, a hate figure on the Left.This chameleon politician was dubbed a “Sir” on the recommendation of Gordon Brown, a title he discourteously declines to use because it invites contempt among those with a vote.His citation was for “services to law and criminal justice”, after a five-year term as DPP.At about the same time he was parachuted into Parliament as MP for rock-solid Labour Holborn and St Pancras, in London.It is here that self-respecting Labour voters should pause and reflect.Many believe these political plums were reward for the longest, costliest and perhaps most spiteful criminal persecution in history — ordered by Sir Keir Starmer.His new leadership video slyly refers to this time, apparently to boost his scourge-of-capitalism image among the “comrades” — even though politics should play no part in a DPP’s decision-making. In a travesty of justice, he rammed two dozen innocent journalists through Old Bailey trials on trumped-up conspiracy charges — a medieval catch-all which even the Crown Prosecution Service admitted was “an extremely dficult and rarely visited area of the law”.The prosecuting counsel was given a flea in his ear for “chopping and changing”, the charges against the journalists.The trials ended with acquittals all round, an admission that “no crime may have been committed” and this rebuke from the Lord Chief Justice:“What concerns me is the freedom of the Press and the desire of officials to contain information.“We must ensure the Press is protected — we can’t use criminal sanctions to undermine their position.”The defendants were all journalists on The Sun or the News of the World — then seen by the Left as fair game.The trials followed The Sun’s decision to switch its support from Gordon Brown’s floundering regime to David Cameron’s Tories.Some believe the two were linked — but surely that’s just a conspiracy theory.What is absolutely clear to those who care about the issue is Starmer’s readiness to use his power to curb Press freedom.As citizens of totalitarian regimes rapidly learn to their cost, without a free Press there is no such thing as free speech.IT’S win-win for the Sussexes and losses all round for the House of Windsor.Meghan’s first kiss-and-tell will be a bestseller, with all the gossip on Randy Andy and those secret royal scandals.Harry’s right-on charities will be milked for millions.Once our revered Queen has departed, the monarchy will dwindle to a sideshow on the US celebrity circuit.Charles is too old to compete and William is too dull, despite Kate’s best efforts.Hero Harry will emerge as victor in this grotesque civil war.

And he vowed: “What I would do is lead from the top and say it’s my responsibility to deal with it. I wouldn’t say it’s for ­somebody . I want the files. I want the numbers on my desk.”  Labour’s General Election campaign was derailed when Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said Mr Corbyn was unfit for high office because of anti-Semitism and that a victory for Labour would put the “very soul of our nation” at stake.In its statement today, the Board of Deputies of British Jews calls on all ­contenders to sign up to its ten-point plan. It includes settling all outstanding anti-Semitism cases by a fixed deadline. Mr Corbyn’s aides have been ­accused of interfering in cases against members facing claims of anti-Semitism.  The Deputies say the new leader must ensure the ­internal disciplinary process is “independent”. They also call for awareness ­programmes. Prosecutors are considering charges against five people in the party over anti-Semitism. The issue re-emerged ahead of the close of nominations for the leader and deputy leader tomorrow.

Abena Oppong-Asare and Florence Eshalomi both won their seats in December and have spoken out about attitudes in Parliament. Oppong-Asare, who is MP for Erith and Thamesmead, says she was also handed a bag by a Tory MP to look after because he thought she was someone .  She was also confused with other black women in the Commons. In a Twitter thread she explained: The other day I was outside the @HouseofCommons chamber talking to @DrRosena [Rosena Allin-Khan] and one of the Tory MPs walked straight to me to put his bag in my hands asking me to look after it #ThisIsWhyRepresentationMattersShe said: In my first week someone came up to me confusing me with another black MP. I said no I’m the other black sista from Erith and Thamesmead Labour . He raised he eyebrows and said wow there more of you. Adding: Last week another MP from another party came over to chat to me about a convo we had before Xmas. I realised a few mins in she got me confused with another #BlackSistaShe concluded: Iaposm thinking I might need to write my name on my forehead as I think some people are really struggling to tell the dference. Once Ms Oppong-Asare started posting her experiences fellow newbie Florence Eshalomi joined in the discussion. She tweeted: Girl I also got confused for another black sista MP as we were coming out of the voting lobby...... but I have to admit it was by a fellow Labour MP. Guess we all need to wear massive name tags right.  Their tweets prompted an outpouring of support. Leadership candidate Jess Phillips remarked: Abena you are already making your mark in Parliament as a brilliant force. This experience speaks to so much that is wrong with our parliament and our institutions. You should find the Tory who did it next week and ask them to hold your bag and throw your coat in too! But Rayner faced a backlash for her response to Florence Eshalomi. She commented: “Me and Jess Phillips often have the same problem because we both have an accent despite them being totally dferent.” Some users accused her of comparing their experiences with her experience of being mistaken for other MPs with a strong regional accent. She later deleted the message, saying her remark y had been poorly judged, adding: “As I would in no way compare that to my colleagues who are mistaken due to the colour of their skin.”  It comes as both Clive Lewis and Dawn Butler, who do not yet have the numbers they need to get on the leadership and deputy leadership ballots, have suggested that the Parliamentary Labour Party has an issue with racism. Butler, who has been an MP since  has previously spoken of being mistaken for a cleaner in parliament.

Our every waking moment now needs to be focused on making sure that we win next time. There are no quick fixes. But the first decision we must get right is choosing Labour’s new leadership. When I joined the Labour Party back in the mid-s, I admired how John Prescott used the Deputy Leadership as a campaigning role. I am standing for that same position.  If elected, I’ll be a campaigning Deputy Leader. There will be important parliamentary battles ahead to try to limit the damage of Boris Johnson’s push for Thatcherism .. But as Deputy Leader I mainly want to be out across the country building a Labour Party rooted in every community. We need to show those communities, whose trust we’ve lost, that we’re on their side. We do that by standing side by side with our communities in whatever local battles they face. Be that with the parents forced to fund raise for basic school supplies, women fighting the closure of domestic violence shelters or young fast-food workers demanding fair pay.  Any road back to power for Labour also means reconnecting with those Leave-supporting areas where we lost over  seats. I represent a strongly Leave seat. As Deputy Leader, I will use that experience to chair a Special Commission into how we rebuild in those areas. When it comes to policies, we need to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Our last two manestos offer real solutions to the problems our communities face. I don’t believe for a minute that we lost because we offered a £ per hour living wage, promised to build , council houses per year or to scrap tuition fees.  Policies like our Green Industrial Revolution can be part of how we reconnect, especially in areas hit first by Thatcherite deindustrialisation and then by a decade of Tory austerity.  But let’s be honest. Good policies aren’t enoughthey are not being listened to. As Deputy Leader I would overhaul our messaging so it focused around  key popular policies. Our policies must both offer hope of a better country and be easily explainable on the doorstep.

Sir Desmond Swayne said families on benefits who are forced to turn to foodbanks should learn to do food shopping “more cost effectively”. Writing in a local newspaper he argued foodbanks are an “important contribution” to the welfare system. But checks should be made to see how families “actually spend” their benefits, the MP for New Forest West, in Hampshire added. The former aide to ex-PM David Cameron said: “The shocking statistic is one in five of our children is obese by the time they leave primary school and this disproportionately affects those children in the lowest household incomes. To put it bluntly : the poorest are amongst the fattest. “The conclusion I draw is their families need, in addition to welfare payments, help with how to shop more cost effectively and healthily.” "},{"url":null,"title":"asda shuts meat fish counters","story":"NewsAsda shuts meat and fish counters and replaces them with ready-to-eat foodThe supermarket confirmed there would be no job losses or a reduction in hours for staff - the new counters will start in  stores before being rolled out across  by the end of the yearShareCommentsByDamon WilkinsonHelen Johnson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe meat and fish counters will be replaced with food for now counters \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailTwo backpackers were left clinging to le after their car lost control and flipped onto its roof in a remote spot in the middle of the Australian outback. Best friends Robyn Jago, , and Elyse O’Donnell, from Merseyside, have described their terrying experience while on a dream trip. Their adventure took a devastating turn when a tyre on the car they were travelling in burst, causing it to lose control and veer off in the wrong direction, the Liverpool Echo reports. Elyse, who was driving the car at the time, tried to regain control but it soon hit a dip at the side of the road causing it to flip onto its roof and hit a nearby tree, which smashed straight through the windscreen. They escaped the car with severe injuries, including broken backs, and the emergency services were four hours away. Robyn from Halewood, and Elyse, from Stockbridge Village, travelled over to Perth together from Thailand, back in February . After securing jobs on a farm, the pair spent the following year working “in the middle of nowhere” in Broome and Hallscreek, in order to save up enough money to travel up the East coast. But on September , their trip took a devastating turn. Robyn said she first realised that something was wrong, when she smelt “burning rubber” coming from the tyres - but it was already too late. Ironically, Australian police told Robynshe had not had removed her seat-belt she would have been impaled by the tree.  Robyn told the Echo: “I woke up and I was on my hands and knees scrunched up in a ball. I donapost remember being in the air flipping. I just remember seeing a tiny glimpse out of the window which I knew wasnapost the road. I was trying to understand what had happened when I saw a light switch on the floor next to me and thataposs when I realised that it was actually the roof of the car and that we were upside down. Robyn and Elyse were in the car with two other women, who they had met the month before, but who have asked not to be named.  Seconds before the accident, Robyn had unfastened her seat belt in order to change position in the tightly packed car, meaning she took the full force of the crash. Robyn said: Your senses slowly start coming back to you and I heard screaming and Elyseaposs voice. “She had managed to get out of the car by this point withand they were stood on the side of the road. When I looked to my right I sawcovered in blood, I thought she was dead. She had blood all over her face and wounds where the tree had scraped her. I screamed.” Robyn said: “Elyse could hear a hissing noise coming from the car so she thought it was going to blow. “She was shouting ‘you need to get out of the car.”  By this point, Robyn said she knew she had broken her back but they had no other option but to get out of the car. She said: “I couldn’t get out of the side I was on so we had to get out of the other side but there was a branch coming through the window. “Elyse andhad to pull us both out in the end.” Robyn suffered from a bleed on the brain during the crash and was left with a broken back and a burst finger. Elyse broke her back and neck in five dferent places.  One of the other two women who was travelling in the car at the time of the crash sustained a total of  serious injuries including a wound to the head, while the other was left with black eye and a torn ligament to the shoulder. Robyn said: “I never take my seatbelt off, I literally just took it off for a minute to get comfortable. “But the police told me afterwards thatI had had my seat belt on there was a good chance I would have been impaled by the tree and would probably have been dead by now.” After managing to escape from the vehicle, the girls stood “shaking” as they tried to work out what to do next. Robyn said the crash took place literally in the middle of nowhere” and was a three and a half hour drive away from the nearest hospital. However, thanks to a lorry driver who was driving past shortly after the accident, the girls managed to get to the roadside to call for help. Robyn said: “We were far away from the road because of where the car landed butheard a lorry going past so she bombed it up to the side of the road.  She told him aposweaposve just been in a car crash’ and he grabbed his first aid kit, he was lovely.” There was a mining site not too far away so he called there and said ‘have you got first aiders to help in any way they can. Robyn said it took a total of four hours for an ambulance and police to arrive at the scene of the crash. The girls were then taken to the nearest clinic,  minutes away, to be assessed before Robyn was taken with one of the other women, by air ambulance to Broome Hospital. While Elyse and her other friend who was involved in the crash, were taken to Kunnuara Hospital the following day. Robyn said: “The first person Elyse told was her mum. She panicked at first because all Elyse did was cry down the phone but then once she told her everyone’s alive and she went really calm and calmed Elyse right down. “Elyse told my sister for me because I lost my phone in the crash. It was so surreal it honestly still doesn’t feel like it happened to us.”  Robyn spent the following eight days after the accident being treated in hospital before she was discharged over the course of a week, while Elyse spent the following nine days in hospital. Due to the severity of both of their injuries, they were fitted with neck braces and had to attend hospital appointments several times a week for the following three months. Robyn said: We were both in absolute agony. After we were discharged from hospital we spent the next three months mostly indoors at our friendaposs house. I had to go back to the hospital for constant checks. I was put on medication for my brain haemorrhage and memory games and brain training. We could walk but we spent a lot of time lying down because of the pain. We were tired all the time, we just had no energy. Since the accident, Robyn and Elyse have made a good progress with their injuries and had their back braces removed in December. Despite being able to walk now unsupported, Robyn said they are both unable toto work until at least March and suffer from a lot of pain which makes it a nightmare to sleep at night. Robyn said the psychological pain of the accident, has also been unbearable with both Elyse and herself regularly suffering from flash backs and night terrors. But due to the high cost of receiving physiotherapy for their injuries and counselling, the girls have been unable to get the help they desperately need. Robyn said: Itaposs taken a toll on our mental health. Iaposve had depression and anxiety before but itaposs been a whole new level since the accident. Weaposve had to sit indoors for three months watching our savings disappear while we recover. Weaposve both struggled to sleep since. We have sleep paralysis and suffer from nightly flashbacks.

Last September, just two days into the new school year , Rudi Barnes was permanently excluded from St Malachyaposs RC Primary in Miles Platting, Manchester. Headteacher Mrs Janine Parker took the decision after an incident in which he kicked and punched teaching staff, tipped over chairs and a table, and pulled displays off a wall. It was the culmination of a pattern of violent behaviour that began in nursery when he was just three. He hasnapost had another day in school since his exclusion, the Manchester Evening News reports. The week before Christmas, little Rudi was writing out cards for all his classmates. His parents Claire Scae and Carl Barnes had to take them in to school for him, but they fear Rudi is already being left behind. He went to a friendaposs birthday party and this kid said aposnobody remembers you in school apos, said Claire, . He got really upset, itaposs heartbreaking. While the parents understand why the school made the drastic decision, they are distraught and believe more should have been done to keep him in school and get him the help he clearly needs. The couple say they have no idea where Rudiaposs behaviour comes from and that it doesnapost happen at home.  Certainly, Rudiaposs exclusion is unusual. There were just  children permanently excluded aged five across the country in -, according to the Department for Education. In Manchester, only thirteen pupils in total were permanently excluded from state-funded primary schools. The advice to headteachers is that it should be an absolute last resort. However,  as the M.E.N has reported previously  , soaring rates of exclusions has been a serious problem in Manchester schools in recent years. A government review, led by former childrenaposs minister Edward Timpson and published last year, pointed to an array of negative outcomes for children who are excluded including a reduced likelihood of achieving good GCSEs, a higher chance of ending up unemployed and a higher chance of being either the victim, or perpetrator of a crime. In November , Manchester Council responded by launching a new aposInclusion Strategyapos that was designed to tackle exclusion rates. But the sad story of how Rudi Barnes came to be kicked out of school at such a young age, and his parentsapos ongoing battle to make sure he gets an education, highlights how this continues to be a challenging problem.Many of those tasked with preventing exclusions, from school staff to mental health services, are struggling with a rapidly increasing workload and dwindling budgets after a decade of government funding cuts. Four months after his permanent exclusion, Rudi still hasnapost had another day at school or been assessed by a mental health professional, despite being referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Servicesat least nine times, the M.E.N understands. By law, the local authority must make arrangements for a childaposs full time education from the sixth day of exclusion onwards. Rudi has been offered alternative provision at Bridgelea, a Pupil Referral Unit , for permanently excluded children but it has left the parents in a quandry. There used to be a Bridgelea site in Gorton, near to their home in Miles Platting, but that closed in . The main PRU site is in Withington, almost six miles away and several bus journeys away for Claire and Carl who do not have a car and are reliant on state benefits. Carl, , is a full-time carer to partner Claire who has diabetes, and is also responsible for getting Rudiaposs nine-year-old brother and two-year-old sister to school every day. The family borrowed a car to take Rudi for a day visit to Bridgelea and after meeting the headteacher, they believe the school can provide the support he needs. But the couple feel it is simply aposimpossibleapos for Carl to get the other children to school and also take Rudi to Bridgelea.  Carl and Claire were hoping Rudi could get funding from the council for transport from home to school but so far none has materialised. Manchester Council says Rudi has been provided with a bus pass for free travel and ultimately, there is no excuse for him not to be at Bridgelea. The authority has now threatened to prosecute Carl and Claire for failing to send their child to school, although it has agreed to pause proceedings after the M.E.N requested a comment about the case. If convicted, the couple face a fine or even a prison sentence. They said they will take me to court, said Carl. Fine,thataposs what it takes to explain it all, we will go to court. It seems extreme that Rudiaposs future should now be decided in a criminal court room. Carl and Claire struggle to understand how it got to this point. Speaking at the familyaposs neatly-kept home last week, the couple showed the M.E.N a pile of paper documents relating to Rudiaposs problems at school. It has already been a long and intimidating process. Rudiaposs violent behaviour began just months after he first started in nursery at St Malachyaposs in September . As might be expected of such a young child, many of the incidents were petulant in nature. They offered him a pear, and he doesnapost like pears, said Carl. So he threw it at the teacher and cut her lip. He was excluded from reception for that. Staff tried to handle Rudiaposs outbursts by taking him out of the room, but by reception, his behaviour was escalating. They said he was just getting more angry, said Carl They did get a psychologist in, a behaviour specialist. But they only came one day and didnapost see anything. The teacher told us theyaposre trained in holding techniques but they donapost like using it. If theyaposd have held him until he calmed down, then he gives hugs and kisses out to the teachers. If theyaposd held him, he wouldnapost have got excluded, or he would have got the help earlier on.  In response to Claire and Carlaposs claims, a spokesperson for the Diocese of Salford, the organisation that runs St Malchyaposs said: It would not be appropriate to comment on the inidual circumstances of any one pupil . At St Malachyaposs all decisions are taken in the best interest of our school community. However, it is understood the schoolaposs position is that only aposselectedapos, more senior staff are trained in holding techniques and that other de-escalation techniques were used with Rudi following advice from an external behaviour consultant. Often, Rudi doesnapost appear to even remember what has happened after a violent episode at school and will be hugging the same teachers he was hitting only minutes earlier. Claire and Carl describe their son as a aposlovingapos little boy who likes giving out hugs so much he even embraces the staff at his local ASDA.  Rudi has both younger and older siblings and doesnapost seem to suffer the same rage blackouts with them or his parents.  I said to one of the teachers aposis it really that bad apos said Claire.   So she showed me a video of it on the iPad and I couldnapost believe it. I thought aposis that really Rudi apos thataposs not my son. He was in a rage, his face looked dferent and everything I thought aposoh my godapos. I was heartbroken.   Itaposs like he sees red and doesnapost know what heaposs doing, but I donapost know what triggers it off.   This is what we want to find out - weaposve been begging for help. Over the past eighteen months, Rudiaposs parents, his GP and staff at St Malachyaposs have all referred him to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Serviceson several occasions. But CAMHS repeatedly refused to see Rudi on the basis he did not aposfit the criteriaapos. Carl and Claire say they were told in person they would have to wait until he was six before he would be seen. That appears to be true as CAMHS offered an appointment three days after Rudi turned six in December. But while they are happy to finally see a step forward, Carl and Claire fear it will still be a y process before Rudi gets the help he needs. And they believeRudi had been seen earlier, he might not have ended up being permanently excluded in the first place.  Heaposs heartbroken he canapost go to school, but itaposs just aposhard luck, nobodyaposs going to even look at you yetapos, said Claire. We shouldnapost be in this predicament, it should all be in place before the child is permanently excluded. He should have been sent to the PRU while he was at school. Weaposve looked into finding him another one nearer us but there isnapost one. I went in [to CAMHS] crying saying aposplease help me, what have I got to do apos, they said heaposs got to be six. Meanwhile, with Rudi now having been out of school for more than four months, the effects are starting to show. His preference is to be at St Malachyaposs and his absence is made all the more painful as he often accompanies his dad when dropping off and picking up his older brother. Mum Claire says Rudi now often refuses to eat or hides food around the house at meal times. The teacher hugged him the other day and said aposRudi youaposve lost weightapos, said Claire. Itaposs shocking. At dinner, he was crying, aposIaposm not eating it, Iaposm not eating itapos. He goes to pick his brother up and heaposs crying saying aposwhy canapost I go to school apos Heaposs only a baby - he doesnapost know whataposs happened. He says aposIaposm missing my friendsapos. Heaposs missing out on a lot. Claire and Carl are aware that some people might write them off as bad parents because of Rudiaposs predicament. But they say they couldnapost be trying any harder to do whataposs best for him and get him back in school. We just feel like weaposre hitting our heads off a wall, said Claire. The doctor said, aposyouaposve hit a brick wall, thereaposs no help out there for that age groupapos.  Imagine we were those parents who donapost caretheir kids go to school  Our kids donapost get a day off. We make sure they get up in the morning, theyaposre not even late.  It seems like itaposs all down to money though, nobody wants to help you, you get told aposphone this person, phone that personapos, weaposve phoned that many people weaposre going round in circles. Manchester Council funds aposhome to schoolapos transport services via the Travel Co-Ordination Unit. It is a complicated process that usually involves a child already having a statement of Special Educational Needsor Education, Health and Careplan. Rudi has neither because he has yet to be assessed by a professional. But evenhe does get an SEN statement, his parents may struggle to get travel support getting him to school. In its - budget, the council said there are aposexisting budget pressuresapos totalling £.million aposrelating to Special Education Needs and Disabilityhome to school transport, leaving care accommodation and adoption allowances. As a result, the council intends to save £, from its Travel Co-Ordination budget between -. However, the M.E.N understands efforts are now being made to try and resolve the situation with Rudiaposs travel arrangements. He is also due to have his first appointment with the CAMHS service in the next few days. But Claire and Carl still have a long way to go with getting Rudi back in full-time education and receiving the help he needs. There must be other kids going through this, said Carl. I think it should be highlighted that no matter what age you are,you need help, you need help. Not just my kids, all the other kids out there. In  , there were  permanent exclusions from Manchester schools, a decrease of  compared with the year before. This included  in secondary school and  in primary. But the details of Rudiaposs case suggests there is still work to do.

The young women - many of which are Muslim - are undergoing aposvirginity repairapos operations to aposensureapos they are apospureapos for their wedding night. Some private clinics charge up to £, for the invasive procedure - called hymenoplasty - and are luring patients with with advertisements that promise the surgery can aposrestore your innocenceapos and are apos per cent safeapos.An investigation by the Sunday Times found there to be at least  clinics offering the service privately, mostly in London.Campaigners have accused the clinics of capitalising on the fears of patients, the majority of which are young Muslim women from Middle Eastern and Asian families under pressure to be aposuntouchedapos when they marry. Extramarital sex, or zina, is forbidden by the Koran. Critics have slammed doctors for reinforcing the the belief that the hymen is a apossealapos that breaks during sex - when in fact only half of women bleed when they lose their virginity. One London schoolgirl saved up £, to have the surgery a few days before her th birthday after finding out she was being forced to marry a much older man. She said: I had a secret boyfriend and we were happy, but I knew my parnts would never let me marry him. She got the surgery over fears her brother would attack her aposfor bringing shame on the familyaposher mother-in-law did not see blood on the sheets following the wedding night as expected. She used her birthday money to cover the procedures at a London clinic, saying it was painful and left her with a nasty infection. She said three months later when she bled on her wedding night she was relieved she didnapost bring shame on her family, adding: My family were happy and so were his. One clinic, Regency International, which comes top of Google searches for the procedures, claims on its website that a hymenoplasty is often being performed for psychological healing.The clinic claimsa woman has suffered rape or sexual abuse, it is very likely that her Hymen will have been torn. The procedure may not only offer the physical restoration she seeks but may also supply some psychological comfort and healing as well. It also states that in some cultures, having an intact Hymen signies purity and they are offering a second chance with the procedure for women has have lost their virginity when underage or as a result of rape or assault. Charities believe hundreds of patients are undergoing the procedure in the UK every year. But as most hymen repair operations take place in private clinics which are not required to collate statistics making it is impossible to know how many are taking place. The operation, also known as hymen repair, involves constructing a layer of skin at the entrance to the vagina that can tear when a woman first has sexual intercourse. It takes less than an hour and is performed under local anaesthetic.  Mohammad Masood, director of MAS Gynaecology, said requests for the procedure at his Harley Street clinic had risen four-fold since . He said his patients typically found him online and were almost exclusively Muslim but other patients were from the Roma community. He said about a third of his patients travel to the UK, mainly from Iran and Turkey, where the proecdure is available but considered a taboo. He denies claims that surgeons are cashing in on womenaposs fears and instead says he feels he has saved lives, adding: It is a very sad situation. Halaleh Taheri, founder of the Middle Eastern Women and Society Organisation, based in Finsbury Park, north London, said she had dealt with several cases of young women who had grown up in the UK and were sexually active but then forced into marriage.

Ryan Rodgers, , and Jenny Grimes, , both unemployed, raised the money on Go Fund Me last month after saying their benefits had been capped. However, Jennyaposs own mother warned the public not to donate to the couple, from Bootle in Liverpool, saying the money will be spent on drink and drugs. Mail Online reported that Jenny split up with her partner because she was unhappy with the fundraising, and has since donated money to charity. Her sister Joanne Grimes confirmed the split. Jennyaposs mother Shelley Grattan urged people not to donate to the pair and said she was ashamed of her daughter and urged her to get away from Ryan. This is fraud and I canapost believe they have stooped so low as to use the kids in this way, she said. I am totally disgusted.

Retired school attendance officer Joan Bennett lived next door but one from the pair with her husband, Frank, and said: aposI canapost think of anyone more unsuitable to be asking for money. Another neighbour said: The worst thing was the smell. For more than two years it was like living next to a sewage plant. He was smoking pot all day long – starting at seven in the morning sometimes and carrying on until late at night.  He was an absolute disgrace.

They put “blood, sweat and tears” into the two-bed dump, bought under a council regeneration scheme. Debbie and Ste were shaken when they first stepped through the door – armed with a £, schedule of works from Liverpool City Council to bring it up to scratch. The th century terraced house had been hit by fire and had crumbling walls, broken bricks and burnt joists. But the couple worked -, did most of the renovations themselves and in  months transformed it into a cosy home for just £,. After enjoying their first Christmas in the double-fronted home in the city’s Wavertree district, the pair have been buoyed by a valuation of £,. Debbie, , says: “We never want to move because we have put so much of ourselves into this house. People thought we were nuts. “We’ve crawled on the floors, we built the floors… it’s a gamble we took and we love it. Our blood and guts have gone into it. If they’d give us next door, we’d do it again!” Recalling the first time she saw the property, Debbie says: “It was just a shell. All the joists were burnt. It was terrible. “Honestly, it was just stacks and stacks of bricks. There was nothing. My family were saying to me, ‘You’re mad’.”  Every floor had to be replaced, chimneys were removed, the sinking kitchen was underpinned, all fittings were ripped out and the windows were upgraded. Debbie and Ste, , used their savings and took a small loan to complete the work – and it was hard graft. We were there until midnight with torches. We went seven days a week, we didn’t miss a day,” Debbie says. She scoured local ads for bargains and bagged a £, kitchen for a tenth of the price and a £, bathroom suite for £,. They also picked up a slightly damaged £, front door for £.  And, slowly but surely, the place came together. Now it is a shining example of how Liverpool is breathing new le into former slums. The council unveiled its Homes For A Pound scheme in . A year later, bosses vowed that , empty houses would be brought back into use. Since then, , homes have been reoccupied – including  in the Webster Triangle, Wavertree, where the Hodges live. Seven more families are due to move in soon. A similar scheme has since been launched in Stoke-on-Trent. Last year, a Channel  documentary about the renovations in Liverpool featured Debbie and Ste.  The couple say the sense of community in the Webster Triangle is a great example of how councils candepressed areas to homely neighbourhoods. The Hodges used to rent in Anfield and had struggled to get a mortgage. Debbie suffered a serious long-term illness and Ste’s wages as a carpet cleaner were not enough to secure a home loan. Debbie says: “The council scheme was the best thing to happen to us. It brings communities together. When we moved in, there were only about three houses in the road occupied. But it’s moving on now, it’s coming to be more of a community and about half the street is filled.  “We’ve met all the neighbours and introduced ourselves. People come from everywhere, dferent areas, dferent countries. It’s a lovely community and I’m really settled here. I just love it. Once a month we clean the street and make it nice. The area is coming up, there are bars and restaurants opening further down the road… I just wouldn’t move. “I can definitely see the area getting better and we’ve never been so happy.” The couple have two daughters – Jade, , a psychologist who has her own home, and -year-old teaching assistant Jenna, who still lives with her parents and is studying for an MSC. Debbie hopes the Homes For A Pound scheme will help young Liverpudlians like Jenna get on the property ladder.

The Duchess of Sussex ed to the £ million waterside Vancouver Island mansion where she spent Christmas with Prince Harry but managed to avoid TV crews when she flew in using the low-cost WestJet airline. The media, who assumed she would be on a private jet, missed her arrival, Mail Online has reported. Over Christmas, local residents were asked by royal protection offers to hold back from revealing their location for at least a couple of weeks to allow the royal couple some time to themselves.  The couple reportedly went hiking and jogging, and even did some Christmas shopping in the nearby town. Chris Stephen, owner of Lilaberry Home Decor in the nearby town of Sidney-by-the-Sea, said Harry came into her store just before Christmas with a protection officer to buy festive table decorations - but in her shock, she mistakenly called him aposPrince Andrewapos. Chris said Harry had a blue woollen hat over his eyes and mumbled in a fake Canadian accent into the collar of his coat. I thought there was something familiar about him, even though I could barely see his face, she said. And then I said, aposOh my God, youaposre Prince Andrew!apos. One of her colleagues corrected her, and Chris said she nearly fainted and must have shrieked. She said she wanted to give him a motherly hug but was asked by the officer to be discreet. We went and had a chat in the storeroom and the first thing Harry said to me - looking horried - was: aposI canapost believe you thought I was Prince Andrew! I told him that I was so overwhelmed I forgot his name. He said he tried to disguise his voice by speaking with a Canadian accent and I told him he made a terrible job of it.  In the end I did give him a hug – a big mum hug – and he was very gracious and patient with me, a real well-mannered guy. It is not known how long Meghan is intending to stay in Canada. Harry is not expected to leave the UK until at least next weekend while he deals with the aftermath of the coupleaposs shock announcement that they would step back from their roles as senior royals. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have said they plan to become financially independent and split their time between the UK and North America. Harry is due to attend a crisis meeting on Monday with the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William on Monday.

She doesn’t remember anything, nobody is aware of what happened.She added: The father should be around  or almost  years old. The mother should be around the same age, they’re both kind of old. Their sister is maybe a couple of years older than Madeleine.

Bethany Robinson, , suffers from bipolar disorder and planned to throw herself in front of a train as she battled through a “dark depression”. It was only when her sister Elouise Gregor, , introduced her to weightlting and CrossFit exercise that Bethany’s condition eased. It proved to be the making of her – literally saving her le. Bethany says: “If Elouise hadn’t have helped me, I wouldnapost be here today.” Now they are the first sisters to take part in SAS: Who Dares Wins – the Channel  show that sees recruits go through brutal special forces training. Bethany, an art teacher from Cornwall, says: “I was in a black hole and didn’t know how to get out. I definitely would have killed myself. “My sister rang my mum the day I’d planned to do it and my mum called the police, who came and got me. “I don’t remember the two months after that because I was in such a deep depression. Elouise hatched a plan to help me. She set up a home gym and encouraged me to start exercising. I began feeling better straight away – it set me on the road to recovery.” Bethany had put on weight during her depression and reached  stone. But after working out, she lost six stone in a year. She has since lost a further stone. The sisters compete in CrossFit and Olympic power-lting and have dozens of podium finishes between them.  Elouise, a solicitor, says: “It was horric seeing Beth being so self-destructive and unhappy. I would have done anything to help her. “She pushed me away, but the gym was the place we reconnected. We became best friends again.” Bethany’s issues began after she left an abusive relationship aged . She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after two particularly bad episodes. She explains: “I was in the darkest depression, but I had lots of energy because I was coming off of a manic period and had been out partying.  “My mind was telling me there was no way out and nothing was ever going to get better. All I could think about was killing myself. It was totally irrational. “It happened twice. The first time, I planned to throw myself under a train. I was determined to do it. Luckily the train station was closed and my sister rang my mum, who called the police. “The second time, I had all these thoughts about killing myself. I banged my head against a wall, because I thoughtI could knock myself out, the thoughts would stop. I got help after those two episodes – I don’t think I’d have survived a third.”  Bethany began counselling and was put on medication in mid-. But by the end of the year, doctors told her it wasn’t working. That’s when Elouise stepped in and encouraged Bethany – who had been sporty in her youth – to start working out. They lted weights in their home gym and Bethany found she was good at it. She says: “I got back into fitness by deadlting – I could lt kg, which is a huge amount for a woman. It made me fall in love with the sport and I started going to CrossFit six times a week with Elouise. I felt the exercise helping straight away. It made me confident. Suddenly I was good at something. “I started to feel so much better about myself. It really brought me closer to my sister. We became best friends again. We encourage each other.”  Exercising was so helpful to Bethany’s mental health that she now no longer has bipolar episodes. She says: “Since I found fitness, my mental health issues have been under control. My mood still fluctuates, but not dramatically. It is now within the normal range. I found that with good sleep, nutrition and exercise, I can control my bipolar. It’s been amazing, I never looked back.” Spurred on by her recovery and her love of fitness, Bethany applied to go on the TV show – and Elouise followed suit. They were invited to a fitness test and got told off for cheering each other on! The show sees contestants pushed to the limits, physically and mentally.  But the sisters – who feature in tonight’s episode – loved every minute. Bethany says: “We communicate without even having to speak, so it was a great support being there together. “With everything I’ve been through, taking part in SAS has actually been a lot of fun. It made me deal with a lot of things, which is a positive. It proved to me I’m stronger than I think I am. “It helped me overcome moments of doubt. It pulls you apart and puts you back together. I wanted to prove that, after my mental health struggles with bipolar disorder, I’m OK now. “I can not only cope with the stresses of competing in a sport and everyday le, but I can take on one of the most stressful and challenging courses and come out just as mentally strong as before. “Having bipolar disorder no longer holds me back.” "},{"url":null,"title":"shoppers being taken fools stores","story":"NewsShoppers being taken for fools with stores passing off real fur as fakeEXCLUSIVE: Investigators bought  fur-trimmed items from markets and stores in Durham, Leeds, London, Newcastle, Stratford-upon-Avon and York, as well as online - All the items were found to contain real animal fur, including a pair of children’s shoes and a baby’s hatShareCommentsByNada FarhoudEnvironment editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsA YouGov poll found nearly half of shoppers rely on the feel and price of fur to decideit is real\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Fur-trimmed jackets, shoes, hats and gloves were found with labels either making no mention of their origins or claiming they are synthetic. Investigators bought  fur-trimmed items ranging from £ to £ from markets and stores in Durham, Leeds, London, Newcastle, Stratford-upon-Avon and York, as well as online. All the items were found to contain real animal fur, including a pair of children’s shoes and a baby’s hat. Claire Bass, director of animal rights organisation Humane Society International UK, said: Buyers beware: the plethora of real fur items we found being sold as faux shows avoiding animal fur continues to be a minefield for shoppers. There’s a misconception thata garment is cheap, it is faux fur.” A £. pair of  shoes from web-site Ego were labelled as “black faux fur” but were found to be fox. A £ pair of kids’ plimsolls from EverythingPounds labelled “faux fur trim” were found to contain rabbit. A £ pair of “faux fur” pink diamante trainers from online fashion store Cucu were found to contain rabbit. A Walthamstow Market trader in East London said the pom-pom on a £ baby’s hat was “fake”. He told investigators: “I don’t have real fur as it’s too expensive.” But tests showed otherwise.  A street vendor in Leeds sold us a £ hat, saying: “It’s not animal fur. It would be more expensive. But the pom-pom was found to be raccoon dog fur. A vendor at Stratford Indoor Market, in east London, said it was “not possible to get a pair of real fur gloves for £”, unaware those he sold had a rabbit trim. A YouGov poll found nearly half of shoppers rely on the feel and price of fur to decideit is real. Many still believe real fur is expensive.  But retailers can bulk-buy rabbit fur trim from online wholesalers for as little as £ a metre. Fur farming was banned in the UK in , with the last farm closing in . But it is still legal to import fur, with millions of pounds’ worth flooding in. Clare Bass said: “In most cases, we don’t believe the vendors are deliberately misleading customers. They genuinely believe what they’re selling is faux fur.  Le’s cheap on a fur farm and that misery is reflected in the rock-bottom price.” Cucu Fashion removed the trainers from its site to investigate. It said: “We work with suppliers from the UK and Europe and were advised they don’t use real fur.We’re disappointed they’ve breached our high standards.” Ego fashion said: “Heel Sassy has been taken off the site to be investigated.”"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast storm brendan","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Storm Brendan to batter Britain with mph galesThe Met Office has warned of travel disruption while Storm Brendan ravages Britains west coast with wind gusts up to mph - Met Office yellow weather warnings are in effectShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  JAN NewsHuge waves will batter seafronts \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailTwo bosses running a vaping business have been blasted for threatening workers with a shameful pay rate of p per hour. Edinburgh-based tycoons Callum and Connor Henderson put the terms into contracts for staff who leave the company without serving a full notice period. Callun,  and Connor, , have become two of Scotlandaposs most successful businessmen after their VPZ electronic cigarette shop chain expanded across the UK, reports the Daily Record. But their harsh contract terms have been deemed to be a breach of a raft of laws by politicians, unions and lawyers. The Sunday Mail revealed the documents showing the terms that workers could end up receiving just p an hour for time worked and holidays owed. After being confronted, the company claimed the clause had since been removed from their terms of employment. But a source said: This was given to a worker in recent years and was the one they were employed under until leaving the company in recent months. It is disgusting to try to treat people like that and it would never stand up in court. The contract states: In the event of an employee leaving the company without the proper notice period being served, the company will make payment of any outstanding hours worked and outstanding holiday entitlement owed by the company which will be calculated at the rate of pper hour.  Lawyer David Martyn, head of Thompsonsapos employment rights unit, believes the terms wouldnapost comply with other laws to protect workers’ rights. He said: If you don’t have statutory rules governing the way people are paid, you will see this sort of punitive clause appearing more regularly. You can see what it is designed to do – punish people for not working their full notice period. But the reality is thatyou have earned holidays, you are entitled to be paid for those under Working Time Regulations, andyou have done work, then you are entitled to be paid at the very least the National Minimum Wage. A contract cannot drop the rate of pay below the National  Minimum Wage  – it is a piece of legislation that is there to provide a floor. A term like that would seem to me to be void because it would be effectively overwritten by the statutory provisions which would be applied by a court. If you broaden this issue out, this is the concern about Brexit and attempts to deregulate the economy. You are in a situation where some of the basic rights that we rely on to create a fair working relationship are easily removed.  Citizens Advice Scotland’s social justice spokesperson Mhoraig Green said: This story will shock people across Scotland. The idea that workers could effectively be paid p an hour in any circumstance is utterly jaw-dropping. “People not knowing their rights at work is an issue and that leads to some companies taking advantage of their workers.” The meteoric success of VPZ has allowed the Henderson brothers to rake it in and splash out. Callum, , lives in a £.million six-bed Edinburgh mansion – complete with cinema and indoor swimming pool – with -year-old girlfriend Liliana Recinos from El Salvador.  Recinos regularly flaunts her extravagant lestyle on Facebook , with pictures of their sprawling home and luxury holidays. Connor, , lives in a turreted, seven-bed Victorian mansion set in two acres of land near Linlithgow, West Lothian, with his girlfriend Hrafnhildur Matthiasdottir, from Iceland, and their two daughters. The brothers started with a single shop in Edinburgh’s Leith in  but now have  outlets across Britain and  staff.

Plain and simple. While many sympathise with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s desire to step back as senior Royals, the way they chose to do it has provoked justiable shock and outrage. Petulant, hot-headed and impulsive are just some of the barbs aimed at the couple after the bombshell public announcement that they wished to become part-time Royals and live much of the time abroad. Inconsiderate, disloyal and reckless might also be appropriate. In more than  years on the throne, the Queen has shown with impeccable style, dignity and judgement how the “old firm” should be run. The sacrices she and other members of the Royal Family have made have been not only for the monarchy, but for the nation.  That, by the antiquated system of a monarchic state, is their responsibility by birth. And Her Majesty embraced that responsibility with grace, as even republicans admit. Harry and Meghan’s wish to break away might be seen as an understandable cry for modernisation. Their desire to do so has been evident for a long time. But discussing their intentions with friends such as Elton John before the Queen, and going ahead with their announcement without thinking through the full impact on their family or the monarchy, has caused a totally avoidable crisis. That the Queen has had to intervene – calling a Royal showdown at Sandringham tomorrow to deal with the crisis – is a measure of the scale of the embarrassment caused.  She is right to step in and call the wayward couple to heel. Only she has the authority to bang heads together and ensure a smoother route to whatever the future holds. The Wrong Cure  The crisis in our health service starts at the front line, the family doctor. The GP is an absolute cornerstone of the National Health Service, the first stop for all ages from cradle to grave. It is a service that is essential to personal health, and to the economy of the country. With a shortage of at least , GPs, Tory promises of more on the way are not enough. Government action on over-complicated red tape preventing overseas doctors from coming here to ease the gap is long overdue. Rocking On Rod Stewart is a national treasure who just refuses to act his age.

And everything changed soon after Charlotte fell under his influence at the age of . She moved away from her home town to live with him. And within a year she was dead. Chef Miller, , pretended his fiancée had disappeared but was ­convicted of her murder after a long police investigation. As he awaits a le sentence, he refuses to tell officers how he killed Charlotte or where he disposed of her body. Tonight her twin Denise, , spoke of the family’s agony at not knowing what happened. She said: “We can’t come to terms with it. We can’t move on because we don’t have the end of the story. “We have no grave to visit. We have nowhere to go and say a prayer and leave flowers.” Denise will never forget the beginning of the ordeal that led to discovering her sister’s death. It began with her waking from a restless sleep one night. “I felt like I was being choked and like someone had thrown something in my face,” she said. “I sat there coughing and spluttering in the dark, panicked because I couldn’t breathe. “When I got my breath back I just lay there, frightened, and the nerves of it stayed with me for a few days. I was anxious and emotional and I couldn’t figure out why.  “Nothing like that had ever happened to me before.” Denise believes the night it happened in November  could have been the night Charlotte was killed. Police think her sister was murdered about then. At the trial last October, prosecution lawyers said Miller killed his fiancée in a ­“murderous rage” and that on the morning of her disappearance she had sent him explicit images of herself with his friend. The court heard that he later went ­online looking to buy an axe, a saw and cleaning materials. Jurors rejected his claim that he bought them as a Christmas gt for his father.  And his story that she had moved away to start a new le was “riddled with ­inconsistencies, inaccuracies and lies”. The jury took three hours toa unanimous guilty verdict at Northern Ireland’s crown court, Dungannon. Denise said: “Right through the trial Miller maintained that Charlotte could still be alive. “It was horrendous. I’ve known for a long time she’s gone and the police have too. “Miller saying that made the whole ordeal worse. “We were terried he might lead the jury down the garden path to believe she wasn’t dead. Thankfully they saw through his lies.” Charlotte and Denise were born on Christmas Day , numbers six and seven in a family of . Charlotte arrived first.  “She was always the boss,” says Denise. “She was born two minutes before me and that’s the way it continued. “We were tomboys, ­always in the thick of things. Playing in the mud, climbing trees and because we were a pair we never needed anyone . We always had each other and we felt each other’s pain. “She put weight on when I was pregnant and she felt it when I was in labour.  “We had the same scars on our hands and our foreheads too.” Charlotte lived most of her le near her mother and siblings in Omagh, Co Tyrone.  But within months of meeting Miller through work in late  she moved more than  miles to live with him in the town of Moy. “She seemed besotted with him,” said Denise. “But none of us had met him. We didn’t even know where ­exactly she lived to go and visit.” It turned out none of the family had seen Charlotte for months before she died. “We’d met all of her previous boyfriends. The suddenly she’d upped and left with someone none of us knew,” said Denise.  “We should have made more of a fuss about it but we didn’t want to upset her because things could be tricky with Charlotte sometimes. I think now that he was controlling her. Denise and Charlotte fell out over a petty row in March  and never spoke again. “I thought it would blow over,” said mum-of-two Denise. “But with her being away, and me being busy with the kids, before we got a chance to make it up, it was too late.” The family became increasingly worried so they contacted Miller who agreed to meet Denise and one of her brothers in March . “Miller told us she’d got a loan out and a new passport, and he made out like she’d gone off on holiday without telling anyone. “At that time we believed him. We were actually annoyed that she’d gone off without a word to any of us. I feel so gullible now, and sickened that I bought his lies. We reported her missing that May.”  With another Christmas ­behind her – and another birthday she should have shared with her sister – Denise is fighting to stay positive that a clue will lead them to Charlotte’s grave. “In birthday cards from my brothers and sisters, they always address them to me and Charlotte because it’s not just my birthday. It’s lovely that she is never forgotten. It’s as much her birthday as it as mine.” A new law in England will soon deny murderers parolethey refuse to reveal the location of their victim’s remains. But as yet there are no such plans in Northern Ireland for a version of Helen’s Law – named after Helen McCourt, , who was killed by publican Ian Simms in .  “We’ll fight for that too,” said Denise. “We need that equivalent law, one we want to call Charlotte’s Law in Northern Ireland because leaving ­families in this state is cruel. “I’m lost without her. We all are. It’s so hard for my mum.It feels like sometimes when she looks at me she sees Charlotte.

Because Shanice, , who has cystic fibrosis, was the first person in Britain to have her le saved by a set of lungs in a box. The ground-breaking medical invention has now saved  lives worldwide by keeping removed donor organs “breathing” while they are transported for transplant. And the OCS – Organ Care System – can even improve lungs not considered good enough for transplant, like those in Shanice’s chest. They had been ­rejected by four transplant centres when they arrived in front of surgeon Marius Berman at the Royal Papworth in Cambridge in November . q He realised the OCS box could make the lungs of a -year-old donor ­usable again – and Shanice, of Darlington, Co Durham, got the call. She’d been on the transplant list since April  as CF ravaged her body. By November, after marrying welder Robert Moncur, she was running out of le. “In my wedding photos I can see my collar bones sticking out – I’m ft ins and I was just over st,” she says. “It was a lovely day but I was so weak. Soon I needed oxygen every night to sleep.” Three ­-mile dashes to Papworth that summer ended in vain when donor lungs were deemed unsuitable.  Then came the fourth call. Lung and heart transplant surgeon Marius believed he could make this trip worth it using the machine that mimics the body, breathing oxygen into the lungs and feeding them with blood.It also allows doctors to ­assess and eliminate infection, excess fluid and any clotting. “When we have the lungs in the box we can test them thoroughly,” says Marius, . “And do things that will raise their quality. “The UK has one of the sickest donor populations in Europe. Fteen per cent of all organs are not usable. And for lungs it’s worse.  “So the only way forward is to try to get the best out of every set we get. “Sometimes it’s clear lungs aren’t suitable but often we are looking at organs we would call ‘marginal’. “If you have the box you can do things to make them useful. Without the transplant that day, it would have been highly unlikely the patient would have lived much longer.” Shanice only learned her case was a UK first after surgery. “I Googled the box and was wowed by how clever it was,” she said. “When I found my lungs would have otherwise gone to waste I was amazed. I’m so grateful to the medical staff and the donor and his family.  “Within a few months I was doing things I’d never done – going out with friends more, walking the dogs and exercise classes. It saved and changed my le.” Since Shanice’s op, a further four successful transplants have ­already been carried out using the box.  It is made by a US firm called TransMedics, which has also ­pioneered devices for liver and heart transplants. The company has agreed to fund the OCS – which adds around £, to the £, cost of a lung transplant – for the next year. After that, it is hoped NHS England will fund it.

However, Dark Blues keeper Jack Hamilton gathered the header comfortably.Hamilton then made a smart stop from a whipped Keatings free-kick minutes later as the visitors continued to push for the opener.On  minutes Charlie Trafford forced a routine save out of Hamilton before, just a minute later, Inverness got the goal their play deserved.In acres of space down the right, full-back Shaun Rooney had the freedom of Dens Park to pick out Doran in the centre of the box and the Irish attacker duly lashed home from  yards.On  minutes, ICT were two to the good. From their own corner, Dundee compounded to lose possession and allowed the Highlanders to break.Former Dundee United man Keatings led the charge and finished the counter attack off himself, coolly slotting beyond a helpless Hamilton in the home goal.The Dark Blues huffed and puffed for the remainder of a dismal first half for them but were unable to lay a glove on Inverness as the boos rang out among the sizeable home support on the half-time whistle.Four minutes into the second period, Dundee forced Mark Ridgers into his first save of the afternoon as the ICT goalie stooped to turn Jordan Marshall#s long-range effort behind for a corner.Jordan McGhee was next to test Ridgers, firing in a dipping effort just before the hour mark, but the Caley stopper was able to gather.Moments later, Paul McGowan#s header from a deep Sean Mackie cross forced Ridgers to tip over as the Dee sought a way back into the contest.On  minutes, Kane Hemmings laid in Marshall but the left-back saw his effort from  yards deflected behind.Inverness# front four continued to look threatening but, largely, the Dee defence kept them quiet in the second .However, McPake#s men were unable to carve a way through an organised ICT defence with the rookie boss cutting a frustrated and under-pressure figure throughout.With Ayr and Dunfermline to face next, Dundee will certainly need to perform a lot betterthey are to stay in the mix for the promotion play-offs come the end of the season.Dundee XI : HamiltonKerr, Meekings , McGhee, Marshall Robertson, Dorrans, McGowan, MackieJohnson , Hemmings.Subs not used: Ferrie , Forster, Byrne, Moore and Cameron.Inverness XI : RidgersRooney, Donaldson, McHattie, TremarcoTrafford , Vincent StoreyKeatings Doran Todorov .Subs not used: Mackay , McCart, Curry and MacGregor.Referee: Don Robertson.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/SNS-19595223-Dundee-United-v-Dunfermline-803x564.jpg ","title":"lawrence shankland has full focus on united as they hunt title","story":"He’s a wanted man in the January transfer window but Dundee United hitman Lawrence Shankland says it would be criminal for him to take his eyes off the prize as they hunt down the Championship title.United sit  points clear at the top of the table with  games left to play and -goal talisman Shanks insists his full focus is on getting the Tangerines over the line, not the speculation linking him with a move away from Tannadice.The -year-old Scotland striker has been linked with teams both sides of the border but he says until United tell him dferently, it’s all guns blazing in their quest for silverware.“I don’t take interest in it, to be honest,” he said.“I’ve said before that until someone from Dundee United comes to speak to me about it then it’s none of my business really.“It’s all just speculation and rumours, so I won’t take any interest in it at all.“If the time comes when somebody does speak to me then I’ll deal with it then but it’s not something I’m getting too caught up with.“I’m really enjoying it here and the team’s going well, firing at the top of the league, so I don’t see why I’d be choking to get out.“We need to be looking forward now because we’ve got ourselves a good gap at the top.“It would be silly for us to ignore that because we’ve got ourselves in a good position but that’s only the case right now.“We need to kick on and keep winning games because,we keep doing that, the closer we’ll get and the less wins we’ll need.“Until that point we’ll just need to keep taking it one game at a time, batting them off and picking up three points most weeks.”Shankland will come up against his former boss at Ayr United, Ian McCall, as the Terrors head to Glasgow to take on his current side Partick Thistle tomorrow.And he admits United are wary of a team who have won three out of their last five in the league.“It’s going to be a tough game, especially down there,” he added.“Last time we were - down and had to come back after half-time. Up here it was tight at - until about the hour mark and then we got the goal.“From going in front in both games it was all about defending and seeing it out.

It just took Clarky to get his first goal and then he kicked on from there.“It’s the same for a lot of people but I don’t really care who scores, to be honest, as long as we’re picking up three points each week I’ll be quite happy.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/19787695-940x545.jpg ","title":"partick thistle 1 4 dundee united perfect hat trick from shankland sends utd 17 clear","story":"Dundee United went  points clear at the top of the Championship as a perfect hat-trick from Lawrence Shankland sent them on their way to aShankland opened the scoring at Firhill with a header on  minutes, with strikes on either foot coming in the second half after Adrian Sporle had made it - on the stroke of half-time.Kenny Miller pulled a late goal back for the Jags but three points means the Tangerines are now  points clear of Inverness at the top of the Championship.United showed two changes from last weekend#s win at Queen of the South with captain Mark Reynolds and new boy Dillon Powers coming in for his debut in place of Jamie Robson and Calum Butcher.Partick had an early penalty shout for handball but referee Willie Collum waved away the claims and instead pointed for a corner.Lawrence Shankland headed straight at Scott Fox in the home goal from a deep Nicky Clark free-kick moments later as the game began to settle down.Benjamin Siegrist in the United net had the simplest of saves from James Penrice on  minutes before Declan Glass dragged a shot wide up the other end.The cut-up pitch, due to the wet conditions in Glasgow, saw much of the build-up from both teams bogged down but, of the good football on show, it was the Terrors with the lion#s share.Glass troubled Fox again on  minutes with a dipping, bouncing effort. However, the best chance of the opening half hour was the Jags#.A lung-busting run from Dario Zanatta nearly paid idends for the hosts but Siegrist#s legs foiled the Canadian inside the penalty area.Paul Watson saw a header drt wide from a Clark delivery before Shankland teed up Glass, only for the -year-old to fire wide once again.Zanatta once more came close on  minutes, this time glancing a Joe Cardle delivery towards goal but into the grateful arms of Siegrist.Just a minute later, the Tangerines No  was again the thorn in Thistle#s side.On his own in the six-yard box, Kenny Miller picked up on Zanatta#s cross only for the big Swiss keeper to pull off a wonder save to deny Miller from close range.Clark forced Fox into action with an audacious effort from some  yards before the former Dundee keeper halted Shankland close in.However, moments later, Shanks wasn#t to be denied his nd United goal of the season.From a Clark corner, the Scotland star had the freedom of the Thistle box to guide a header beyond a helpless Fox for - on  minutes.And Shankland was at the heart of United#s second. Picking up on the ball in the middle of the Partick half, he drove forward and slipped in Glass.The United kid#s cross-cum-shot found Adrian Sporle with the simplest of tasks to tap home unopposed for his first league goal for the club.After a frenetic first period, the second  took a while to get going but it was Ian McCall#s side on the front foot.Just before the hour-mark, the impressive Reece Cole made a powerful run into the box before his effort won the Jags a corner.However, it was United who got the scoring under way in the second half and took control with the first chance of note in the period.And it was that man Shankland again as he went on a terric -yard solo run into the Partick box before calmly slotting beyond Fox for his second of the afternoon and the Terrors# third.Peter Pawlett completed his comeback from injury on  minutes when he replaced Paul Watson.And, just a minute later, his first involvement in the game was to tee up Shankland for his third, completing a perfect hat-trick by thundering a left-foot drive into the top corner to send the ,-strong visiting support wild.One of few worries for United on the afternoon came on  minutes when Clark had to limp off injured, to be replaced by Adam King.Miller netted a late consolation for Thistle on  minutes but Robbie Neilson#s men took all the points and another step towards sealing the title.Partick

include internal works first which people won’t be able to see.”As well as the removal of the old main arena building, the covered walkway that connects to the section of the conference centre next to the Holiday Inn Express will also be removed.It is expected that the value of the work to be undertaken will be around £,.The warrant has an expiry date of January   and all work must be completed by then.It is understood that the remaining conference centre will be retained as well as the nearby park-and-ride facility.Talks regarding the future use of the site are still ongoing.Plans were

have been no official approaches to the Dons for either wanted man this month … so far.Aberdeen, at a warm-weather training camp in Dubai, are braced for that to potentially change before the window closes.However, McInnes is confidentoffers are tabled for Cosgrove or McKenna this month the Dons will be in the driving seat in negotiations.English Premier side Burnley are understood to have joined the race to land McKenna with Championship QPR also set to resurrect their interest.QPR had a bid for McKenna rejected last summer in a window where the centre-back slapped in a transfer request.Middlesbrough, Derby County and Stoke City are interested in leading scorer Cosgrove who is already on  goals for the season.McInnes, who has Cosgrove and McKenna tied on to long term contracts, said: “I would be surprisedthere was no interest in them.“I know both players have admirers out there. However, I cannot wake up every morning fretting about that.“I have to concentrate on what we have and we are fortunate we have two very good players in very good form.“Scott, in the last six weeks, has been fantastic and Sam, for the last period, has been fantastic.“For the two games Sam was suspended we picked up four points against Livingston and Hearts which I was pleased about to an extent.“However, with Sam in the team performances are normally better as he is very influential for us.“I wouldn’t want to lose either player in this window.“Do I expect interest  The likelihood is that clubs are probably considering making offers for both of them.“It will be up to Daveand the board to look at any offers for any of our players.”Aberdeen have already rejected multiple offers for McKenna including a £.m bid from Aston Villa in summer .McKenna is contracted until summer  but slapped in a transfer request towards the end of the English transfer deadline last season.The centre-back was also the subject of rejected bids from QPR and Nottingham Forest during last summer’s window.Leading scorer Cosgrove is contracted to the Dons until summer  having signed a two-year extension last January.Middlesbrough recently sent assistant manager Robbie Keane to scout him at a game.However, new club chairman Cormack recently underlined Aberdeen do not have to sell their star assets this month.McInnes admitted that was “music to his ears and the supporters” when hearing of Cormack’s commitment to retaining the club’s star players for now.However, Cormack also accepted that a major cash bid may force the Dons’ hand to cash in.That is the reality of football at every level, but the Aberdeen manager believes the Dons are in the driving seat with any potential bids.He said: “Both players have committed to the club in signing contracts in good faith.“We have been good for them and they recognise that.“At the same time we are not in a rush to sell but understand both players have a value.“Both players have shown enough in their performances that they can go and play at a higher level.“Eventually these boys will get there.”"},{"url":null,"title":"meet rg mowat owner of the fulmar","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAt the end of November we asked readers for help to unravel the mystery of a yacht log book which was posted to the paper with no clues as to its origin.And, not for the first time, Argyllshire Advertiser readers have come up trumps and we now know a little more about the boat#s owner, named only as RG Mowat in the log book.The  log book gives an account of the voyages of the -foot gaff cutter #Fulmar# and the adventures of her colourful crew. Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event. And to Gavin #Top Tog# Brown, who has been an avid rally man for years and continued to watch us all through the lens, capturing some of our most heroic moments. was a busy year, with a few of us still tinkering away in sheds.  will hopefully see theof Ally and Del Galbraith in their #new# MK Escort and Donald Bowness in the giant killing Nova making aafter some time out.PICS:Dougie Watt and Ian Parker flying in Finland before winning in Aberdeen Photo: Jii Pihlaja. no_a_RallyFinlandFather and son duo Craig and Ross Callendar came in th overall at this year#s Mull Rally.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

It now seems that Dutch taxpayers are subsidising our failing train services. This is on top of the Scottish Government subsidies, which make up about half of its pound billion revenues.We need a viable solution to ScotRailrsquos woes, and terminating franchises early or nationalisation is not the answer. We need better accountability and long-term planning to ensure we see the fortunes of ScotRail turn around.The Borders tourism can offer a more peaceful alternative to bustling CapitalI was not surprised to see that Edinburgh was revealed as having the fourth highest ratio of tourists to locals in the world.

Statistics show there are nearly  tourists for every  residents in Edinburgh, and it begs the question, are we really managing the impact of tourism well Annually our Capital city is influxed with tourists for the Hogmanay celebrations and the Fringe. Whilst it great to see tourism booming in Edinburgh, we need to see more affirmative action to encourage tourists to see more of Scotland, including the Borders. We are located only an hour south of Edinburgh, yet we see very little of the footfall.We need to see incentives and drivers for visitors to explore outside of Edinburgh. Encouraging rural tourism is at the top of my list, and I believe the Scottish Government need to make it a priority to ensure that our overcrowded capital does not suffer, when rural areas have a more peaceful and less stressful visitor experience on offer."},{"url":null,"title":"polar-bear-expert-deliver-talk-galashiels","story":"THE Arctic is ground-zero for climate change, and polar bears are on the front line.Yet, therersquos still a whole lot to learn about these magnicent animals.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road.

Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the latest in a series of important milestones that have brought us a step closer to progressing plans for sustainable economic development."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-test-rocket-engines-former-cockenzie-power-station-site-rejected","story":"Skyrorarsquos bid to set up a base on where the sitersquos former coal handling plant stood had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall.

The Prince of Wales does not extract his millions from this vast landholding through any merit or talent of his own. He is able to employ squads of professionals to help him and give credence to the subsistence lie.Only the oldest surviving son of the monarch gets to use it as his own personal cash cow. No women can get their mitts on it and no Catholics either. In st century Britain we allow this family of property thieves to prevent Catholics contaminating their bloodline, unless of course they first renounce their faith.Our maintenance of this family in their palaces and their multi-million pound lestyles mocks any pretensions this country has to values of equality, justice and honesty. For how can we proclaim these virtues and propel our young people towards them when we permit medieval feudalism and grievous discrimination to flourish at the heart of British society We always want the next generation to learn from the mistakes of past ones and to become better than us. This, though, becomes a pointless exercise when we seem to celebrate and bow down to the Royal Family and its ancient, unearned privileges. Here, mediocrity is rewarded entitlement is encouraged and true merit is scorned.If Prince Harry and Meghan Markel genuinely want to decouple from this seedy fiefdom then I wish them every success. The nation wonrsquot be convinced, though, until we see a set of accounts that doesnrsquot include income from the civil list or the spoils of th century conquest. And until we lose the rest of them Britain will never be entitled to call itself a modern, civilised country."},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-scottish-labours-position-worse-thought","story":"A Wisden-like slew of statistics, itrsquos invaluable for shining a light on the overlooked details of the result.The latest contains some fascinating nuggets about the  vote in Scotland, especially about Labourrsquos fortunes.The partyrsquos Scottish executive, which meets in Glasgow today to discuss its response to that thrashing, might want a stf drink before reading it.For Scottish Labourrsquos result is even worse than it looked at first glance.The headlines were the loss of six of seven MPs, saved from a total wipe-out by Ian Murray in Edinburgh South, and its vote share falling from . per cent to .%, putting it third behind the Tories.While Labour only just came third in , it was decisively beaten by the Tories in , the gap between the two widening from . to . per cent.But look deeper and you really see how far the party has sunk.There have been five general elections in Scotland on the same boundaries, so some gruesome trends are discernible.In  and , Labour won  and  of Scotlandrsquos  seats with vote shares of .% and .% respectively.Many of the safest Labour seats in the UK were then in Scotland.

Tony Blairrsquos majority in Sedgefield was only the third largest.In every Scottish seat, Labour candidates always polled at least %The SNP tsunami of  obviously changed that, but not just by washing away every Labour MP bar Mr Murray.There was new phenomenon.Labour effectively became electorally irrelevant in several Scottish seats.Candidates started losing deposits for the first time in decades.Labour lost three deposits - after polling less than % - across the entire UK in . All three were in Scotland.Labourrsquos share of the vote also fell below % in a dozen Scottish seats.The picture briefly improved in Mr Corbynrsquos half-decent loss of .There were no lost deposits in the UK, and Labourrsquos vote share was down to single figures in only three Scottish seats.But last month those worrying trends for Labour reasserted themselves.In , Labour won m votes in Scotland. Last month it was half that.The party lost  deposits across the UK. Seven were in Scotland.Its vote fell in all  Scottish seats, and went below % in  - single figure support in a third of the country.The Tories also lost seats and vote share in Scotland. But in only two seats did they drop into single figures, and there were no lost deposits.The SNP, which had an overall vote share of %, only fell below % in a single seat, Mr Murrayrsquos, and even there they managed a respectable .%.Labourrsquos vote was squeezed left, right and centre. It lost deposits in seats won by the SNP, the Tories and LibDems.It previous supporters abandoned it to vote tactically or just plain abandoned it.In Dumfries  Galloway, which it won in  with .% of the vote, Labour was down to a humbling .%.In large parts of Scotland, Labour is disappearing from the electoral map.A fallen giant, its carcass is being systematically stripped clean by other parties scavenging for votes.So what to do  Scottish leader Richard Leonard has announced he is leading a review of the election, with the party told to expect some ldquohard lessons.Herersquos a hard lesson for him. He should step aside from the review because hersquos part of the problem.In two colourless years as leader, he has lost both his MEPs, six of his MPs, andhe carries on as before, a good lot of his MSPs in  as well.He has just not connected with voters.He never tried to step out of Mr Corbynrsquos shadow. Worse, he seems more fired up by Labour party history than your tomorrow.Irsquove yet to hear his big vision for Scotland in the st century. But Irsquove lost count of his reveries about Mary Barbour and the Glasgow rent strikes of  years ago, or eulogies for Keir Hardie and other sepia-tinted ghosts.Itrsquos a comfort blanket. Therersquos not a single vote in any of it. Not one.The review will also cover the partyrsquos ldquoconstitutional offer. This boils down to whether it supports a second referendum on independence.Mr Leonard was initially opposed to Indyref, then caved in to Mr Corbyn and John McDonnell when they said Labour shouldnrsquot stand in the way of it.But now party members may be asked whether to actively embrace Indyref, as the outgoing general secretary of the STUC, Grahame Smith, has advised.There has been some harking back to the s, when Labourrsquos offer was a Scottish Parliament subject to a referendum. Back then the party was behind both the end and the means.However for Scottish Labour to back Indyref, but not back independence, would be a far harder trick to pull off.Hence Mr Leonard floating the idea of a multiple-choice referendum, with independence and devo max or federalism against the status quo.This might seem like a clever fudge.The SNP and Greens would back independence in such a scenario, Labour and the LibDems more devolution, leaving the Tories as the party offering Scotland an empty plate.But would voters really be bowled over by it  Ever greater devolution is already the direction of travel for Holyrood. The public expects it.Presenting it as a great leap forward requiring yet another trip to the polls is unlikely to earn much thanks.The setting up of Holyrood was a huge change. Independence obviously would be. But more powers Federalism would also require parallel devolution in Englandrsquos regions. Scottish Labour canrsquot guarantee that.Kezia Dugdale tried it, touting a ldquonew Act of Union as a federal riposte to independence. It sank without trace.Then there are the mechanics of a three-way vote, and the row over them.A first-past-the-post system could, in theory, deliver independencejust over a third of voters backed it. Under the single transferable vote, it could win out with even fewer first preferences.In the end, the need for a clear and authoritative result would make a re-run of rsquos binary choice between independence or the Union inevitable.Labour members shouldnrsquot be gulled into thinking there is a soft third-way optionIndyref ever comes to pass.Nicola Sturgeon doesnrsquot want Devo Max on the ballot. A decade ago, it might have seemed akin to a win for SNP, but not after Brexit. A Devo Max Scotland would still be outside the EU.In the panicky aftermath of defeat, a new constitutional offer might seem a key step in Scottish Labourrsquos recovery. But its problems are not so easily fixed.Its fall owes more to socio-economic and demographic change eroding its base and a decade of inadequate leadership both sides of the border.Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn couldnrsquot cut it. Iain Gray and Johann Lamont couldnrsquot dent Alex Salmond, and Ms Dugdale and Mr Leonard have been no match for Nicola Sturgeon.Scottish Labourrsquos best hope is an electable UK leader who can earn the party a second look from voters.Adopting a new position on Indyref didnrsquot help Mr Corbyn and it wonrsquot make a winner out of Mr Leonard."},{"url":null,"title":"300-mile-route-via-dumfries-ayr-new-north-coast-500","story":"But now tourism bosses are turning the spotlight on the south-west of Scotland in the latest Route -style campaign to lure visitors to the regionrsquos beauty spots.The campaign by Visit South West Scotlandaims to raise awareness of the circular -mile South West Coastal touring route through Dumfries and Galloway and South Ayrshire.The SWV was designed by Motorcycle Scotland and adapted by tourist chiefs to take in more local attractions.: North Coast  taken over by Scotlands biggest landownerThe road trip takes in the south-west coastline from Ayr to Cairngaan via Stranraer and Portpatrick, before passing along the south of Scotland through Wigtown, Kirkcudbright and Castle Douglas, then heading inland to Dumfries.From there the remainder of the route loops round via Lockerbie, Moffat, Sanquhar, New Cumnock, Dalmellington and Maybole.The new digital campaign, funded with pound, from VisitScotland, is geared to making visitors ldquofall in love with south-west Scotland by showcasing aspects of the route which offer particular appeal to the key target markets such as its scenery, wildle and adventure sports.Ian McAndrew, chairman of Visit South West Scotland, said: ldquoThe south-west of Scotland is a special place, it has so much to offer, especially to lovers of the great outdoors and that is a message we are working hard to get out there.ldquoAs a trade organisation, collaboration is at the core of what we do, we rely on our members and our strategic partners to get behind our efforts to make a real dference to tourism in the South West.ldquoTherefore when VisitScotland agreed to support our promotional campaign for the South West Coastal , a touring route that encourages visitors to explore our region, we were delighted.Tourist bosses will market the SWC Touring Road Route to the rest of the UK and Ireland in an online drive featuring short films, images and itineraries, and promotional activity on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram by ldquoinfluencers ndash people with tens of thousands of social media followers.They expect the campaign to reach more than , people via social media and at least double traffic to the South West Coastal  landing page on the VSWS website.: Burns worth over poundm to Scottish economyPaula Ward, VisitScotland Regional Leadership Director, said: ldquoWith its stunning coastal and inland landscapes, peaceful atmosphere and fantastic attractions, the south-west of Scotland is a great visitor destination and the SWC is the perfect route for experiencing it.ldquoIrsquom thrilled we were able to support this exciting new campaign and I canrsquot wait to see the outputs.ldquoAt VisitScotland we want to champion collaboration, spearhead digital innovation and promote local areas to make sure every part of Scotland enjoys the benefits of tourism.The latest tourism drive comes after the success of the North Coast , which was developed as a way to bring visitors to hidden parts of the Scottish Highlands and give economic benefits to struggling communities.The -mile route ndash dubbed Scotlandrsquos answer to Route , the famous US highway linking Chicago to Santa Monica ndash was essentially a rebranding of an existing system of roads that had been around for decades.It begins at Inverness Castle before heading north to John OrsquoGroats and looping back around along the north-west coast via Durness, Lochinver and Applecross.It takes in breathtaking countryside, including the infamous hairpin bends of the Bealach na Ba, secluded northern beaches, distilleries, smokehouses and farm shops, and was recently named the most spectacular drive in the UK.Visitors can have their NC ldquopassport stamped at attractions along the route.Its twisting single-track road have proven particularly popular with cyclists and motorists, including the owners of supercars, although residents living along the route have complained that its popularity was causing disruption.

Indeed, didnrsquot Labourrsquos manesto or programme or policy on the hoof indicate a similar aspiration causing much frothing at the mouth in right-wing newspaper offices up and also down the land Itrsquos something you should always remember. All the talk about freedom, sovereignty, civil rights, this liberty, that liberty and parliamentary politics generally is just froth. All that really matters is the economy, by which is meant profiting from the labour of others. Threaten that with strikes or shorter days and you will feel hellip The Wrath.But thatrsquos old hat. The six-hour day is new hat, though I think it already happens in Sweden, where itrsquos reported to have created happier, wealthier and more productive employees. Well, therersquos a surprise. In Japan, experimenting with a three-day weekend increased productivity at Microsoft there by . per cent.Britain, unfortunately, tends to believe that the only good worker is an unhappy worker. Itrsquos deeply felt that this is a natural law. I remember, about  years ago, a group of Danes coming to our then workplace and being appalled by the long, macho hours and presenteeism, all of which was just stretching out incompetence.Our bemused visitors could sense this right away. Longer hours did not mean that more got done. My memory of offices and the eight-hour day is that at least six and a half of them were wasted.Unlike we Britlanders, Scandinavians have a reputation for getting their work done and leaving the office early. But do we really want to do that  What would we do when we got home  Given more time there, wersquod only waste it, same as we did at work.Ms Marin mentioned families, but these are old hat nowadays and nobody can be bothered starting one, what with all the hassle and mess.No, the second report that caught my eye regarding what we do with our time was one that said people were being referred to counsellors and therapists for binge-watching box-sets and Netflix in their spare time. Some, indeed, were doing it at work, putting their jobs at risk, and the few that still had old-fashioned families were putting a strain on these too.So, therersquos your choice: work or binge-watch telly. You say: ldquoNot me, pal. Irsquod be oot walking the hills or writing a novel, ken  This news just in: no, you wouldnrsquot. You wouldnrsquot know what to do with your time.Experience teaches that the more time you have to do something the less you do it. Itrsquos just another of lersquos irritating conundrums. That said, we all want more time. Most of us have wasted our lives so far, but we still want more time so we can squander it.All that said, Irsquove never understood the eight-hour working day. Who decided that  Wersquove had it for more than  years and, for all the ldquoprogress, nothing has changed. Theyrsquove even taken away our lunch hours. But I havenrsquot time to go into that here.Stirring wordsITrsquoS time for a wee declaration. A Declaration of Arbroath, that is. Draw up in  by Scotlandrsquos then leaders, it contains probably the most stirring words of resistance and principle ever written by the human hand.To wit: ldquoAs long as but a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be brought under English rule. It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours, that we are fighting, but for freedom ndash for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with le itself.The best thing about it is that it was written before people could leave comments below the line saying it was anti-English and deluded in thinking that Scotland could run its own affairs without funding through the Longshanks Formula.Seven hundred years on, the document is to go on display for the first time in  years, inspiring among foreign visitors romantic thoughts of national liberation and the accountability of monarchs to the people. Scottish people, meanwhile, will worry what effect it might have on their pensions and whether it might not be better just to keep sending our money south and getting some of it back every year.The truth is out thereFOR some time now, hopes have started to fade that there might be aliens out there who could come and save us from ourselves. Wersquove built mightier and mightier telescopes and still canrsquot see a thing.YouTube shows us film of UFOs, which are always rubbish, always blurred and always just reflected light from below.

Well,thatrsquos so, theyrsquore certainly keeping their heids doon, assuming they even have heids.Maybe they think wersquod persecute them. Maybe they donrsquot want to become celebrities.

There was a real possibility that the Queen might have had to decide whether or not to endorse a caretaker prime minister.This monarch should be the last to have any formal role in the constitution. The Crown should no longer be seen as above politics. The hereditary principle should play no part in our democracy.It goes without saying that therersquos no place for royalty in Scotland. The Scottish National Party needs to reassess its historical support for the Queen. Alex Salmond called her the ldquoQueen of Scots, and the  White Paper envisaged a role for the monarch in Scotland after independence.

Criticism of Harry and Meghanrsquos hypocrisy in lecturing on the environment while relying on private jets is not racist.In the Sussexesrsquo resignation epistle there is no mention of racism. They clearly donrsquot like their treatment by the press. But their court actions against the media are about phone hacking and , not race.Meghan Markle was lionised by the press when she arrived on the scene three years ago. The media was fascinated and enchanted by this woke princess who was bringing the stuffy royal family into the st century.The coverage in all newspapers was little short of adulatory. Her feminism was widely praised she adorned the front page of Vogue her wedding had the full -inside-pages treatment.Meghanrsquos arrival was seen as a signicant moment in the progress towards equality and ersity in Britain. Her departure comes as a blow to minority groups which saw her as a torch-bearer for anti-racism and anti-sexism. As a royal she had a unique  now she is just another self-obsessed celebrity.And the royalsrsquo behaviour following the Epstein scandal is a serious blow to The Firm. It is clear that the monarchy, as it stands, is no longer viable. It will have to downsize to immunise itself from scandals like this in future.Questions about the anachronistic constitutional role of the Queen can no longer be avoided.She is head of state, a formal role of course, but one that nearly became highly political during the Brexit crisis last year. There was a real possibility that the Queen might have had to decide whether or not to endorse a caretaker prime minister.This monarch should be the last to have any formal role in the constitution. The Crown should no longer be seen as above politics. The hereditary principle should play no part in our democracy.It goes without saying that therersquos no place for royalty in Scotland. The Scottish National Party needs to reassess its historical support for the Queen. Alex Salmond called her the ldquoQueen of Scots, and the  White Paper envisaged a role for the monarch in Scotland after independence. This is surely no longer tenable.If Scotland is to become independent, there should be no question of a hereditary head of state. And there is surely no place for celebrity airheads like the Sussexes."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10891958.jpg?type=article-full","title":"meet-new-generation-baby-boomers-scotlands-islands","story":"Spanning just  miles by six, perched on the edge of the Western Isles and with a single-track road as its main highway, Barrarsquos largely unoccupied hilly interior is offset by sandy beaches hugged by the grassy machair.Picture-postcard pretty, remote, lonely, very windswept and loved by tourists, it is perhaps the last place on Earth that might seem likely to be gripped by a population explosion.Yet the patter of very tiny feet is set to sound very loudly across the island.At least  women are said to be currently pregnant ndash a remarkable number on an island with a population of just over ,.Not only that, but two years ago the number of babies also hit double digits with  births.ldquoMaybe itrsquos something in the water or too many power cuts, says one bemused local currently counting the weeks to the arrival of his second Barra baby.But while the baby boom has sparked countless ldquonudge-nudge jokes, the tiny Barra does not appear to be the only one of Scotlandrsquos scattered Hebridean islands to be experiencing a leap in little people.Despite recent statistics, reported in The Herald on Sunday last week, that suggest the Western Isles are tottering on the brink of a major depopulation crisis almost on a par with the historic Clearances, it seems some islands are facing a dferent kind of problem ndash trying to find enough nursery space to cope.In North Uist, Emily Durie looks out of her kitchen window over her yard where chickens peck and her children happily play towards a glassy sea loch and spectacular sunsets.Her idyllic view is a long way from the hustle and bustle of Manchester where she used to live, and hundreds of miles from her family in the northeast of England.Durie arrived on the island with her architect husband Alex, , in the grip of a March storm just over two years ago to a house theyrsquod never seen before. There was no internet, no phone line and only the warm welcome of their new North Uist neighbours to chase away fears that relocating to a west coast island with a -months-old baby may have been a mistake.Yet, she insists, therersquos no better place to raise Elsie, now three, and her two-year-old brother, Henry.ldquoThere are plenty of children here, says Durie, . A primary school teacher who specialises in outdoor learning, she is helping nursery schools across the Uists increase capacity by introducing outdoor classroom space.ldquoIf all the children across the Uists were to take up their free childcare entitlement, the nurseries wouldnrsquot have the capacity, she points out.Around  miles across the Sea of the Hebrides in Eigg, former music journalist Sarah Boden, , has quit city le for sheep farming and raising son Arlo, four, and -months-old Ness with her musician partner Johnny Lynch, , on the island where she grew up.Two years ago, news of a babyrsquos birth on Eigg made national headlines after its arrival pushed the number of residents over  for the first time in the islandrsquos recent history. Ness was one of three babies born last year and another is due in April while a new family with two children is set to arrive in April.ldquoPart of the attraction is the people here, says Boden. ldquoItrsquos egalitarian, everyone has a similar standard of living which contributes to the community bond.ldquoIn summer therersquos so much going on. People are attracted to Eigg for its music events while in winter itrsquos more community-focused.But there are serious issues that young families have to consider, she warns. For example, the closest secondary schoolrsquos location in Mallaig means children leave Eigg for two weeks at a time to board on the mainland.ldquoThe doctor comes every Tuesday, sothe children have a raging temperature you just have to work around it, she adds. ldquoItrsquos part and parcel of living here.Eiggrsquos population boom is being attributed in part to the  community buyout. ldquoThings are happening now, says Maggie Fyffe, secretary of the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust. The island is a bit more exciting than it used to be and that has attracted young people back.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful place to raise children. People donrsquot have the same kind of lsquostranger dangerrsquo, parents can let their children out the door and not worry.ldquoThe children know everyone and they are never excluded. If therersquos a ceilidh, the children come too.ldquoBut the lack of housing is a big problem.It all sounds buoyant, yet recent statistics have made grim reading.The number of babies born last year at the Western Isles hospital is said to have slumped to  compared to  four years before, and in the past  years, a dozen of the  islands of the Outer Hebrides have become officially uninhabited.Projections suggest a % population decline for Lewis and Harris by , while ndash despite evidence of the baby boom ndash Barra is supposedly braced for a % slide in its numbers.It has been suggested that the Western Islesrsquo overall population will fall from , in  to , by  ndash a projected decline of , people over the -year period.According to Theona Morrison, founder and Director of CoDel, a project which supports enterprise and young people, statistics and birth records suggesting a downward sht across islandsrsquo populations may not always tell the full story.ldquoThe authorities must recognise itrsquos not all one way. There are places like Barra where there has been a real boost in population numbers. Itrsquos worth remembering that not all babies on the islands are born there. Some may be parents ing to the islands with lsquoready-madersquo children that donrsquot appear in the birth statistics.ldquoOthers leave the islands to have their children in hospital in Inverness or Glasgow.ldquoThe pre-school and primary school numbers are what we should be looking at. For example, in North Uist alone therersquos a pre-school mums and tots group that has around  children.ldquoThere have been six sets of twins in the last two years between Benbecula and North Uist.The boost in population was recognised in September in a statement from the Islands Revival, a project supported by the Scottish Government-funded Sefari Responsive Opportunity Initiative and led by the James Hutton Institute and SRUC.Its Islands Revival declaration stated: ldquoWe affirm that there is credible evidence of lsquogreen shootsrsquo of population turnaround in the Scottish islands, which as yet does not show up in official statistics.ldquoThis is illustrated by a number of examples of population growth in islands. It is also indicated by a more positive discourse on population change in island communities.ldquoIt is supported by the changing perceptions of younger, economically active people, especially out-migrant islanders, who increasingly consider their birthplace as a place toto, and at an earlier stage in their lives. Connectivityis playing an important role in popularising this attitude.ldquoIt is important to acknowledge that the demographic aspirations of island communities are not necessarily lsquogrowthrsquo, but rather sustainability, renewal, or restored viability, without risk to social, cultural and environmental assets.The project has also collected its own population statistics which show a % jump in population in West Harris between  and , a doubling in Eiggrsquos numbers since , and growth in Westray in Orkney, Iona and Ulva.Tiny Kerera in the Inner Hebrides, close to Oban, is also said to have doubled in numbers since .Meanwhile, on South Uist, numbers have just been boosted by one ndash although the birth wonrsquot show up on official birth register for the islands.Samantha MacCormick, , recently ed from working in Australia after six years and delivered her lb .oz baby son Darradh in hospital in Glasgow on Thursday.Alongside was her sister Christina Morrison, , who also ed to South Uist after living in Glasgow to raise Finn, three, and one-year-old April with husband Kevin, .ldquoIn Glasgow, we were spending our time working.

HS is one of the biggest players in the Scottish tourism market, with  hostels across Scotland.It accommodates , people a year and has a turnover of pound million, bringing poundm a year the Scottish visitor economy.HS chief executive Margo Paterson admits it was the ldquofunky approach of the designers that led her organisation to Graven, and Hunter says it was his personal memory of, and enthusiasm for, hostelling that convinced him to take on the challenge of upgrading a youth hostel.He now has designs on helping to modernise the rest of the HS estate, talking enthusiastically about designing a special Scottish bunk bed that could be used throughout the HS estate.Both emphasised that the unique nature of hostelling, where travellers get the chance to mix and meet, was key to their thinking.ldquoBecause Edinburgh Central is our flagship hostel and competition is fierce in the capital we wanted to get it right, so we looked to Graven, said Paterson.ldquoTheyrsquore an award-winning Scottish design company ndash what attracted us to them is that they have a great deal of experience in the hospitality world, we are a national hostelling organisation so both ourselves and Graven were really keen to come up with an exciting new design that would really best represent our ongoing modernisation.ldquoTheyrsquore just funky and they have such great ideas.Fascinating archive pictures from Hostelling Scotland and artistsrsquo impressions of the new Edinburgh hostel show how hostelling and hostellers in Scotland have changed over the years.In the s, many hostels were simple wood-clad buildings, such as the well-known Glencoe premises.Riders would use hostels as touring stops, while school groups such Kilmarnock Academy would use them as a holiday base.Warming your knees at the enormous stove was classic entertainment in the s at Crianlarich, and washing facilities at those such as Rowardennan were primitive.Other hostels were in converted big houses, with domestic touches such as fireplaces in the rooms at Oban still evident. But an innovative approach to design has reared its head in the past with the Torridon Hostel built in the s, which still has a touch of mid-century style.The refurbished Glen Nevis hostel has plenty of style, and the new Edinburgh onersquos public areas in the artistsrsquo impressions show the new look of hostels and hostelling.The Edinburgh transformation follows last yearrsquos pound.m upgrade of HSrsquos flagship Glen Nevis hostel, used by thousands each year as a base to climb Ben Nevis and explore the surrounding area.The old wooden building was given a major facelt and an all-new interior, including en-suite bathrooms, twin rooms, giant windows to take advantage of stunning views, and a glossy modern feel. Other hostels are beginning to feel the wind of change, with the barracks-like Inverness hostel getting a smart new lounge and cafe bar area with features such as a water refill station.Hostels modernised recently include Aberdeen, where more private rooms have been installed. There have also been upgrades at Loch Ossian, Achmelvich Beach, Oban and Lochranza on Arran.Ross Hunter, who founded Graven in the s with his partner Janice Kirkpatrick, is delighted to be helping Hostelling Scotland move into a new era.His organisation is better known for designing upmarket interiors at the likes of the Blythswood Square hotel in Glasgow, the VIP lounges at Anfield stadium, and brand and image development at Royal Bank of Scotland premises.Hunter spent many youthful holidays in hostels, starting in  when he paid p a night at the Glen Doll hostel in Angus before walking over Jockrsquos Road to Inverey on Deeside and paying just p to stay there.He said the Edinburgh hostel, a s city-centre office building converted to a hostel in , had become ldquoout of touch with visitorsrsquo expectations: ldquoIt had become a bit institutional looking ndash it might have been a community centre from the s.The challenge was to upgrade it to compete with budget hotels and other cut-price offers for visitors who wanted a more sophisticated city experience, without ruining the communal feel which sets it apart from hotels and Airbnb.He said a cleverly-designed feature dubbed the ldquoGreat Wall of China running along the space managed to unite its dferent uses, while high-end tiles and stone provided the gloss it needed. ldquoIrsquove got fond memories of Scottish hostelling, he said. ldquoA key reason why people stay in hostels is the social experience.ldquoYou meet people who are like-minded ndash whether theyrsquore the same age or not is irrelevant as theyrsquore there because they want the same kind of experience. That opportunity to speak to fellow hostellers is still there and the thing thatrsquos special about hostelling in Scotland is that it provides a really safe environment to have that kind of engagement.The project has fired his imagination. ldquoWe would love the opportunity of extending that kind of thinking into other locations into other hostels too ... we could even design a new Scottish hostel bunk they could use across their estate, he said.HS has been steadily modernising ndash chores for guests were scrapped in the s, alcohol started being sold in , and ldquowardens are now managers ndash but the arrival of Paterson as boss of the organisation accelerated the change, including the new name.Paterson has said HS needs to be in cities, where it has to compete with hotel chains, because that provides surpluses that help pay for upkeep and development of more remote hostels, which the organisation remains deeply committed to.It is also holding true to the ldquoyouth element of the original name, with moves such as the appointment of the first youth trustee, Sophie Bell, . More young trustees are being sought, and a pound, Explorer Fund has been set up to fund trips for youth groups.Paterson added: ldquoWersquoll never be Premier Inn but thatrsquos what our members and guests love about us.The one thing thatrsquos consistent is our welcome and our good customer service but when you go into each hostel therersquos always something a bit dferent."},{"url":null,"title":"pupils-crammed-like-sardines-primary-schools-pushed-limits","story":"Since , hundreds of schools have closed across the country with  fewer schools overall now than there were a decade ago.Dozens of schools, the majority of them primaries, are now having to accommodate more than the maximum number of pupils they were designed for, with some teachers having to use reading rooms, family rooms and Portakabins as routine classroom alternatives.In some cases schools are bulging with up to  per cent more children than they are meant to accommodate, sparking concerns over the impact on their safety and standard of education they receive.Critics have accused the Scottish Government of failing on education and said children are being ldquocrammed in like sardines.Beatrice Wishart, the Liberal Democrats spokeswoman for education, said the data showed that education was not a priority for Nicola Sturgeonrsquos government, and added: \"Its a far cry from fostering an environment thatrsquos conducive to learning.\"While the number of over-capacity secondary schools has reduced in the last  years, from  in  to  in  , the number or primaries schools has risen with  primaries now catering for  per cent or more of the pupils they were designed for, compared with  in .Analysis of the latest education statistics published by the Scottish government show the number of P- children in classes with  or fewer students has also fallen in the last decade.This is despite the Governmentrsquos goal of reducing class sizes for youngsters in the first three years of primary to  pupils or less.In , .% of students in their first three years of education were being taught in classes with up to  pupils, but last year, it was just .% of P- students.In  South Morningside Primary in Edinburgh had one teacher for  P children.Shetland MSP Wishart said: \"Schools across the country are under-resourced and in some cases children are packed in like sardines.ldquoThe number of pupils being taught in super-size classes has soared on the SNPrsquos watch while some buildings simply arenrsquot designed to cope with the numbers of children they are accommodating.ldquoThis is the case in primary schools especially, where some large primary schools are in the region of % over capacity. Itrsquos a far cry from fostering an environment thatrsquos conducive to learning and bigger classes make it harder to close the attainment gap.ldquoEducation is supposed to be the Scottish Governmentrsquos number one priority, but few people believe that any more.\"Teachers union EIS has also raised concerns about over-stretched schools, and said it was \"unacceptable\" that children and teachers were being forced to work in such an environment.They blamed the rising strain on local authority budgets and said childrens education would be impacted.A spokesman for EIS told The Herald on Sunday: \"It is unacceptable for schools to be over capacity as this has signicant implications for the operation of the school, the workload of staff and, crucially, the educational experience of young people.\"It is essential that pupils should be educated in an environment that is conducive to learning, and this may be compromised where too many pupils are being accommodated within a particular school or class.\"Factors such as rising pupil rolls and the strain on education budgets through the climate of austerity have contributed to an environment where some schools can face challenges in accommodating all of the pupils within their catchment area.A spokesman explained some councils do factor in the use of Portakabins as part of the school estate, and therefore they may not look as though their schools had too many pupils when they actually did.When asked specically about Chryston Primary, which is  per cent above capacity according to the latest figures, a spokesman said that there were \"exciting plans\" to replace the school in the next three years but added that Portakabins are being used to accommodate the extra  pupils.He said: \"The current capacity of the school accommodation is  with the current roll sitting at  in August .\"With modular units that are currently in use this increases the capacity to .\"We have exciting plans to construct a new replacement building for Chryston PS within the next three years.\"Kinnaird Primary school in Falkirk has % of the children it is designed to accommodate, according to the government data.

The winds, he recalls, were around  miles an hour andrainwas coming in horizontally.This was the weather the ocean advocate and UN Patron of the Oceans had come to the Outer Hebrides for. It didnrsquot daunt him. Pugh, who was the first man to long-distance swim in all seven oceans, across the North Pole and in a glacial lake on Mount Everest, has known more terrying extremes.ldquoThe wind was so strong it was dficult to close the front door, the -year-old says. ldquoI realised this really was simulating the conditions Irsquom going to find in Antarctica.Rather than swim in the sea, and ldquorisk othersrsquo lives, such as those of the RNLI, he headed with three training companions for a loch on the island, and found what he describes as ldquosome of the most atrocious conditions I have ever experienced.ldquoIt was the type of waters you would only go intoa child was drowning, he says.The environmental campaigner, who has been swimming the worldrsquos oceans for more than three decades, believes the world is in a situation that requires the urgency we might give to a child drowning. Itrsquos that sense of alarm that is driving him to swim across a supraglacial lake in Antarctica on January  ndash a feat he hopes will help persuade governments to create a network of marine protected areasaround Antarctica and tackle climate change. It is what is behind what has been described as his ldquoSpeedo diplomacy.Pughrsquos aim, he says, is about ldquotrying to raise awareness of climate change. But he admits: ldquoWe are so far past that. If you are not aware of climate change yoursquore either an ostrich or an Australian politician.The kilometre swim he is about to do in an Antarctic area which holds the record for the lowest temperatures on Earth ndash and in just his Speedos ndash is all about calling on world leaders to have their own courage.One of the reasons Pugh chose Lewis as his base for training was to send out a political message. ldquoIt was because our futures will be determined in Glasgow, at the COP UN conference on climate change, he says. ldquoAnd I donrsquot say that lightly. We canrsquot kick the can down the road any longer. COP in Madrid was a bitter disappointment. All roads now lead to Glasgow.ldquoThe UK Government is going to have to do some very heavy lting. They must use all their diplomatic effort to ensure all  nations commit to ensuring we take urgent action. We have to do everything we can now to fix the problem. Andwe donrsquot the scenes we are seeing now in Australia are going to be common.He also chose it because the Outer Hebrides offered the right water conditions. ldquoWe felt that these were the very best we could find, which would not be as radical as Antarctica, but would prepare me for Antarctica. We were looking for rough, wild seas and very strong winds. Lewis offered not only seas of C, but lochs at C.These conditions are, of course, in no way as extreme as in Antarctica. ldquoThere the water will be zero degrees, he points out. ldquoThe air temperature will probably be -C. Itrsquos terrying. East Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth.ldquoIrsquom also  now and the science is very clear. The older you get, the less tolerant you get to cold water. But Irsquom so determined to get Antarctica protected. My determination is stronger than the indference of any political leader.Pugh has swum in water that is colder, when, for example, he took on a -metre stretch of the Ross Sea where the water was -.C and the air was -C. He recalls: ldquoYou pull your arm out of water at -.C and itrsquos dropping then to -C so you want to put it back in to warm it back up.His first major sub-zero swim was across the North Pole in . ldquoIn those days, many political leaders were denying what was happening in the Arctic and Irsquod been visiting it for a number of years, he recalls. ldquoIrsquod seen the sea ice melting.The salt water at the North Pole is also -.C. ldquoWater is an interesting substance, he says. ldquoBetween C and C itrsquos a liquid. Below zero itrsquos a solid. There are certain tipping points at which you donrsquot know whatrsquos going to happen, and they have a profound impact on the human body.ldquoI remember standing at the Arctic on the sea ice. Irsquom about about to jump into the water and itrsquos completely black, and Irsquom realising thatthings go wrong now I wonrsquot be alive in a few minutes.He still finds it terrying, even now after all the cold-water swims he has done.In , Pugh swam the -mileof the English Channel in  days. ldquoMy aim was to get the British Government to understand how important it was to protect our waters from industrial fishing, drilling and other processes, he says.Of the waters around the UK, he points out: ldquoOnly seven square kilometres are protected.The swim was unrelenting, says Pugh. ldquoI wanted the Government to commit to protecting % by , and finally, at the end, Michael Gove came down to the beach and the UK Government committed. But I wish they would have done that before I started the swim because it was hard.However, this Antarctic swim will have a dferent intensity. ldquoYou know yoursquore on the edge of le and death, he says.Pugh, who was born in the UK and lives in Cape Town, does what he does in spite of the risk because he has what he describes as ldquopurpose. For him, there was no damascene moment, just a growing awareness built over his career. ldquoThirty-three years is a very long career for a sport, he says. ldquoBut in terms of the le of planet Earth itrsquos but a nanosecond ndash and in that time Irsquove seen massive changes.The biggest changes, he says, have been in the Arctic and the Antarctic. ldquoItrsquos been seeing the melting of the sea ice in the Arctic and also the rise in water temperature. When I did my first swim in the Arctic, in the island of Spitsbergen, the water was C in August. I went back there two years ago. The water was C.Pugh wants not only to highlight this warming, but to negotiate the creation of a network of marine protected areas around Antarctica.The ice breakers. How Scotlands ice swimmers taught me to love the cold.ldquoThe swims take % of my time. Itrsquos the negotiations afterwards which are % of the work. We negotiated an MPA in the Ross Sea in . Itrsquos the biggest protected area in the world, . million square kilometres.ldquoWersquore now trying to build another three. That involves shuttling backwards and forwards to Moscow, to Beijing, other nations. The swim is not over until the MPAs are set up and working. This could be a four-year campaign.He challenges us all to look at what we ourselves are doing. ldquoWe have to ask ourselves one simple question, he says. ldquoWhether you are a government, a business, or a normal person hellip is your response to the climate emergency adequate Talk to Pugh and you get a dferent sense of what a personal adequate response might be. For him, itrsquos taking his own body to its limits, risking death. ldquoI have no desire to die, he says. ldquoI do these swims because I love le, and not just human le, all le. I donrsquot know what  I can do now to draw the worldrsquos attention to what is happening.ldquoIrsquove been swimming with this message for over  years. I donrsquot know what  I can do to shake the lapels of world leaders and get them to understand we have no more time. Time has run out.Pugh extols the pleasures of his Lewis camp. One of these was the unexpected community of swimmers he found there. ldquoWe found a whole community of local swimmers on the Isle of Lewis, which the swimming community in the world didnrsquot know about ndash and they were amazing. Every day it would be myself and Max Holloway, Stacey Holloway [who run guide and coach company WayOutside Ltd] and this guy Colin Macleod.ldquoColin would rope in every local and on some days we would have more people.

Thatrsquos not easy. But I can tell you something ndash itrsquos easy when yoursquove got  locals jumping in with you.On the day of the mph winds, Pugh didnrsquot swim alone. His three training companions jumped into the water with him. ldquoThey all came in with me. And I looked at them as I was doing this, swimming in these atrocious conditions.ldquoI was swallowing a lot of water, so I just did  minutes.

They must remain with the UK parliament, the same way defence must remain, the same way foreign policy must remain.\"It would be wrong for us to give the right to the Scottish Parliament to set the referendums and the context and the timings whenever they wanted for the simple reason that Scotland would then be plunged into neverendums, and thatrsquos not good for us, not good for the economy. ldquoAskedthat was what the Prime Minister would tell Ms Sturgeon this week, Mr Jack said: ldquoNicola Sturgeon has said she fully expects a rebuttal from the Prime Minister to her letter.ldquoMy advice to him is certainly to say that.He went on: ldquoWe have a mandate to say No to a second independence referendum because the Edinburgh Agreement [paving the way for the  referendum] was signed in  by Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond.\"In that agreement it said both parties will uphold the result of the referendum and respect it. They havenrsquot respected the result of the  referendum and they havenrsquot respected the result of the  one.In fact, the Edinburgh Agreement does not include a cast-iron commitment by the Scottish Government to uphold and respect the result, but a more ambiguous aspiration that the result will be fair and clear enough to command respect.The text states the UK and Scottish ldquogovernments are agreed that the referendum shouldhellip deliver a fair test and a decisive expression of the views of people in Scotland and a result that everyone will respect.The governments also ldquolook forward to a referendum that is legal and fair producing a decisive and respected outcome.But the SNP could still argue that, despite those high hopes, respect for the result has proved ephemeral because of Brexit.Mr Jackrsquos ruling out of a Section  order eventhere is another SNP majority at Holyrood is a complete reversal of Mr Jackrsquos position in November.Then, he was askedthe SNP winning most of Scotlandrsquos  seats in the general election would give it a democratic mandate for a Section  order, and replied: ldquoNo.Asked why not, he said: ldquoBecause the democratic mandate for a Section  order is a matter for . Wersquoll see whether or not the Scottish National Party get a majority then.ldquoI mean the Scottish National Party - not in collaboration with other parties, not in any alliances - but a Scottish National Party majority, which is what Ruth Davidson pointed out some months ago.In June last year, Ms Davidson, while still leader of the Scottish Tories, said an outright majority would be needed to begin negotiations on Indyref.She told the BBC: \"If she [Ms Sturgeon] puts it in a [Holyrood] manesto that shes going to hold another referendum and she wins a majority outright, then she can negotiate with theUK government in the same way as happened last time.Asked about his previous comment today, Mr Jack ly claimed he had prefixed it with ldquoRuth Davidson has said.He said: ldquoIn that interview, I made it very clear that it was a once in a letime, once in a generation, vote that we had, and I didnrsquot feel a generation or a letime had passed.ldquoI think we have to take  as a campaign for the Conservatives and the other Unionist parties in Scotland to press hard as they can to press the case for the Union.SNP Shadow Scottish Secretary Mhairi Black said Mr Jackrsquos U-turn was ldquoembarrassing.She said: ldquoThe SNP won a landslide victory in last monthrsquos general election - winning % on a mandate for an independence referendum, while the Tories lost more than half their MPs.ldquoThey stood on a  of stopping Scotlandrsquos right to choose and were humiliated at the polls - the Tories have no mandate whatsoever to block Scottish democracy.ldquoWhatever your views on independence, we can all agree that Scotlandrsquos future must be Scotlandrsquos choice ndash not Boris Johnsonrsquos or his cronies.ldquoScotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and has rejected Brexit at every opportunity. And despite all the bluster from Westminster politicians like Alister Jack, we all know that a fresh referendum on Scotlandrsquos future is in demand."},{"url":null,"title":"POLITICS WATCH  It s the Andrew Marr Show  starring actor James McAvoy","story":"He began yesterdayrsquos show by saying that it looked like ordinary political le had resumed after a frenzied year dealing with Brexit.

People in Orkney will be shocked to hear how often those making emergency calls are being forced to wait due to a lack of land ambulance cover. In many instances, these will be cases where the response time can be critical.“This is absolutely no criticism of Orkney’s ambulance crews, who do outstanding work in operating a service that is clearly over-stretched. Indeed, the admission from the Minister about the scale of the problem shows that local crews are being let down by a lack of resources and support. This can only be making an already dficult job even more challenging.“I am due to meet senior representatives of the Scottish Ambulance Service early next month. I will make clear the need for an urgent review into the resources available locally and calling for additional capacity to meet the needs of the Orkney community. This is the very least that the public and our ambulance staff deserve.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But despite the growing impact of this crisis, there has been little meaningful action from the Scottish Government.“One strand of attracting talented doctors to the region will be ensuring that our medical schools are better linked to our communities.

Nobody ever uses the expression when all is well. When a party is united and focused on winning the prize of power, there is no need. But as soon as cracks start to appear out comes this particular explanation. In recent years, there’s been a lot of broad church chatter from Labour Party MPs. We’ve heard it whenever evidence of disharmony in the party’s Westminster group has emerged. And that has happened frequently.To confuse matters, “broad church” is a multipurpose platitude. Those Labour MPs loyal to departing leader Jeremy Corbyn use to it to paper over ision while those who believe the party must move back to the centre ground cite it as an aspiration.“We are a broad church,” insists the Corbynista. “We must become a broad church,” demands the Labour moderate.The truth is that, under Corbyn’s leadership, Labour became a very narrow church indeed. The hard left seized control of the party machine and only those devoted to the cult of Jeremy were considered sound.But the Corbyn era now draws to a close. The current leadership election presents the Labour Party with an opportunity to reposition itself in the political marketplace.In the aftermath of Labour’s humiliating general election defeat in December, it seemed that the contest to replace the new leader would not lead to substantial change in the way the party does its politics. The Corbynista MP, Rebecca Long-Bailey, was widely regarded as an unstoppable candidate who would maintain the positions adopted by the current leader.Now, it seems Long Bailey’s victory is far from assured. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer is the current front-runner in the leadership contest and,he can see this thing through, he will have the opportunity to make real changes in a party currently infected with the disease of ideological purity.In recent years, we have seen far greater public engagement with politics than ever before. Social media has given s to those who would have struggled to have their voices heard and, in some instances, party memberships have soared.This has meant, particularly for the SNP and Labour, healthier finances and huge activist bases on which to depend during campaigns.But the downside for these political parties of greater public engagement with politics has been greater public engagement with politics. Members might be the leblood of political parties but they also, inconveniently, expect to have a say in how things are done.For SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, this has meant juggling the desire of the majority of her members for another independence referendum with the reality that she has neither the power to hold one nor the support to win it.Sturgeon has, so far, survived by perpetually leading the troops to the top of the hill. One last heave and we’re there, she says. The nationalists, however, have not yet reached the summit.Corbyn’s successor will inherit an even larger membership than the SNP’s and these people will have expectations. Given that the majority of these members are enthusiastic supporters of the man who has just led the party to its worst defeat in living memory, the next Labour leader may be tempted to give those members what they want.This would be a mistake on a par with the decision of the members to elect Corbyn leader in the first place.If Starmer can stay ahead of Long-Bailey and wrestle the Labour Party back from the hard left, then his first act as leader must be to make clear that the Corbyn era is firmly over and that those who do not like this are welcome to leave.Political activists are a curious bunch. They assume a great deal about the voting public, not least that they are as engaged with the debate as they are.This delusion leads SNP activists to believe most Scots share their view that the failure of the UK government to grant the First Minister the power to call a second independence referendum represents an abuse of democracy.As we have seen recently, this delusion has led very many Labour supporters to believe that a UK public that rejects Labour wouldto the partyonly it was more left-wing.Starmer – or whoever succeeds Corbyn – must ignore the demands of members who want to maintain the party’s purity.Sturgeon is a master at this. She manages to retain the loyalty of members while clearly and repeatedly failing to give them what they wantThe challenge for the next Labour leader will be greater. Not only will they want to keep membership numbers healthy, they will have to convince the voting public that the party has changed and that there will be no going back to the politics of Corbyn.This will require a fair degree of brutality. The exile of Corbyn favourites such as Richard Burgon and, yes, even Long-Bailey herself, to the back benches would be a good start.It would also helpLabour MPs would stop enthusiastically criticising the Blair and Brown years. On the day in  that Corbyn and Tom Watson were elected leader and deputy leader of the party, Corbyn is said to have told his second in command “We’re got our party back”.The next leader should feel the same way when they watch Corbyn shuffle off to the obscurity from whence he came.I have no doubt that whoever wins the Labour leadership election will have much to say about the party being a broad church. We have room, they will say, for people from many traditions, from the left to the centre.But, in reality, Labour will continue to failthe party doesn’t become narrower, with the hard left cut adrt.Voters have twice looked at Corbyn’s broad church and then decided to congregate where.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"how tories can win back scots who don t like boris brexit or both john mclellan","story":"Tories must learn from last month#s general election victory and the  disaster and focus on developing a winning strategy for next year#s Holyrood elections, rather than detailed policies which can turn into electoral poison, writes John McLellan.In a mood of mischief, I momentarily considered trying to test the Labour Party’s membership system to see whether I could get a vote in the leadership contest, but as Corbynism looks here to stay and it’s impossible to tell who is the worst candidate I quickly concluded there wasn’t any point.In any case, we’re not short of leadership campaigns in the Conservative Party and the process of finding a new Scottish boss is now likely to be a two-horse race between interim leader Jackson Carlaw and his Scottish Parliament colleague Michelle Ballantyne, the former Conservative group leader on Borders Council.Holyrood veteran Mr Carlaw is by some way the favourite, having led the party for the past six months, enjoyed a high TV profile in the General Election and visited the party associations during the campaign. But even before the election was called, Ms Ballantyne was getting around association meetings to raise her profile beyond the Borders in anticipation of a contest sooner or later. Her strong promise to the grassroots of more say to local associations has attracted plenty of support, including some of my Edinburgh Council colleagues, so a good contest is pretty much guaranteed.: The Conservatives have abandoned true conservatism for nationalism – Paris Gourtsoyannis: Alister Jack said he would fund breakaway Scottish Conservative PartyOf course, it’s all very well winning the contest, it’s what happens afterwards that matters and there is a very small window for the winner to settle in and produce a strategy that gives the party a realistic chance of overtaking the SNP as the biggest single party at the  Scottish elections. By the time the result is announced on February , there will be barely  months to go so realistically around seven months to prepare and agree a campaign.That process has been complicated by this week’s departure of strategy and communications chief Eddie Barnes, who planned to go shortly after Ruth Davidson’s decision to step down but agreed to stay on for the election campaign. The gap he leaves is not the only one from Ruth Davidson’s  high-point, with the previous departures of policy chief Marek Zemanic and the closest the Scottish Conservatives had to the left-field thinking power of Dominic Cummings, Kevin Ancell. So the new leader’s top priority is to assemble his or her version of that team, able to work effectively with whatever comes out of Mr Cummings’ Downing Street “weirdos and misfits” shake-up. Scottish party director Lord Mark McInnes and chairman Rab Forman have vital roles to play and both understand the political reality that the minute the contest is over the focus must be on the wider electorate, not party structures. Partly for this reason, it was accepted that turning Ruth Davidson’s succession into an argument about the Scottish party’s relationship with London would be disastrous. The membership is certainly anxious to be talking about new Conservative policies for the  campaign, an attractive, viable alternative programme for government, and for the  campaign not to rely solely on opposition to a second independence referendum.But the key lesson from the  triumph was the simplicity of the message and that campaign had learnt from the  disaster what look like detailed, credible and honest policies on paper can easily become electoral poison.There is more than enough in the SNP’s  years of government to attack without giving Nationalists the means to deflect criticism.We know from the  campaign in Scotland that those Conservatives who turned away did so because they didn’t like Boris Johnson or Brexit or both, but in a dferent context would . The context in  will indeed be dferent Brexit will be done and, like it or not, the election will be about a second independence referendum first and foremost, then the SNP’s record.Cynical though it may seem, details of what the new leader would like to dohe or she is First Minister come after understanding what it will take to win. And sticking to it.Downing Street’s pointless fight with Scottish PressAt a time of unprecedented political change and the perpetual turmoil of the digital communications revolution, the desire of the new UK Government to “slaughter sacred cows” is recognition that so many of the old ways of doing things are no longer suitable. In looking for places to start, Downing Street has chosen what it probably regarded as a soft target by switching the twice-daily official briefings for the Westminster Lobby correspondents from their offices above the Commons to  Downing Street.It’s not dficult to see why this wasn’t thought to be much of a problem because the list of registered Lobby journalists is dominated by heavy representation from the big news organisations  from the BBC alone,  from the , The Sun eight and even the weekly Spectator magazine lists three.Beyond Fleet Street, the Scottish Press is the best-represented group, with staff from this paper, the Herald, Daily Record, The Courier and the Aberdeen Press  Journal, but with only the one from each they will have to dash from the Commons to Downing Street, get through the security gate and into Number  and then the same in reverse to catch whatever business is going on in the House.It’s a needless inconvenience and a reasonable compromise of having the morning brief in Downing Street but the afternoon session kept in the Lobby has been mooted. With the Scottish election looming and a new Scottish leader to bed in, whatever holy cattle are headed for the abattoir, Downing Street shouldn’t pick pointless fights with the Scottish Press.Free trade or holidays Much of Scotland’s global reputation for being lovers of hard drink is based not just on the whisky business but on the bacchanalian revelry which surrounds Hogmanay, to the extent that two bank holidays are needed for the hangover while the rest of the UK gets by with one.But for the newspaper business, January  is a normal publishing day, bringing readers news of the celebrations, the New Year babies, previews of sports fixtures and such like and in the internet age that won’t change.But now it seems First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is set to back a campaign by the shop workers union Usdaw to ban bigger shops from opening on Ne’er Day which would all but wipe out hard copy sales which remain vital to an industry already under severe financial pressures.Labour MSP Jackie Baillie says it’s to allow retail staff to spend more time with their families, but it’s just another excuse for government to interfere with free trade.John McLellan is a Conservative councillor in Edinburgh©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"wanted remote scottish island seeks manager to bring in tourists to forgotten isle","story":"A tiny Scottish island with a population of six people is advertising for a manager to draw in more tourists.The community owned island of Ulva in the Inner Hebrides is looking for a project manager to develop a heritage visitor centre at the former Lairds house, Ulva House.The North West Mull Community Woodland Company Ltd, which owns Ulva, is advertising the job which pays between £, and £,.: The faces of some of Edinburgh’s earliest inhabitants revealedThe job ad states: \"The objectives of the acquisition are to manage the island to provide sustainable benefits with a focus on repopulation and ensuring community ownership delivers benefits for the wider North West Mull area as well as the island itself.\"Since coming into community ownership work has been progressing on several key projects, one of which is the refurbishment and repurposing of the former Lairds House, Ulva House, as a heritage visitor centre with associated self-catering accommodation.\"To this end the company are seeking to appoint an ambitious and experienced project manager.\"More than  people expressed an interest in living on Ulva last year after being bought by islanders who secured up to £. million in funds from the Scottish Land Fund.If all were selected to become islanders it would represent around a , per cent rise in the existing population on the ,-acre island.: Ask the historians: Who was the cruellest figure in Scottish history The job advert adds: \"Ulvas people have inspiring and engaging stories to tell, including that of Lachlan Macquarie - the Founding Father of modern Australia.\"He achieved great success and his influence lives on and is celebrated today.\"However of the thousands of other people who left Ulva, voluntarily or forced, there are other stories of the famous, infamous and not famous - that deserve to be told.\"The focus of the project will be telling the stories of six or so key Ulva iniduals.\"Who they were, set in the context of their times, the impact they had on Ulva and, as they left, the impact they had on the place they went to.\"There are some obvious stories - such as Lachlan Macquarie and one of the Clarks - the Clearance lairds.\"However there will be others, discovered through research, that will tell the story of their time - what it was like to live on Ulva and like to leave Ulva.\"Initial research has already identied a number of interesting characters that need to be explored further.\"The closing date for applications is January  and the job is from March to November .©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"i m no blairite says labour deputy leadership hopeful ian murray","story":"Ian Murray#s Westminster political career has been a series of lonely, thankless battles.Elected in , he held on to his seat for Labour after the retirement of the incumbent, when his party was going backwards and Edinburgh South was the number one Liberal Democrat target.He was one of the earliest movers on the Labour benches pushing the party to back a second referendum on EU membership. And he’s survived two historic SNP landslides that have left him the sole Labour MP in Scotland.Now Murray is taking on the anointed candidate of the left for the deputy leadership, trying to remind the UK Labour Party that Scotland exists.He’s never had to speak about himself much, but he has tohe wants to overcome the legacy of another lonely battle: Murray was among the strongest and earliest critics of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership one of the first to quit the shadow cabinet in .He’s asking for votes from a party dominated by Corbyn supporters who have little sense of him, beyond what they see as disloyalty.“People have preconceived ideas about my politics that aren’t actually true,” Murray says when we sit down in his office, on an upper floor of Portcullis House.There aren’t many artworks on the walls or knick-knacks on the shelves - although he does have a framed political cartoon showing a workman dismantling a Westminster statue of a prime minister, as he shouts: “Don’t move that head yet! Party still can’t find one to replace it.”Murray grew up in the Wester Hailes neighbourhood of Edinburgh, among some of Scotland’s most deprived housing estates.“Mother, father, two kids, grandparents lived a mile on either side, and on the square that we lived in on Dumbryden Gardens, we had two cousins across the road,” he says. “Our best mates that we still go to the football with lived in the top floor of another flat.“We used to all play together in the square. The primary school, Dumbryden Primary School, was just across the bridge behind it.”His father and uncle worked in what is now the Whyte  Mackay whisky distillery, starting out as coopers. Murray’s mum was mainly at home looking after him and his brother, doing the odd bit of part time work, like cleaning at a Woolworths. But then his father died at the age of , when Murray was nine and his brother .“She did a kitchen job in a pub. She worked in a pub called the Busy Bee in Saughton which was next to her parents. It was a pretty rough pub, but nobody got on the wrong side of her.”Later, he went to the Wester Hailes Education Centre, which still has one of the lowest attainment rates in Scotland. Murray says he “loved it” and would have been a teacherhe hadn’t gone into politics, but he went to university at just  “because school didn’t have much left for me to do”.Like much of the time, there’s a wink in Murray’s voice as he adds: “I didn’t drink, honest.”Murray was part of the University of Edinburgh’s Lothian Equal Access Programme for Schools, which works to get pupils from the most deprived areas around the Scottish capital into one of the UK’s most prestigious ancient universities.“That’s why I’m quite passionate about university entry stuff,” he says. Murray was part of a summer programme that brings teenagers on to the university campus to show them what le as a student is like, and he won an offer from Edinburgh conditional on getting five marks at higher level, two of which had to be As.“I was OK in four subjects that I did, but I was doing music at a higher level for the first time, and I hadn’t done music at standard grade level. And I was doing drums and piano. The music teacher saidyou want to get into Edinburgh University at the end of fth year, you’re going to have to do something other than play the drums, because you’re hopeless.“I said, what other instrument can I do  She went, you can’t learn another instrument to that kind of level between now and then. You’re going to have to sing.“So I sang my way into uni really.”Murray concludes: “People go, ‘well, you know, you’re just a right-wing Blairite.’ And you go, well actually no, that upbringing was… the word tough is the wrong word to use, but it was as working class as any other person who’s on that deputy leadership slate.”Football, pubs and politics have dominated Murray’s le. There was a bookmakers next to the Busy Bee, and his mother was also an independent bookie, taking her chalkboard to Musselburgh Racecourse. “You tell her the odds of something and she’ll work it out for you.” Murray was instrumental in the fan bailout of his beloved Heart of Midlothian FC, as chairman of the supporters’ trust.Before being elected to parliament, Murray had a business running pubs and bars. His uncle, who became a “pseudo father”, would take him on the long walk across Edinburgh to Musselburgh. Murray remembers the route he took as a ten and  year-old the name of the pubs along the way. “He’d go in and I would stand outside.”Rather than Tony Blair or Gordon Brown, who Murray describes as a “titan of politics”, his personal hero is John Smith.“We were brought up in my family to boo at the TV every time Thatcher came on,” Murray says. “And Ken Clarke because he was the Chancellor, and Malcolm Rkind, who was the local MP. When I told my mum at her th birthday party that I had lunch with Ken Clarke to talk about how we stop Brexit, she was furious.”Murray rejects the suggestion that he is the “centrist candidate” against Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary and a loyal Corbyn lieutenant throughout. He says he would serve as shadow Scottish Secretary – a position he has been locked out of under Corbyn – for any of the leadership candidates.Murray defends much of the  manesto, particularly on rail renationalisation and the call for a Green Industrial Revolution, but says it went “too far” in some places. A promise of free broadband internet was greeted on the doorsteps as “interesting but barking mad”, says Murray, and argues that the industry and public would have welcomed a voucher system that achieved the same aim without committing Labour to another big renationalisation.“I thinkyou look at Angela Rayner’s politics and mine, there’s probably a cigarette paper between us on most of the value-driven stuff,” he says.“I think the dference is – and I don’t think it’s unkind to say this – I was outside the tent, trying to reflect what people were saying to me, and she was inside the tent trying to reflect what was inside the tent to the public.“I always said to people in the Shadow Cabinet and to Jeremy himself that he had to change course, because that’s what the public were telling us. Andhe didn’t, the public would have their say. And the public had their say on  December.”Murray adds: “You’ve got two things you can do in politics. You can either listen to the public… or you can stick to your political purity and lose the public. And I’d rather be in government than in opposition.”Having built a coalition in his own seat that has kept the SNP at bay, Murray’s pitch to the party is that he knows how to craft a message that is patriotic while also being pro-Union, pro-Europe and true to left-wing values, and can see off a tide of post-Brexit nationalism.But he looks at risk of losing the argument at home, where the Scottish Labour party is ready to open the door to a second independence referendum – and perhaps in the UK party, too.Clive Lewis, an outsider to make it on to the Labour leadership ballot, told the National newspaper this week that Scottish Labour should back indyref and its members free to campaign for independence, and even Sir Keir Starmer, who Murray is advising on Scottish issues along with Jess Phillips, appears open to allowing a referendumthere is a pro-independence majority after the  Holyrood elections.“I wouldn’t say that UK political parties have forgotten Scotland. I’d say that UK political parties to a certain extent don’t fully understand it,” Murray says.“I wouldn’t go to a national newspaper in the southeast of England and say ‘I’m sorry, but I disagree that Norwich’s High Street should be pedestrianised.’ I mean, why would I  I know nothing about it. I’d be sticking my nose into something that I don’t really need to stick my nose into, and I’d be talking shit.”Murray says embracing indyref is a mistake for Labour, which “cannot be pandering to stuff that we don’t believe in for the sake of getting more votes”.“Let the SNP put on the front page of a manesto, ‘give us a mandate for a second independence referendum’ at the  Scottish elections and let’s see what the electorate say,” he argues.“I will be saying, ‘Look, by the time that  comes along, we’ll have had  years of SNP government in Scotland. Everything has got worse, by every single measure: child poverty, NHS, education, transport, justice, economy, employment, hope and aspiration for the future, house building…’“They’ve spent the last  years managing decline and what they’re asking you to do is to give them an independent country so they can trash that as well.

Though not the primary escape route, they are still an escape route in an emergency.“It’s a bit alarming to know that should there be an emergency, escape would’ve been delayed because of locked exits, and, depending on the emergency, could pose a real risk.”The Rail, Maritime and Transport union , which represents most Sleeper staff, said it had been informed.A spokesperson said: “RMT is fully aware of the problem and its serious nature. We are consulting with our reps on the Sleeper over both a solution and any further action required to ensure safe operation.”The Office of Rail and Road, which regulates safety, said: “Normally in an emergency situation, the safest place is inside the train, as the vehicle is designed to protect the passengers.“Should evacuation be necessary, the primary route is via the doors.“In an extreme situation, such as the vehicle being on its side, windows can be used.“Normally, windows are secured but not locked, and have sensors to noty the train managerthey are open.“On rare occasions, a  signal may be sent and the train manager is required to assesses the situation and may need to lock the window.“Windows are secured to prevent an open window fouling the path of trains on adjacent lines.”Ryan Flaherty, Serco’s managing director for Caledonian Sleeper said: “Clear processes and standards exists to assess and manage any risks so the safety of our guests and staff is not compromised.“The emergency windows have been designed, approved and risk assessed andthere is a fault with a window they can be locked until the problem is resolved.“As you would expect, guest and staff safety is always our number one priority and the new Caledonian Sleeper fleet is fully compliant with all mandated safety standards.

Chairman, Billy McIlroy, said it was “very pleasing” to see so many swimmers including young people on the events th year.Mementoes and certicates were presented by Mrs Sharon Smyth and Mrs Ann Ryan to the swimmers who had taken part on the day with all the swimmers being warmly applauded.After the presentations the Chairman again paid tribute to those who sponsored the swimmers this year as they have done for many years in the past.

The -year-old contract, which secured the services of Downpatrick footballer Jimmy Connor, is now the oldest artefact in the society’s museum.Signed on July , the document was for a season-long spell from September  of that year until April  in . However, Connor was also part of Belfast Celtic’s first league winning side of the - season.His highly decorated career would see him win virtually every trophy in Irish football, including a further league title with Glentoran and the inaugural Gold Cup in .The Belfast Celtic Society received the artefact from an anonymous donor, who found it in a pub in County Down.Speaking about the find, the society’s Chairman, Pádraig Coyle, said: “It means a huge amount to us.“The donor, when they did a bit of research and saw who this man was, they got in touch with the Society and askedwe would be interested in having them in the museum and of course we were delighted and very pleased that they are there. “It’s just another bit in the jigsaw of the story that is Belfast Celtic.”Signed by Belfast Celtic Secretary Robert Barr, the deal saw Connor receive a £ signing-on fee and  shillings per week. Mr Coyle said the fairly lucrative contract offers an insight into how well the club treated its players.“He was paid a fair wage then, and it’s interesting when you look at the document and see that when they were injured they still got paid provided they showed a doctor’s certicate,” he said,“It’s another reflection of how Belfast Celtic tried to look after its players in those days. Bear in mind that there wasn’t social security back then, there weren’t employers insurance arrangements, so it would’ve meant a lot to the guy thathe was hurt that his employers would look after him. I’m not surethat was common practice, but that’s how he was treated by Belfast Celtic.”Connor was seen as a particularly tough player, who would walk from Downpatrick to Belfast for training sessions, but for all his physical prowess and skill he was, given the time, relatively uneducated and simply signed his contract with an ‘X’.“It’s absolutely no reflection on him that maybe he wasn’t able to read or write, but how many people back then would’ve had access to education in the way that we do so now,” Mr Coyle explained.“What became the  Plus Act, the Education Act, wasn’t introduced until , so for many people having a basic education just wasn’t as easy,you lived in a rural area it was much more dficult.“I hadn’t seen a contract signed with an ‘X’ before I saw his contract. Of course, this was  years ago.”While the contract offers a fascinating insight into Belfast Celtic as a club, Mr Coyle said it contributes to the wider history of the city, particularly around St James’ and the Park Centre site where Celtic Park once sat.“It all helps to tell the story of that part of the city because at the time Jimmy Connor was playing for them they were the star attraction in that part of the area. People’s lives revolved around seeing Belfast Celtic midweek and on a Saturday. “The man who would’ve signed Jimmy Connor, his name is at the top of the contract, Robert Barr – he was a school teacher and he gave that up to become full-time secretary of Belfast Celtic Football Club. He worked for them until his death. There is a story there too. You’ll know St James’ and there’s a roadthat leads to Willowbank’s playing pitch and my surmising of it is that he lived in a house back in the day when there wouldn’t have been that road there, but he lived in a house, from what I’ve been told, that led into the Belfast Celtic ground. The story goes that he went out his back door in the morning, down that back garden and out a gate straight into Celtic Park.He added: “He would’ve been the guy who did all the administration for people like Jimmy Connor, who maybe couldn’t read or write, but he looked after them and made sure they were treated properly.”During his career Jimmy Connor was picked as an Irish international, receiving  caps during a -year spell when he played alongside other stars such as Mickey Hamill and Patrick O’Connell who, during a his managerial career, would save Catalan giants FC Barcelona from certain collapse.Sadly, Jimmy Connor’s le was cut short when he died in the Spanish Flu pandemic of , aged just .It is not knownJimmy Connor is survived by any family members, but Mr Coyle encouraged anyone with any information about him or Belfast Celtic to help keep the history alive by getting in touch.“Those of us associated with the Society are just volunteers who love the story and we’re happy in any way to help promote the story,” he enthused.“If people have anything they want to let us see or talk about then we’re more than willing.Anything at all to keep the story of the incredible football club going.”Jimmy Connor’s contract will go on display at the Belfast Celtic Society museum in the Park Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"orange order says no to new decade new approach deal","story":"ORANGE Order leaders have fired a shot across the DUP bows with a no-holds-barred attack on the #New Decade, New Approach# deal tabled last night by the Irish and British governments.Previously, Order Grand Secretary Mervyn Gibson had warned the DUP that any concession on an Irish Language Act would be fiercely opposed by Orangemen.#In contrast to the detailed list of measures to promote the Irish language, references to Ulster-Scots Ulster-British culture are ambiguous # lacking meaningful detail or delivery mechanisms,# said a statement from the Grand Lodge of Ireland. #Indeed, many of the initiatives are merely reworking of previous undelivered commitments to our community. As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

That said, there is some laudable text introducing greater precision over how PoCs are deployed and at which stages of the legislative process.Meanwhile, the  Stormont House Agreement dealing with legacy and other issues is to be delivered \"within  days\" - a mere six years late.New  There is some serious money involved in the package. The economic aspects are the most positive.Substantial cash is attached, more even than that netted by the DUP in its  confidence-and-supply deal. This money will offer positive benefits to many peoples lives, via improved mental health provision, a pay settlement for nurses - and  more of them and three courses of IVF treatment. The infrastructure financial promises to Derry, especially, are potentially transformative.On Brexit, there will be a dedicated committee and a promise that a restored Northern Ireland Executive will be consulted - but anyone thinking that this say will be crucial should ask the devolved administrations how they regard the effectiveness of the Joint Ministerial Council, particularly on EU matters. The replies will be less than complimentary.The deal promises legislation to ensure the seamlessness of NI-GB trade but its the GB-NI direction that is more problematic given what the EU deal states.Neither the UK nor a restored devolved government can wish away Protocol text which requires goods heading from GB to NI to be treated as potential entrants to the EU Single Market - requiring checks and declaration which do impair the UK single market.Borrowed  There are long-overdue rules on ministerial accountability and a laudable bolstering of an official Opposition, finally imported from most western democracies. For any party, there is the option of entering an official opposition with much greater recognition than the embryo which emerged in the dying years of the previous Assembly. Useful ideas on civic engagement, increasingly evident in other political systems, have also been incorporated.Red, white and blue  The Union flag can be hoisted on public buildings for an extra few days. But presumably not for the Sussexes.On a bad day for Stormont cobwebs, the British and Irish governments must be pleased with their work.Dealing with Northern Ireland must seem a breeze for the Dublin administration, compared to organising RIC commemorations.The DUP was first out of the blocks to hail the plan as the basis for a deal. That basis is far more the changed political context than the deals novelty. A Stormontseemed certain the moment the exit poll appeared on our TV screens on December . What was unsellable internally within the DUP on language amid Westminster glories in  is now a case of needs-must. Without Stormont, the DUP - and everyone  - faces a generation of powerlessness. Its a bleak vista none of the parties wished to contemplate.So, will it be fun to stay with the NDNA  In the short-term yes but the deal needs to endure for years for Stormont to restore its credibility.

I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

There are pressures all around us stretching our capacity for goodwill, people and events demanding we seek the perfect in an imperfect world. But, it is the pragmatists who continue to survive while the competition withers away.The New Decade, New Approach released by the British and Irish governments on Thursday evening should be and has been welcomed by the business community. We understand the need for the compromises it contains. Ultimately we understand the urgent need to get this devolution show back on the road.From an NI economy point of view there are of course many gaps in the document which we could choose to concentrate on, but there are also really signicant commitments and promises of investment. We cant, wont and shouldnt get all that we want.However, it is clear that the contribution of the business community in the past  months in particular has been registered by the two Governments and hopefully our local parties.As evidence, after PM Boris Johnson did a rollover and agreed a Withdrawal Agreement with the EU in October, the business community came together and presented a large body of ideas, interventions and investments to protect, repurpose and regenerate the NI economy post-Brexit. Much of these are committed to in the New Decade, New Approach proposals.Again, this past week we worked and got agreement from all our local MPs on amendments to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. Not surprisingly, given the Tory majority in Parliament, these amendments were rejected as the Government wish to have a clean passage of the Bill to get Brexit done.However, again, the requirements of these Amendments are in the deal presented to local parties on Thursday evening. The crisis in our health system, the stresses in education are well understood by the public. For those two areas alone, it is worth the local parties allowing pragmatism to overrule their desire for the perfect deal.A collective NI Executive voice was sadly absent from the Brexit debate this past couple of years. With Boris deal now done,  is a critical year where how we trade with Great Britain for the next generation will be defined. We really need our local politicians back and batting for us.And it will take civic society to play our part in creating and protecting the space which allows any new Executive to get going quickly. As we did with the Brexit debate, we are prepared to offer our insight, expertise and effort to help.\"New Decade, New Approach\" is not perfect, but there is much to be admired. There is much to get us going, again. For us, there is enough. Lets get it done.Stephen Kelly is chief executive, Manufacturing NI"},{"url":null,"title":"storm brendan set to batter island of ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is not about apportioning blame, it’s about establishing the truth and I think we are going to try and move forward now.“The British Government has committed to move forward on the basis of the Stormont House Agreement in thisagreement and I think that is going to be a big challenge for Julian Smith, as a Secretary of State, to explain in Westminster but also to convince people in Northern Ireland who want him to move ahead with this process, but to do it in a way that is fair and truthful.“And I think we can do that and certainly the Irish Government is there to help and to work with communities to bring them on that dficult journey.“But that is a journey that is essentialwe are going to achieve true reconciliation in Northern Ireland which is ultimately what we need to do.”Mr Coveney also downplayed the influence of the UK general election result on achieving the breakthrough that secured theof Stormont.Some have claimed the DUP losing its status as Westminster kingmaker changed the dynamic in the talks, and ultimately led to the party being more willing to sign up to proposals that it had previously rejected.Certainly the British general election has been part of that story, but I wouldn’t characterise it as the dominant influence over what has been achieved this weekendSimon CoveneyIreland’s foreign affairs minister said the agreement did not come about because of the election.“That hasn’t just happened because of a British general election and the changing balance of the power that has involved the DUP in the past,” he said.“I have been working with all parties in Northern Ireland for two years.

Its strategic plan centres around funding for the Greater Belfast Development with no mention of its Magee or Coleraine campuses which have witnessed student numbers drop signicantly in the past five years. The University’s most recent Financial Statement for  , outlines its long-term financial strategy. UU’s five-year strategic plan ‘Five and Fty’ sets the vision and mission of the University. It states: “As Northern Ireland’s civic university, Ulster University will deliver outstanding research and teaching that encourages the innovation, leadership and vision needed to help our community thrive.” googletag.cmd.push It details ambitions to deliver an “operating surplus” to support a sustainable investment strategy in both the University’s physical resources and information technology facilities. This includes the generation of “sufficient cash reserves” to allow for the allocation of poundm per annum to capital projects of which poundm per annum is towards the Greater Belfast Development and the repayment of loans to fund this project. A spokesperson for the Derry University Group has urged UU to immediately hand over its lands to city-region, saying: UU is demonstrating all the hallmarks of a struggling multi-national business running down a neglected outpost. Ulster needs to hand over the lands and budgets at Magee to the city-region immediately to allow us to develop university provision here autonomously. Ultimately, we can sit and watch UU die slowly in the regions while it moves to Belfast, or we can take proper control of the situation ourselves and start building for the future, with a vengeance. googletag.cmd.push The idea of Council partnering in a multi-million pounds development City Deal with organisation such as UU is frankly ludicrous. Imagine you were about to invest poundm and performed due diligence on your partners and found out they had UUs record. You would leave the table immediately. Council must do likewise. Signicant problems The University’s approved financial strategy aimed to ensure the financial viability of UU. Any borrowings were not to exceed that approved in the Business Plan for the Greater Belfast Development and any other projects that may arise which are confirmed as self-funding. The strategy also aimed to support the development of activities that generate income for growth. However, since the   financial statement was published the Northern Ireland Audit Office released a report showing that the Greater Belfast Development has encountered signicant problems, and delays, meaning it now needs to attract substantial additional external finance to bridge a major funding gap. It is anticipated to run poundm over budget. The business case, approved in March , envisaged that the expanded Belfast Campus would be open to students in September  at a cost of pound million. Funding was to come mainly from the UU’s own reserves and external borrowing, with the Department for the Economycontributing poundm capital grant. UU has earmarked cash reserves of poundm built up since , to support the project and committed a further pound million over the next three years. This is over and above the pound.m spent by UU to date. The total cost of the project is now estimated at pound.m including  per cent VAT which is irrecoverable.

This information can now be easily recorded through the elicence website.John McCartney, director of conservation and protection, said: “This is really important information because it enables our scientists to understand how many fish are caught, taken or ed back to the river and how much time anglers put into catching those fish.“ It provides an indication of how well stocks are doing andwe need to take any action should catches take a turn for the worst.”Freshwater fishery biologist, Mark McCauley, said the Loughs Agency used anglers logs s to manage the fisheries of Foyle. He added: “We use the data to screen proposed developments such as roads, hydro, etc that may impact the interests of the fishery.“We can also use the data anglers provide to assess the strength of fish runs in the system this year and also for long term trend monitoring.”Have you purchased a Loughs Agency licence this year  Log in with your angler number at https:elicence.loughs-agency.org and update your angling log for the  season. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The result is Belfast: City of Light, a new book in which she shares her experiences and asks some pertinent questions on matters of faith and beliefs.Bronagh began her journey as a non-churchgoer. Now, she says she is a dferent person.ldquoI did not set out to go on this journey or write this book, but simply started to follow an artistic thread like many artists over the centuries before me, she remarked. ldquoThe thread became so compelling and extraordinary that I eventually felt destined to write it down.Born in Newtownards in  to Frances and Paddy Lawson, who had ed to Belfast to oversee the design and building of the Ulster Museum, Bronagh spent her first two years on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast with her three older sisters, before moving to Portaferry in  and later to Strangford.Educated at Down High School, in  she attended art college in Bristol and then gained a first class degree in textiles fashion at Winchester School of Art, Hampshire. Moving to London on graduation, she won a Fulbright scholarship and attended Parsons School of Design in New York.Bronagh sometimes visited Northern Ireland and despaired. Prior to the end of the Troubles she spent time as a participant on ious cross-community development programmes before deciding to use her creativity in a dferent way.For  years she set up and ran cross-border, cross-community development programmes mostly within the enterprise sector in interfaceareas of Belfast. At the same time she explored her own upbringing during the Troubles and heard many stories from people in Belfast of experience she only saw on TV growing up and often switched off in horror.She spent three years based in North Belfast, between the republican New Lodge and loyalist Tigers Bay areas. Walking into work one day she collapsed. She had become incapable of processing the traumas that people living in some of most deprived areas of Europe were enduring on a daily basis.She found herself coming back to her original training as an artist and started a journey towards her own healing by going to church.Bronagh says she asked herself a lot of questions as she attended Protestant and Catholic services in Belfast and beyond.She says: ldquoWhatinstead of listening to the continuous repeated stories of Protestant vs Catholic in Belfast, an inidual had first-hand experience of visiting every church in the city for a service, simply looking and listening when going to each one ldquoWhat would they see and hear  As a non-church goer starting out on this journey, how would you feel ten years later  What is going on in churches in contemporary Belfast  How might this open-minded curiosity inform the continuous shting conversation about the city that I call home Belfast: City of Light costs pound and is available online at lulu.

I am guided by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie also recalled the words of the very early th century Irish political thinker, AE Russell, who said: ldquoThe strength of Irish culture lies, I believe, in plurality rather than unormity.The view that national culture is a guarantor of homogeneous identity is no longer tenable. A living culture follows a multiplicity of voices. Authentic culture is not a matter of ourselves alone. Baroness Ritchie said that running alongside the Good Friday Agreement, Russellrsquos words are the embodiment of her political philosophy mdash partnership, working together, respect for political and ethnic dference and unity in ersity.She then focused on the Queenrsquos speech, issuing a reminder that it dealt with a plethora of issues, with Brexit, the environment, National Health Service, climate change and devolved Institutions chief among them.ldquoOf these, Brexit has been one of the greatest political catalysts in Britain and Ireland, said Baroness Ritchie.ldquoIt has consumed all aspects of our lives in Northern Ireland since the referendum of June  where the people voted to remain in the EU. It has impacted on identity, sovereignty and nationality.ldquoLike the majority in Northern Ireland I want to remain in the EU and realise that due to the Governmentrsquos majority in this parliament we will leave the one institution that has provided so much political, social and economic stability on the island of lreland.Baroness Ritchie argued that EU membership had diluted territorial and mind borders and contributed much to reconciliation and developing the economy and infrastructure, urging the British government to look at how this can be achieved in any new working arrangements.ldquoBrexit has undermined the principles of the Good Friday Agreement in relation to reconciliation and building a shared society, the maiden speech continued.ldquoIt has deepened political isions at a time when our political institutions were collapsed. Being a concept that is essentially about the economy it has become a major constitutional issue in Northern Ireland.ldquoMoreover, the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will give effect to Brexit, will have direct consequences for trade between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Britain. It will also reduce parliamentary accountability and lessen protections for workersrsquo rights.Baroness Ritchie said people do not want borders either in Ireland or in the Irish Sea. She insisted they want to build reconciliation, intra community political progress, economic and social regeneration and social justice,the very factors she explained that were enhanced by EU membership and which could be damaged when the UK leaves.She continued: ldquoWe need the closest possible links with the EU. We need favourable trading terms with the EU and as a cautionary warning to the government, there canrsquot be zero trade details with the EU and then do our own thing. Borders and bureaucracy need to be lessened and a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU is required.ldquoThere is a need for access to the biggest market in Britain which takes half of our agricultural food sales from Northern Ireland which is equivalent of pound.bn. Coming from an area where there are two fishing ports, the fishing industry is looking for the current unhindered and unfettered access to itrsquos main market in Britain to continue.

This means that the temporary ban is set to remain in place.At Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, politicians discussed the detail of a letter from NI Water which detailed that the organisation has identied a requirement in the region of around pound.bn to maintain safe, clean drinking water and address main issues with sewer networks between  and .The news comes after NI Water revealed recently that during this period, an additional poundm investment will be required across the council area.While politicians are concerned about the poor waste water infrastructure in ious parts of the district, the need for investment in Saintfield is viewed as a key priority by many concerned atthe current moratorium on new-build schemes.The lack of investment in the districtrsquos sewerage infrastructure is being blamed on years of underinvestment in the system and the failure to upgrade networks of pipes installed decades ago which are struggling to cope with demand.Rowallane councillors Terry Andrews and Billy Walker say the situation in Saintfield needs to be addressed as a matter or urgency.Cllr Andrews described the detail of the NI Water letter as ldquoparticularly worrying and said the scale of the investment is unlikely to be made available by the government.ldquoThe current housing ban and the need to upgrade Saintfieldrsquos sewerage network is impacting on a signicant number of people and has ramications for the construction industry and buildersrsquo suppliers, he added.Cllr Walker said there were ldquoserious issues in Saintfield with the moratorium on new-build having an impact. He said the sewerage network needs an upgrade and this must be carried out as soon as possible.ldquoIn the past, raw sewage has been back flowing into peoplersquos toilets and spewing out from underneath manhole covers into gardens. Such a situation is intolerable. The current system cannot cope.Cllr Walker said the problem was not with the townrsquos sewage treatment plant but the pipes which supply it, explaining that suggested level of investment required to tackle the problem is in the region of poundm.He added: ldquoPeoplersquos lives in Saintfield are being made a misery. In the first instance, the poundm needed for the town must be found. If we donrsquot get satisfaction from NI Water at the end of the month and the Assembly is not sitting, we need to go directly to a direct rule minister.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said NI Water was making it clear that it did not have the budget to carry out the required work and blamed austerity measures on cuts to public services.ldquoI hope the Assembly will be up and running and we have a local minister in place and that there will be the required cash injection. The ban on new development does have an impact, particularly on the construction industry. The reduction on the block grant also isnrsquot helping.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said no big decisions were ever taken locally, but ldquokicked down the road forever and a day because political parties are afraid to make them.He added: ldquoThere is a day of reckoning coming for all public services and I remember reading years ago that the introduction of water charges would sort out the infrastructure problem.ldquoI am certainly not advocating that course, but the point is that these big decisions are pushed further along for someone  to deal with.

A minute later at the opposite end Jason Noade got on the end of a McGrattan corner, but headed over.It looked asRathfriland were going to take their - lead into the break as the game entered the th minute and good value they were for their lead.However, with  minutes gone Stefan Mason exploded into le. The rangy striker took on two Rathfriland defenders after picking up a long ball out of defence.He headed down the left flank and looked destined for the by-line, but stopped in his tracks, checked back, turned his markers and curled a lsquoworldyrsquo into the top corner of the net, giving Parr no chance.Two minutes later it was - Olympic and again Mason was involved. When his attempted cross was blocked, McGrattan headed the ball into Nathan Jonesrsquo path.Nothing looked on when Jones got the ball centrally, just inside the box, but he managed to get the ball from under his feet and beat Parr all ends up with a stunning finish and turn the game on its head.The second half was every bit as competitive, but Olympic seemed to have the measure of Rathfriland and were playing well within themselves until Peter Telford was given the freedom of the box and allowed to head in a Lockhart free kick to make it - in the rd minute.Jason Noade then headed a Jones free kick at lsquokeeper Parr and with  minutes played the busy McGrattan fired over after a nice build-up.Another searing run and cross from Fitzpatrick begged to be put away, but Rathfriland lacked a fox in the box and the chance was gone.Chances continued to be created at either end and with the respective lsquokeepers earning their corn with brilliant saves.However, the game was in the nd minute when Walsh came to Olympicrsquos rescue when he somehow kept out an effort from Marty Havern when the former Glenavon striker seemed certain to win the game for Rathfriland. Two periods of extra-time came and went before the dreaded penalty shoot-out took centre stage.Jones, Stevie and Jason Noade, McGrattan, Tate and James McClean netted for Olympic with Kilmartin, Johnny Roy, Nigel Prentice, Ruari Cunningham and Daryll Evans replying for Rathfriland before Walsh saved the day when he beat away Fitzpatrickrsquos penalty.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Stevie Noade, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Conor Reid, Ryan Molloy.

But they feel very strongly about this issue and are prepared to sacrice a dayrsquos pay to make their point. It is important to remember that the ongoing strike is not just about pay parity, it is also about safe staffing levels.Mr McConnell said NHS workers have watched staff leave ious aspects of the service and not be replaced which has left the provision of health and social services at ldquocrisis point with all services affected.He said staff have tended to keep their heads down to deliver services, explaining that they are now saying ldquoenough is enough.The Unison officials said while their members continue to go the extra mile for patients, this is impacting on their physical, emotional and psychological health.Mrs Ritchie added: ldquoStaff family lives are being affected and they have simply had enough, especially as they are being paid thousands of pounds less a year than their counterparts across the water.Mr McConnell added: ldquoThe bottom line is that the goodwill of staff has come to an end.

He also claimed the Assembly was sitting “because of a double blackmail”. “Blackmail of a secretary of state who says ‘I have the money to fix the health service but I won’t give it unless there is an Executive’,” he said. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “And of course the blackmail of Sinn Fein that you can only have a governmentyou pay the ransom that they demand.”Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken warned that government in Northern Ireland needs to be “transformed to work again”.“We have a real task ahead of us becauseanything we have seen over the last couple of years is that Northern Ireland desperately needs open, transparent, accountable and responsible government that is actually open to everyone in Northern Ireland to see how we are going to make changes,” he said.“Over the next two years, or however long this Assembly is going to run, we must be able to make our government work.”Alliance leader Naomi Long, the new justice minister, said her party is determined to tackle the work that needs to be done.“The deal which the governments have put forward is imperfect, I think all of us recognise that it is a compromise on the positions that each of the parties has taken in the negotiations,” she said.“There is optimism outside this place, it would be perhaps overstating our position as one that is optimistic, we are realistic about the prospects of this agreement.“There is a lot of work to be done, but we are also determined that it will succeed and we will play whatever role we can in ensuring that it does.”SDLP’s deputy leader Nichola Mallon was among those who joined the new Executive after being nominated as infrastructure minister.Weather warning issued for Sussex – heres all you need to know Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"She said it must deliver “genuine power-sharing” and urged delivery on health, education and securing welfare mitigation.“They are big commitments and we have been pushing both governments because we need to see financial support, clear financial support. But all of us must honour those commitments,” she said.“We genuinely want to see power-sharing. We genuinely and sincerely want to work with all parties, so that we can improve the lives of everybody living in Northern Ireland.“We have entered in good faith and we are taking at face value that everyone  is acting in the same spirit.”Green Party leader Clare Bailey expressed concern at the level of action in Northern Ireland over climate change.She welcomed commitments made in the draft deal which include a strategy to reduce carbon emissions and an independent environmental protection agency, but pointed out the Province is the only place across the UK or Ireland yet to endorse a climate act.“Let this new decade and new approach be one where Northern Ireland is no longer left behind as a place apart,” she said.Independent unionist MLA Claire Sugden said that Northern Ireland’s problems will not be fixed overnight.The former justice minister added: “If anything we need a root-and-branch review of every department in Northern Ireland, but it’s good that the wheels are now moving and I look forward to working with each and every one of you.”try catch  TrendingNI snow alert -

It is not about apportioning blame, it’s about establishing the truth and I think we are going to try and move forward now.“The British government has committed to move forward on the basis of the Stormont House Agreement in thisagreement and I think that is going to be a big challenge for Julian Smith, as a secretary of state, to explain in Westminster but also to convince people in Northern Ireland who want him to move ahead with this process, but to do it in a way that is fair and truthful.“And I think we can do that and certainly the Irish government is there to help and to work with communities to bring them on that dficult journey.“But that is a journey that is essentialwe are going to achieve true reconciliation in Northern Ireland which is ultimately what we need to do.”Beales in Worthing at risk of closure: heres all you need to know Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingNI snow alert -

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday November , . See PA story IRISH SinnFein. Photo credit should read: Brian Lawless PA WireThe order’s comments came after an interview by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald where she was asked about the matter.“The Orange Institution is not interested in engaging in ‘conversations’ or responding to hypothetical statements which merely assist Sinn Fein and nationalists as they continue to ‘talk up’ the inevitability of a united Ireland,” an Orange spokesman said.“Orangemen in many communities across Ireland have experienced Republicanism’s intolerance and hatred first-hand. Ironically, despite these comments, recent developments in the Republic of Ireland have shown us the reality that Sinn Fein and others are not really interested in equality – or the historical commemoration of anything deemed to be British.”Ms McDonald had told the Irish Independent she was willing to put celebrating the Twelfth of July across the island of Ireland on the table in talks about a future Border poll.She said “everything should be on the table” when asked specically about annual celebration.“I’ll tell you how we do it, we do it by having them [unionists] front and centre in the conversation and asking them, because I would be absolutely astonishedfor people of a unionist persuasion the issue around the Twelfth of July was not raised,” she said.“We, more than any other political party in the Oireachtas, are used to working with, living with, dealing with our unionist neighbours and the Twelfth of July is very widely celebrated.”Ms McDonald’s comments were made before the current controversy over the now-postponed Irish state commemoration of the Royal Irish Constabulary and Dublin politan Police. Sinn Féin led calls for the event to be cancelled altogether amid concerns it amounts to celebrating the Black and Tans.While acknowledging Sinn Féin supporters may not favour marking the Twelfth, Ms McDonald believes people will “surprise themselves” with what they find acceptable in a united Ireland.“Generally speaking, people are decent and reasonable and they want a good le for themselves and for their families and they are happy to accommodate and respect their neighbours so long as that accommodation and respect comes back to them,” she said. “They’re kind of the go-to issues when people talk about Irish unity, and that’s fine. Bring all of that to the table. Let’s talk about it.”While critics claim she is not in control and Sinn Féin is still run out of west Belfast, the paper said, she insisted Gerry Adams “doesn’t pull my strings, nobody’s pulling my strings”.Ms McDonald also declined to express regret for proclaiming “up the rebels” and “tiocfaidh ár lá” when she took over as leader. “No,” she said when asked about using militant Republican language. “Up the rebels.”LBC journalist and NI man Matthew Thompson tweeted: “That’s nice and all. But you’d think allowing unionists one day of the year to celebrate their heritage would be the least they might expect from a united Ireland.”In  former Sinn Fein TD Peadar Toibin said he was not sure the time was right for southern Orangemen to parade in their capital, saying there is “a broken relationship” with the order which needs work to be fixed.TUV Councillor Matthew Armstrong said the Orange community would treat the offer “with the contempt its deserves”.\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"portadown businessman sam hewitt enjoyed colourful life well lived ","story":"Car crashes into NI homeShops get drop in rates but pubs see a large spikeNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPortadown businessman Sam Hewitt enjoyed a colourful le well-livedWhen Sam Hewitt ran the Superglaze firm in Bridge Street, Portadown, everyone knew him as ‘Super Sam’.By The NewsroomWednesday, th January , : pmUpdated Wednesday, th January , : pm\"Sam Hewitt as drawn by Billy Austin.And that is how he will be remembered as hundreds of his friends mourn his passing.Sam died in Craigavon Hospital on Sunday afternoon after a brief illness and as family and friends reflect on a colourful le well-lived they will all remember Sam with much affection.Sam was  and he and his we, Margaret, lived at Annahugh House, Kilmore, one of the oldest houses in County Armagh. Sam, the third child of Norman and Jean Hewitt,was raised on a farm at Moneypennys and it was there thathis love for the outdoor le was nurtured. He would often recall his early days there, telling stories of sailing to Portadown along the canal on his canoe and spending hours in the fields observing the wildle along the river banks. It was there too that his spirit of adventure developed which ultimately led to a career in the Royal Air Force and a posting to Germany where he served for three years, developing a love for that country. That career was relived when the family gave him a trip in a Spitfire for his th birthday and Sam was delighted when the trip was featured on Anne Marie McAleese’s Radio Ulster programme Your Place and Mine. Having obtained a pilot’s licence earlier in le he enjoyed lots of flying time from Aldergrove and there were frequent trips to the Isle of Man with his we, Margaret, and daughter Claire.As a child and teenager Sam developed a close relationship with local horse dealers, the Hamill family, and this gave him the opportunity to ride horses, which became a le-long passion, passed on to daughter Claire and grandchildren Olivia and Rocco.Family was the most important aspect of Sam’s le and he and Margaret had three children, Claire, born in , Reuben in i and Samuel in . He was totally devoted to them, opening up opportunities for each ofthem to pursue a range of activities ranging from horse-riding to fishing and motor bikes and all sorts of watersports. And although Samuel was based in England there was nothing he enjoyed more than to arrive at Annahugh House and see his children play with the model trains Sam had so lovingly built.Because of his love for horses Sam was involved in the founding of the Armagh Horse and Pony Club and instigated pony camps for children in the Mourne Mountains. Until recently he wasa constant supporter of grandchildren Robin, Alex and Jude at rugby and cricket. Sam’s career was as colourful as his le. On leaving the Air Force he worked at Quintin Castle in Portaferry as the land steward where he continued his horse riding and began to sail and fish in Strangford Lough. Then he was a car salesman with Allens Automart, where he formed a lasting friendship with the owner, George Allen, and John Ford he dabbled for a while as a carpet salesman with Cyril Lord’s Carpets, then there was a spell as a paint salesman in Bridge Street before he went into business on his own with the Superglaze business in Meadow Lane. And all the while Sam’s infectious enthusiasm for whatever he did warmed him to everyone with whom he came in contact, forming a close relationship with the late Victor Locke who had emigrated to Hong Kong. Debonair Sam was an immaculate dresser and had a wardrobe to fit every occasion, whether it was a wedding, a funeral, a formal invitation or a sporting occasion and he stood out from a crowd with his sleek, silver hair.He was also a car enthusiast, his interest having been fostered at Allen’s Automart and he cut a dash as he enjoyed top-range sports cars over the years. Travel was another of his passions and he had been to Vietnam, Africa, America, where he toured the Grand Canyon, Thailand, Hong Kong andChina  But Sam will be best remembered for his friendship and there have been many tributes to him. He enjoyed his weeklylunch date with a group of friends, a get-together that been going on for some  years and one of that gathering, Ron Mullen, said, “Sam was a one-off. He was a wonderful friend and he always had the ability to brighten any gathering, no matter the circumstances. He will be sadly missed.”Retired school headmaster Jim Smart’s friendship with Sam goes back over  years and Jim said, “Sam was a frequent visitor to our house in Mandeville Street where my father ran a potato business. My mother always had the teapot on and we enjoyed seeing Sam arrive and giving us a bit of the fun that was part of his character.”Sam brought fun no matter where he went but he had his serious side too and his RAF training in discipline and decorum could come into play when the occasion demanded. He was comfortable in any gathering and was equally at home discussing world affairs or more mundane matters at home.People like George Allen, Ralph Loney and Mervyn Gilpin, all known for their Christian views, were among Sam’s best friends, even though he didn’t share all their views, but there was mutual respect on all sides and their friendship grew over the years.“Sam was a deep thinker and liked to argue his case,” said Mervyn. “I don’t think we ever saw eye to eye but we had a friendship that could never be broken and we all held him in the highest regard.” Sam is survived by his we, Margaret, daughter Claire, sons Reuben and Samuel, son-in-law Mark, daughters-in-law Zara and Lucy grandchildren Robin, Olivia, Alex, Rocco, Jude, Charlie and William, sister, Jeanette and brother Trevor.The funeral is to Roselawn Crematorium on Friday at pm and donations in lieu of flowers are to Help the Heroes, c oJoseph Poots funeral directors, , Bridge Street, Portadown. BT RAThe family wishes to place on record their sincere thanks to the doctors and nurses at Craigavon Hospital for all their care and attention to Sam during his short stay there.\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"shops get drop rates pubs see large spike ","story":"Portadown businessman Sam Hewitt enjoyed a colourful le well-livedA full ‘Wolf Moon’ will appear alongside the lunar eclipse in the UK tonight - here’s how to see itNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsShops get drop in rates but pubs see a large spikeSome retailers and banks in Portadown are to benefit from a drop in rates while a number of pubs face a signicant increase in their bills.By The NewsroomFriday, th January , : pm\"Portadown Town Centre.A new business rates valuation has been announced by Land and Property Services this week - the first shake up since .Chamber of Commerce President Adrian Farrell said the reduction in rates for some retailers was ‘a step in the right direction’.However he voiced concerns at the sharp rise in rates for some businesses in the hospitality sector.At least one licenced premises close to the town centre has seen their rateable value shoot up by almost % and will be expected to pay almost £k extra per annum.Another town centre bar will see a leap of % on their rates, and will be expected to pay more than £k extra each year. Even local churches will see a hike in rates with some payments rising by almost %.Meanwhile at least one bank will have their rates reduced by more than % and will pay £k per year less.Many shops in Market Street have had their rates slashed substantially, some by as much as %. A kiosk in High Street Mall will have its annual rates reduced by half.There doesn’t appear to be any change to the rates at the Meadows Shopping Centre while Rushmere Shopping Centre will see a rise of almost %.At least one outlet in Magowan Buildings will have a rates rise of almost % though others will see no change. ASDA will benefit from a drop in rates from £,, to £, - a drop of £k. Tesco Extra in Craigavon will see a % drop in its bill from £,, to £,, - a decrease of £kBucking the trend in the hospitality sector is the Seagoe Hotel which sees no change to its rateable value.The Omniplex Cinema in Craigavon will see the rates rise by almost % from £k to £k.Portadown Fire Station will also see a rates hike of almost % but Cascades Leisure Centre next door, which is due to close, will see a % drop in rates.Portadown Health Centre will see a drop of almost % in rates in April down from £, to £, - a drop of £,.Mr Farrell said: “I think this is a step in the right direction but I have concerns about the rise in rates in the hospitality sector.”He added that there needed to be a ‘radical reform’ of the ‘flawed rates system’ and called for online retailers to contribute to the rates system.In total draft valuations for all , businesses in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area have been published online.Known as Reval – this process will result in a new non-domestic Valuation List being used to calculate business rate bills from April . The Department of Finance said: “This process is about restoring fairness in the rating system by redistributing basically the same rating burden using more up-to-date values. A revaluation is not about collecting more money from businesses, but it is about ensuring that everyone pays their fair share.” Business rates are charged on most non-domestic premises including shops, offices, warehouses, factories, hotels and pubs as well as utilities such as gas, water, electricity and wind farms.The results show a modest growth in the total value in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area of .% compared to the current Valuation List which is based on  values. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary at Department of Finance said: “The revaluation means that from April, ratepayers will contribute to the funding of essential public services such as health, education and infrastructure as well as a wide range of council services relative to their  rental value, instead of  values as at present.“The growth in the total value of the Valuation List does not translate into a corresponding overall increase in rate bills. I will be seeking to ensure that the regional business rate poundage that we set is lowered to reflect the overall growth in the Valuation List. I will also be encouraging councils to do the same in respect of district rate poundages reflecting the fact that revaluation is not about raising more revenue overall from rates.”If rate poundages are adjusted downwards by both central government and district councilsthis would mean up to % of business ratepayers would either see a reduction or little or no change in their rate bill.Encouraging business ratepayers to view the draft schedule of values, Sue added: “I’m delighted that for the first time we are making the draft valuation list available on our Spatial NI . This will provide ratepayers with greater detail including a breakdown of how their value has been calculated as well as seeing the same information for similar properties in their local area and indeed for all similar properties across Northern Ireland. This approach makes the rating system much more transparent – which is absolutely the right thing to do.“I would encourage business ratepayers to go online and view the new draft values for their properties ahead of rate bills issuing in April.”Preliminary outcomes of the revaluation include:a modest growth in the total value in Northern Ireland of .% many high street shops and some shopping centres will see a decrease in rateable value, with some as much as %many of the edge of town retail parks will remain constant some of the largest food stores show a decrease in rateable value of between % and %the office sector shows an overall increase in rateable value of % andthe pub trade will see considerable iation in values with notable decreases in some pubs and signicant increases in some pubs in busy urban areas.As well as being able to view their new valuation online at a time that suits them, business owners can come along and talk to the Reval team at events across Northern Ireland to find out more about what their new valuation means for them. View the draft schedule of values at www.finance-ni.gov.uk reval--niIf ratepayers are unable to access the required information online they can contact LPS on Tel:   . LPS is encouraging ratepayers with queries about their new valuation to contact them. \"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/1578587871343.jpg--.jpg?1578587871000\\","title":"suspicious package at omagh s royal mail delivery office false alarm ","story":"The Royal Mail delivery office on Omaghs High Street was evacuated for a time on Wednesday morning following the discovery of a suspicious package.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business urging cross party political backing to restore assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community is urging cross-party political backing for a deal which could see the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
