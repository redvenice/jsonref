Considered the German artist\u0027s greatest painting, it depicts a group of aristocrats set against a backdrop of masterpieces. It was commissioned by Queen Charlotte in 1772, but she actually disliked the finished product. Zoffany was criticised for including too many figures, and according to one historical diary, the Queen \u0027would not suffer the picture to be placed in any of her apartments\u0027. Charles, however, is a fan of the intricate painting          Charles selected more than 100 pieces from private family paintings and photographs, major art from the Royal Collection and work by up-and-coming artists for the attraction - entitled Prince and Patron - which marks his 70th birthday year. Among the items above, a painting of Charles II is adjusted by a member of the Royal Collection Trust staff. On display are works from such masters as Holbein, Raphael, Rubens and Titian  In one section, painted oil sketches of William and Harry (above, right) by Nicola Philipps are hung next to watercolours painted by Charles in the 1990s on the Queen\u0027s private Balmoral estate.

It was during this rant that Barr made the comment \u0027muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes had a babyvj\u0027, using Valerie Jarrett\u0027s initials, that would see her show axed.Barr subsequently deleted the tweet but not before it had been copied and shared across social media, leading to swift calls for her show to be pulled from the air.          After Barr\u0027s now-infamous Planet of the Apes tweet had been sent, Clinton replied around 9am to say that she was not in fact married to a Soros, though she admired the work his foundation does.Barr subsequently sent a Tweet apologizing to Clinton for the mistake, though launched another broadside at Soros by claiming he was a \u0027Nazi\u0027 who betrayed Jews during the holocaust.The actress also launched a salvo at Clinton\u0027s actual husband, Marc Mezvinsky, saying: \u0027HER HUSBAND IS THE SON OF A CORRUPT SENATOR.\u0027Clinton\u0027s father-in-law is a former congressman and convicted felon who in March of 2001 plead guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of mail, bank and wire fraud.            But as the Clinton saga wound to a close Barr\u0027s tweet about Jarrett was catching a massive amount of attention, forcing the actress to brand her remark \u0027a joke\u0027.She also defended herself against allegations of racism by countering that Islam \u0027is not a race\u0027.The remarks were not enough, however, and around an hour later she offered a full apology to Jarrett and announced that she would be leaving Twitter.Shortly after midday Wanda Sykes, an African-American comedian and writer working on the Roseanne reboot, announced that she was walking away from the program.Around an hour later ABC broke its silence over the controversy to say that Roseanne was being cancelled.We now know that the network spent this time contacting Jarrett to apologize and inform her of the cancellation.Barr later said that the network had bowed to pressure amid calls for a boycott of Roseanne\u0027s advertisers, though ABC did not immediately respond to her remark.In its statement, ABC said Roseanne\u0027s remark was \u0027abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values\u0027.                          "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/21/00/4E72530100000578-5976287-image-a-38_1532129021809.jpg","title":"Revealing portrait Prince George fifth birthday","story":"    Prince George attends the Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy at Beaufort Polo Club, Tetbury          A photograph taken in London on July 2, 2014, to mark Britain\u0027s Prince George\u0027s first birthday           Prince George looks at his sister Princess Charlotte  in her pram on the Sandringham Estate          President Barack Obama, Prince William and First Lady Michelle Obama talks with Prince George          George enjoys weekends at Anmer Hall, visits to farm parks and country showsIt is an image of George, however, that friends of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge insist belies the happy, confident child their firstborn is developing into.

But friends insist he is no different from other young children. ‘Just because he reacts more cautiously than Charlotte when there is a camera around isn’t an indication of what he is like behind closed doors,’ says one. ‘Your first day at school is a big enough deal without all these strange people watching you. He is a very happy little boy.’William and Kate hope their choice of school, albeit one in the heart of an affluent area of the capital that has been dubbed Nappy Valley, will offer their son the chance to develop in a more rounded environment than other young royals.‘They thought long and hard about where George should be educated and really liked Thomas’s, which has a lovely nurturing atmosphere,’ a source said.‘The school focuses as much on helping develop the character of pupils, as what they learn. William and Kate are keen to allow George to spread his wings and make friends at this stage.‘They know there will come a time when they will have to sit down and talk to him about the implications of his royal status and why so many people are interested in him. He is becoming more aware of the cameras.

In fact, he had quit the course.He also posted a CV online which claimed he had more than 46 years’ experience as a doctor, despite then being aged only 41. The GP also made claims on his social media account profiles that he had studied at a university in New York – only later to admit he simply visited their library.He also boasted of having an article published in the Journal of Gastroentology, yet no evidence was ever found and it was deemed ‘entirely fictitious’.He even claimed to be a fellow of the American Association of Aesthetic Surgeons – but no such organisation exists.Now Samin, of Llandudno, North Wales, has been struck off the medical register after a week-long tribunal in Manchester.MPTS panel chairman Damian Cooper said Samin’s conduct undermined patients’ trust in doctors and brought the medical profession into disrepute.Share this articleMr Cooper said: ‘The tribunal determines that Dr Samin has been persistently dishonest and has demonstrated no insight into the seriousness of his actions and their consequences.‘Dr Samin’s actions have the potential for an adverse impact on the standing and perception of the regulatory process and the medical profession as a whole.‘The tribunal is concerned that it has had no evidence to show that Dr Samin has reflected on the events at all.‘The tribunal therefore concludes that it is necessary in the public interest to direct that Dr Samin’s name be erased from the Medical Register.‘In the light of all the evidence presented to it, the tribunal is satisfied that erasure is the necessary, proportionate and appropriate sanction.’ Dr Samin, who qualified as a doctor at Peshawar University in Pakistan in 2001, has been given 28 days to appeal against the decision.It comes after he appeared at Mold Crown Court last year when he admitted forging his doctor wife’s signature on a house sale document. He pleaded guilty to two charges and was given a 12-month community order and told to pay £535 costs.Samin, who had previously worked at Four Seasons Medical Centre in Orford, Warrington, Cheshire, then faced a GMC inquiry. In November last year, an initial MPTS tribunal banned him from the profession for four months after ruling that his fitness to practise was impaired.That first panel accepted Dr Samin’s evidence that his dishonesty was ‘not persistent’ and ‘it was a one-off incident’.However, a review tribunal held this year dug deeper into his professional qualifications and online boasts and uncovered a series of blatant lies.This month’s tribunal, held in Samin’s absence, heard how he had given misleading and false information to the first hearing last year.It added that his dishonesty had been ‘persistent, repeated and over a long period of time’. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/21/09/4E68362C00000578-0-image-a-2_1532160666871.jpg","title":"EU workers preferential treatment post Brexit Britain","story":"    Chancellor Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Sajid Javid had a major row over the right of EU citizens to live and work in Britain following Brexit          Mr Javid, pictured, insisted that EU nationals should not have priority over anyone elseAccording to the Telegraph, the pair had a row during the Cabinet away day in Chequers. According to minutes of the meeting Hammond \u0027disagreed with the Home Secretary on labour mobility and ending free movement\u0027.The Home Secretary insisted that following Brexit, freedom of movement must end. School\u0027s out for the summer!

With an \u0027ultimate elite, who are playing politics with real lives\u0027 becoming dominant, she said.            Sourby has been an avid campaigner of a soft-Brexit deal and said she will continue to keep fighting for thisHer intervention followed a drama-filled week at Westminster, in which Conservative factions have battled for control, while May tried desperately to keep her job and negotiate Brexit.On Monday, the Broxtowe MP gave a barnstorming speech during the debate on the customs bill, voicing anger at May\u0027s decision to do a deal with Rees-Mogg\u0027s European Research Group to head off a damaging rebellion. Until then Soubry had supported the prime minister\u0027s new softer Brexit strategy that was signed off at Chequers a fortnight ago.Reflecting on this, Soubry said: \u0027Since the referendum, the forces of darkness have taken over and they have continued to take over and this week if there was ever any doubt who was running this government it was quashed.\u0027Soubry has previously said she would leave the party if Jacob Rees-Mogg was to become the leader and earlier this week said she had been told by the Tory chief whip, Julian Smith, that \u002780 Conservatives, including a large number of members of the government\u0027 had told him they would not support the customs bill unless May accepted the ERG (European Research Group) amendments.The MP said she believed the ERG were \u0027ruthless bastards\u0027 who would stop at nothing because they believed their cause was \u0027bigger than anything else\u0027.  The 61-year-old MP said her view of the tight parliamentary arithmetic was that May would have to rely on about a dozen or so Labour MPs to vote with her because she believed that a hardcore of Tory ERG members would not vote for whatever was proposed.About five Labour MPs, including Kate Hoey and Frank Field, have consistently voted with the government on Brexit, but Soubry said more Labour MPs would be needed for May to see off any Tory rebellions: \u0027She needs the likes of Caroline Flint to get it through.\u0027Soubry conceded that the Tory remainer faction lacked the strength and discipline of the ERG up until now, adding that she and like-minded colleagues \u0027needed to grow a pair\u0027 because they had failed to pull out or pulled back from the brink when confronting the government on Brexit.Soubry said the remainers needed to muster 16 rebels if they were to defeat the government, assuming all the opposition parties voted alongside them. \u0027We did have at least 16 when the EU withdrawal bill came back, and the big mistake was that we did not do what we said we would do, which was have a vote on the Kerr amendment, which was very tame. That is recognised as being a mistake.\u0027            Soubry had previously campaigned for the UK to stay in the EU and was has openly critcised the Brexit processIf passed by MPs last month, that amendment, proposed by the former diplomat now crossbench peer John Kerr, would have forced ministers to explain what they had done to pursue remaining in the customs union.Despite her frustrations, Soubry said it would be \u0027deeply irresponsible\u0027 for anybody to challenge May and accused the prime minister\u0027s rival Boris Johnson of \u0027naked, blind ambition\u0027. She said the former foreign secretary and his supporters were engaged in \u0027willy-waving\u0027, making light of the consequences of Brexit. \u0027This is deeply grownup, serious stuff. Egos and this sort of willy-waving ambition is deeply unacceptable.\u0027Soubry, who was narrowly re-elected with a majority of 863 last year, said she had no intention of leaving the Conservative party, although she cooperates closely in parliament with pro-European Labour backbenchers Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie on Brexit. \u0027I shall be true to what I believe.

Greece and Turkey agreed earlier this month to focus efforts on easing tensions in the Aegean, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said after meeting Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan (pictured) on the sidelines of a Nato summitWhile tensions have long simmered, the rhetoric between the two neighbors has sharpened in the past two years: Two Greek soldiers detained by Turkey and eight Turkish soldiers seeking asylum in Greece have been the focal point of verbal jousting in recent months.The meeting with Erdogan, which lasted almost two hours, was not \u0027the easiest of meetings\u0027, Tsipras told journalists.The Greek soldiers were arrested in March after crossing a borderline between the two countries and face charges of illegal entry in Turkey.The eight Turkish commandos, who commandeered a helicopter to flee Turkey as a coup against Erdogan crumbled in July 2016, have sought asylum in Greece. Turkey says they were involved in the putsch and demands they be returned to face trial.Tsipras said he raised the issue of the Greek soldiers, whom, he said, were in custody without charge. In turn, he said, Erdogan raised the matter of the Turkish commandos who fled to Greece.\u0027I stressed, once more, I made clear, that in Greece, the Greek judiciary is totally independent,\u0027 Tsipras said, referring to applications by those iniduals to claim asylum.\u0027At the same time I underlined what I have repeatedly stated, that for the Greek government, coupists, from any country - from Turkey in this case - or anyone who attempts the breakdown of democratic order, are not welcome in our country.\u0027The two countries also agreed that their foreign ministers maintain contact on ethnically-split Cyprus, ided since a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup. The latest bid to unite the island under a federal umbrella collapsed exactly one year ago."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/21/17/4E767C3400000578-5977599-image-a-4_1532188910812.jpg","title":"Could tell 38 Chardonnay CLONED bottle half price","story":"The Prisoner vs. the Pickpocket, could an expert wine sommelier tell the difference between the two?In a test set up by The Times, renowned sommelier Andrew Bell, was put to the test to see whether he could tell the difference between the original and Replica Wine\u0027s creations.  In downtown Manhattan, two glasses of wine stood side by side on a table, both were full-bodied reds with lots of dark fruit and notes of cinnamon and cardamom.But one of them was a popular and expensive California red called The Prisoner and the other was an impostor: a clone concocted in a Colorado laboratory by Replica Wine.The firm adds in essences and grace notes to make it resemble something grander. By this method, Replica Wine is busy making copies of the most popular wines in the world, giving them cheeky names such as Knockoff or Pickpocket, selling them for half the price and boasting that no one can tell the difference.Mr Bell, who has worked in the wine industry for 35 years stuck his nose in each glass and then took three long sips, but could he tell The Prisoner from the fake?

But friends insist he is no different from other young children. ‘Just because he reacts more cautiously than Charlotte when there is a camera around isn’t an indication of what he is like behind closed doors,’ says one. ‘Your first day at school is a big enough deal without all these strange people watching you. He is a very happy little boy.’William and Kate hope their choice of school, albeit one in the heart of an affluent area of the capital that has been dubbed Nappy Valley, will offer their son the chance to develop in a more rounded environment than other young royals.‘They thought long and hard about where George should be educated and really liked Thomas’s, which has a lovely nurturing atmosphere,’ a source said.‘The school focuses as much on helping develop the character of pupils, as what they learn. William and Kate are keen to allow George to spread his wings and make friends at this stage.‘They know there will come a time when they will have to sit down and talk to him about the implications of his royal status and why so many people are interested in him. He is becoming more aware of the cameras.

With an \u0027ultimate elite, who are playing politics with real lives\u0027 becoming dominant, she said.            Sourby has been an avid campaigner of a soft-Brexit deal and said she will continue to keep fighting for thisHer intervention followed a drama-filled week at Westminster, in which Conservative factions have battled for control, while May tried desperately to keep her job and negotiate Brexit.On Monday, the Broxtowe MP gave a barnstorming speech during the debate on the customs bill, voicing anger at May\u0027s decision to do a deal with Rees-Mogg\u0027s European Research Group to head off a damaging rebellion. Until then Soubry had supported the prime minister\u0027s new softer Brexit strategy that was signed off at Chequers a fortnight ago.Reflecting on this, Soubry said: \u0027Since the referendum, the forces of darkness have taken over and they have continued to take over and this week if there was ever any doubt who was running this government it was quashed.\u0027Soubry has previously said she would leave the party if Jacob Rees-Mogg was to become the leader and earlier this week said she had been told by the Tory chief whip, Julian Smith, that \u002780 Conservatives, including a large number of members of the government\u0027 had told him they would not support the customs bill unless May accepted the ERG (European Research Group) amendments.The MP said she believed the ERG were \u0027ruthless bastards\u0027 who would stop at nothing because they believed their cause was \u0027bigger than anything else\u0027.  The 61-year-old MP said her view of the tight parliamentary arithmetic was that May would have to rely on about a dozen or so Labour MPs to vote with her because she believed that a hardcore of Tory ERG members would not vote for whatever was proposed.About five Labour MPs, including Kate Hoey and Frank Field, have consistently voted with the government on Brexit, but Soubry said more Labour MPs would be needed for May to see off any Tory rebellions: \u0027She needs the likes of Caroline Flint to get it through.\u0027Soubry conceded that the Tory remainer faction lacked the strength and discipline of the ERG up until now, adding that she and like-minded colleagues \u0027needed to grow a pair\u0027 because they had failed to pull out or pulled back from the brink when confronting the government on Brexit.Soubry said the remainers needed to muster 16 rebels if they were to defeat the government, assuming all the opposition parties voted alongside them. \u0027We did have at least 16 when the EU withdrawal bill came back, and the big mistake was that we did not do what we said we would do, which was have a vote on the Kerr amendment, which was very tame. That is recognised as being a mistake.\u0027            Soubry had previously campaigned for the UK to stay in the EU and was has openly critcised the Brexit processIf passed by MPs last month, that amendment, proposed by the former diplomat now crossbench peer John Kerr, would have forced ministers to explain what they had done to pursue remaining in the customs union.Despite her frustrations, Soubry said it would be \u0027deeply irresponsible\u0027 for anybody to challenge May and accused the prime minister\u0027s rival Boris Johnson of \u0027naked, blind ambition\u0027. She said the former foreign secretary and his supporters were engaged in \u0027willy-waving\u0027, making light of the consequences of Brexit. \u0027This is deeply grownup, serious stuff. Egos and this sort of willy-waving ambition is deeply unacceptable.\u0027Soubry, who was narrowly re-elected with a majority of 863 last year, said she had no intention of leaving the Conservative party, although she cooperates closely in parliament with pro-European Labour backbenchers Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie on Brexit. \u0027I shall be true to what I believe. It is my intention to stand again in Broxtowe as a Conservative candidate.

However, they had been set to wed this yearInitially, Japan supported Princess Mako, a 26-year-old doctoral student at International Christian University in Tokyo.However, scandal involving the Komuro family turned the tide of public opinion.According to reports, Komuro\u0027s mother had borrowed 4 million yen, or about £27,300, from an ex-boyfriend and then failed to repay it.Suddenly, the Imperial Household Agency reported the pair would postpone their wedding by two years, from November 2018 until 2020.          Princess Mako arrived in the country for the ceremonies to mark the 110th anniversary of the first waves of Japanese immigration to BrazilUnder Japanese law, female royals lose their titles when they marry out, although males don\u0027t.Reports of their engagement appear to have cooled off – leading to questions over whether the wedding will ever take place.Since Komuro will soon become a Fordham University Law School student, the US-based school wrote an article in which they described him as the fiancée of the princess.          Japan\u0027s Princess Mako will continue with royal duties until she drops her status for love in 2020But it was then quickly amended to suggest he was not engaged to marry the royal.\u0027Out of respect for the long traditions and practices of the Imperial Household Agency, we decided to remove the word \u0027fiancé\u0027 from the announcement because the betrothal ceremony has not yet been held,\u0027 the school said.The princess, who studied English at University College Dublin for one month in 2010 will not be the first to lose her title if the wedding goes ahead.Sayako Kuroda, formerly Sayako, Princess Nori is the only daughter of Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan.She gave up her imperial title and left the royals when she married Yoshiki Kuroda on 15 November 2005.Mako will be the ninth female member of the family to marry a commoner since the passage of the Imperial Household Law of 1947 governing the line of succession. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37c0a58456e3f92e1ab67b0ef50dac1b94cff3ad/1208_460_3574_2144/master/3574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59d025bda4e7630f83d1139a304bb7c9","title":"streets in the sky the sheffield high rises that were home sweet home love among ruins","story":"Rollerskating paper girls, daredevil sunbathers, high altitude milkmen … a new photography show beautifully captures the first and last days of a Sheffield estate and its residentsBill Stephenson had been trying to photograph the residents of one of Sheffield’s most notorious housing estates for some time when he realised he was going about things all wrong. No one trusted him, this outsider with a southern accent and a fancy camera, parachuting in from the city’s leafy Nether Edge area. They didn’t appreciate him hanging around Hyde Park flats, snatching photographs of them as they went about their lives amid the brutalist concrete they called home, perched on the hill above Sheffield railway station.He started to leave his posh Billingham bag at home. His Hasselblad, worth thousands, went in a carrier bag with a towel at the bottom to protect it. Sometimes he never even took it out. “Often I’d go up there and not take any pictures,” he says. “I’d just sit on a bench and smoke and chat to people, go for coffee at the drop-in centre. There’s always someone on an estate who knows everyone, so I found that person and got them to introduce me to everyone else.”It was 1988 and Hyde Park was set for demolition. Barely 20 years after its construction, residents were about to be scattered across Sheffield’s seven hills. It was a sad ending for what had been – along with its sister development, Park Hill – the ultimate symbol of Sheffield council’s pioneering postwar vision for social housing.It would have been easy, says Stephenson, to have just done “alienation” photography: “You just get someone standing in this brutal concrete environment with the building towering over them and the wind whistling around them.” The flats have often been depicted as a brutalist nightmare: director Shane Meadows used Park Hill as the home of his This Is England ’90 characters when they started smoking heroin.But Stephenson didn’t want to go down that road. The people he met, wandering around with his carrier bag and its precious cargo, loved living in Hyde Park. Yes, times were tough, with many residents unemployed after the closure of the pits and the steelworks. But they were proud of their community and didn’t want to move. He set about photographing them at home, sunbathing on the balconies, playing snooker at the youth club and canoodling in the doorways. There are bubble perms and stonewashed denim, knee socks and white stilettos, Saturday night gladrags and grubby playclothes. One particularly pleasing image shows Sue, a community linchpin and owner of the estate’s shop, stacking Nice’n Easy hair dye in her overalls. Her slightly raised eyebrows seem a warning to anyone who asked for credit – known locally as “strap”, as in “strapped for cash” – and didn’t pay it back. She’d name and shame them, Stephenson recalls, using cards placed in her shop window. Another afternoon he caught two girls, Anita and Emma, looking fed-up as they delivered newspapers in their rollerboots and school skirts.It wasn’t strict documentary photography. Most of the images are posed. Stephenson calls them “semi-formal”. He didn’t manipulate his subjects or get them to do anything they weren’t already doing, but he had their permission to shoot and they had a veto on their photos being made public.His favourite image was of a strapping young black lad known locally as Tony the Ton, who was mucking about with his eight-year-old nephew, Martin. Both are topless: Tony in red tracksuit bottoms and Martin in little grey shorts, his knees knocked together as he mirrored his uncle’s crossed arms. “I was just there talking to them and captured the moment,” says Stephenson. “They didn’t feel threatened by me.”Many of the pictures show what had become a very mixed community. One captures a teenage couple, Faisal and Paula, their arms entwined outside the service lift. He is wearing Joe Bloggs jeans with transfers on them, she is in baggy denim and an argyle sweater. He looks Asian, she is white – and seems shyly delighted to have bagged a boyfriend.Stephenson admits to seeking out these relationships. “At the time,” he says, “there had been a series of race riots across the UK and the press liked to talk a lot about racial tension, which I didn’t think told the whole story at all. What I saw at Hyde Park was a community that integrated beautifully.”The resulting pictures featured in a show at Sheffield’s Untitled gallery in 1988 and then toured nationally. Thirty years on, Stephenson’s pictures are about to go on display again, this time only a few minutes away from where they were taken. S1 Artspace, a gallery and collection of artists’ studios, has relocated from the city centre to the old residents’ garage behind Park Hill, which was listed by English Heritage in 1998 and is midway through a massive regeneration project by developers Urban Splash.S1 Artspace reopens in its new home today with Love Among the Ruins, a show that juxtaposes Stephenson’s pictures of Hyde Park with shots taken by another social documentary photographer, Roger Mayne, between 1961 and 1965. Mayne had been commissioned to show the early days of Park Hill, when it was the place everyone wanted to live – and before the Corbusier-inspired walkways designed for milkfloats had become a convenient escape route for ne’er-do-wells doing drug runs on their bikes.His images show the utopian vision of the architects, Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith, who had been tasked with solving the city’s housing and health crises by creating high-rise communities that would enjoy the same amenities as traditional neighbourhoods. The striking difference between Mayne and Stephenson’s images is the gender mix. In the 1960s, Park Hill appeared almost entirely populated by women. Bundled up in overcoats, curlers visible under head scarves, they went to the bingo and bossed the kids around while the men were out at work.By the time Stephenson arrived, the men were unemployed and the council considered Hyde Park flats a failed experiment in social housing. Shortly after he took his final frame, the bulldozers were sent in. He has kept in touch with many residents. One, Donna Hargreaves, contacted him recently after seeing a photograph of herself that was used to advertise the S1 show in the Sheffield Star. He captured her as a 14-year-old, straddling the fourth floor concrete balcony in white shorts and a red and white striped T-shirt with her friend Carmen. Now in her mid-40s, she planned to attend this week’s opening.Others did not make it into middle age. One boy took his own life a girl died after a life of health problems. For some, being photographed was a confidence boost. Leroy, whom Stephenson photographed on the Hyde Park swings as a 14-year-old, contacted him recently. “He said, ‘I was amazed you wanted to photograph me. People like me were invisible then: black teenagers living on a housing estate like Hyde Park.’ He’s doing really well now and has a great job as an IT guy.”Life changed for Stephenson too. He started a family and, unable to make ends meet doing social documentary photography, began taking commercial work: weddings on Saturdays, TV work and PR gigs that never made his heart sing. But he will forever be proud of the eight months he spent traipsing around Hyde Park with his camera in a carrier bag."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a73c08faa0c35546fbb97228e07f92196e51c61/647_367_4219_2531/master/4219.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eb5221bb05caca6e74d6133c20d64c6","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Emmanuel Macron and Pussy Riot at the World Cup final, Trump and Putin in Helsinki and the wonders of the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/facd740b70fb0b808caed3a31eb35067b43dbf7f/0_356_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0400e6b65f21a6e75a28517fd29993d7","title":"book interview gabriel tallent q and a","story":"Gabriel Tallent grew up on the Mendocino coast, California, with two mothers. My Absolute Darling, his debut novel, is the story of an isolated teenage girl who is being abused, physically and sexually, by her survivalist father. Set on the wild coastline where Tallent grew up, and following the feints towards freedom made by Tallent’s heart-piercingly courageous heroine, Turtle, it drew waves of praise when it was published in hardback and became the only literary debut novel to enter the bestseller lists in the US and the UK simultaneously last year.Was My Absolute Darling always going to be centred on Turtle, your 14-year-old protagonist, or did she come to life in the process of writing?My initial project was a much more academic, idea-driven book dominated by men,\u0026nbspinspired by James Thomson’s 18th-century poems, The Seasons, in which Turtle was a peripheral character. A few years into it, I had a draft from beginning to end, and I was even thinking about shopping it to agents, when I realised that Turtle’s story was the most important story, that for her the stakes were the highest, that in some sense everything else paled to academic terms next to her life. I had kind of a crisis, so I went and I pulled up everything by the roots and wrote the entire book trying to tell Turtle’s story in the most central way, beginning where I first felt I could illumine the stakes of her life and her emotional predicament, telling that story and abandoning all the rest of the material.Did you feel any hesitancy about taking on her perspective? Was that a\u0026nbspscary thing to do?It was a terrifying thing to do because it feels like the quality of attention that has to go into that book was immensely daunting, not least because of how painful the text has to be. I very much felt that it was going to have to be a tremendously difficult and dark book, in order to do it justice, and one wonders if one has the chops to do that, right? In writing about Turtle’s life, I thought I knew a true thing there, a true thing about hurt and what it is to survive hurt. I wasn’t embarking upon this as a lark. You want very much to think you have the strength and the rhetorical resources to put this true thing you’ve seen on the page without making it less, without killing it, without simplifying it, because to simplify it is to lose it.You’re talking about painful scenes in the book. Were they hard to write and did you feel a responsibility to get it right, to tread the line between exploitation and honesty?People talk about treading that line, but that’s not a real thing, that doesn’t make sense, no such line appears. It’s not as if the more truthful you become the more closely you approach exploitation. That doesn’t seem to be true about writing. Look, in college, I studied cultural history of the 18th century. These concerns grow up with the English novel. The questions of compassion and exploitation are central to the very origins of the novel. The problems presented by rendering a moral predicament are immensely close to my heart and knit into my entire intellectual history.It’s frustrating to come from an academic background and to see those problems handled in ignorant and ham-fisted and short-sighted ways when these are immensely complex problems. But because of this fucked-up world we live in, you’re always caught in this predicament, whenever you try and render the predicament of harm whenever you try and render those stakes, you run these risks. But the risks seem clearly worth it, because what is the alternative? The alternative is silence. When we talk about exploitation, exploitation is happening whether or not I write this novel. So long as the survivors of violence of any kind are condemned to absolute silence, so long as we say: “OK, that predicament is so morally abject that it cannot be spoken about”, so long will those be uninhabitable, unimaginable alien people. You consign that person to a kind of perpetual foreignness. That person is literally a pariah. Where does that leave you now – do you feel a responsibility to highlight other things in your second novel?In my second, I’m writing about friendships. Mostly. It’s sort of like a buddy novel that hinges on two friends climbing towers in the American southwest. It’ll be a lot about depression and the environment. But who knows? I think the answer is no – I’m not just going to go around pursuing difficult subject matters. I’m going to follow my inspiration and if it takes me to difficult places I’ll go there, but I’m not going to seek difficult places out.You grew up on the coast where the book is set. Were you as close to nature as Turtle is?Yes though for obviously super different reasons. I wasn’t neglected, I was passionate about hiking, and I spent a tremendous amount of time out there alone. It was all meticulously planned, I’d sit down with my parents and show them a map and a detailed chart of my mileage. More had to go into it because I had parental figures who cared deeply about my safety. But her passion about the back country is mine, the love of following the little creeks and streams is also mine.What kind of reader were you as a child?Voracious. I came to reading a little late and a little slow but when I did come I started reading just all of the time and loved big sci-fi swashbuckling epics that you can just lose yourself in, and I was prone\u0026nbspto reading the same book over\u0026nbspand over and over again to memorise long passages. I used to have big sections of The Iliad memorised but now I’ve lost it. And The Winter\u0026nbspKing \u0026nbspby Bernard Cornwell, but I don’t think I could do it any longer. That was years ago.What books and authors have stayed with you since childhood?Treasure Island. The Winter King I still read. All of The Oresteia.

Faced with falling sales and government pressure, though, she finds the attention to her gender a distraction by  Dominic Rushe. Photographs by Christopher LaneThe Fearless Girl is on the move. The bronze sculpture of a little girl defiantly facing off against Wall Street’s Charging Bull launched a million selfies and became an unlikely avatar of the #MeToo movement. Soon it will be transported a few hundred metres down the road in downtown Manhattan to confront another symbol of entrenched masculinity: the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Stacey Cunningham says she couldn’t be more delighted.“I think she’s fantastic,” says Cunningham, the 67th president of the NYSE and the first woman to head the male-dominated institution in its 226-year history. “For me, she is a message to iniduals, though. I think we need to call ourselves to action, especially as women, not to hold ourselves back.”Cunningham may be a fan of Fearless Girl, but she is not as happy with the gender-focused attention drawn by her elevation to one of the most high-profile jobs in finance. She gives a small, hard smile when asked about the coverage.She should not really be surprised. The number of women running businesses, let alone institutions of the stature of the NYSE, is still small. And the number of women running the US’s top 500 companies – many listed on the NYSE – fell this year.The floor of the stock exchange itself is also still a sausage fest. It is less male than it has been in the past, but that is because the number of men has been hacked away by technology, not ersity. The majority of the women on the exchange’s floor seem to be working for the 30-plus media outlets based there.Cunningham, 43, has been at the exchange on and off (and mostly on) since the 1990s. She says her surprise at the attention her appointment has brought may be because, in retrospect, she has always been gender-blind.“I always liked maths, science and problem-solving, so I gravitated towards engineering,” says Cunningham, who grew up in New Jersey, the fourth child of six, three boys, three girls. (“I’m the well-adjusted middle child,” she says.) She says she is disappointed that more girls don’t go into science and maths, but in her own case it was the obvious choice: “I didn’t think about that at all.”She must have had to tune out a lot. She first entered the NYSE in 1994 as an intern, when she was one of about 30 women among 1,000 men. “I walked in and right away I fell in love with the place,” she says. The “energy and the pace” reminded her of her family. “What struck me right away was the sense of community.”After she graduated, she came back to the NYSE, working on the trading floor until 2005, when she took time off to complete a culinary training course. She then worked at a rival stock exchange, the Nasdaq, as director of capital markets, before rejoining the NYSE and becoming the exchange’s chief operating officer in 2015.She acknowledges that things have changed for women at the NYSE in the decades since she first worked here. For one, they have proper bathrooms. When she started, women had to make do with one tiny bathroom converted from a phone booth, while the men’s bathrooms had a palatial lounge area.But she never experienced the rampant sexism other women in finance have complained about, she says. “When you walked through a trading floor 20 years ago as a woman, there was a little bit of you that could feel the room looking at you,” she says. But she says she never experienced any behaviour that made her uncomfortable.“In my experience, if I said to somebody: ‘Hey, that’s not OK, too much,’ and I said it with a smile, too, then they knew,” she says, giving that tight little smile again. “Whether it was the language people used, or something else that I didn’t appreciate, I just made it clear where I stood and I felt that I was respected for it. I’m not saying that every woman would have had that same experience. I’m sure there are women who tried to draw lines and they were ignored. I was fortunate that when I drew lines people stayed outside them.”Cunningham takes over the top spot at a challenging moment for the NYSE. Some of that is on view during my visit. I arrive for the opening bell that marks the beginning of the trading day and is a fixture of the financial news cable TV shows. We are corralled into a holding pen in line of the TV cameras as Cunningham rings the bell, alongside executives from BJ’s, a discount warehouse retailer, who are celebrating the launch of its share sale on the NYSE.The mood is frenetic, celebratory, somewhere between a graduation and the start of a race. But the energy is inside the corral, generated by the people who work for BJ’s, the exchange or the media organisations that report from the floor. Outside the pen, the number of brokers employed on the NYSE’s vast floor is in the hundreds, not the thousands of years gone by. You leave with the impression things will be pretty quiet once the opening ceremony is over.Most stock trading is now done electronically, principally from a far less photogenic datacentre in New Jersey. Its critics claim the exchange is a dog and pony show – Disneyland for capitalism, a marketing exercise where CEOs can ring a bell and a few traders run about looking busy for the cameras while the algorithms do the real work.“That floor is a TV station,” says one senior Wall Street executive, who did not want to be named. “There is pomp and circumstance, but it’s nothing but a bunch of clapping seals.”Cunningham and the NYSE could not disagree more. Algorithms cannot compete with human discernment and experience, or with days of big news. Cunningham mentions the day of the Brexit vote, for example – the human touch helped calm jitters. People bring “judgment”, she says. “One analogy we often use to describe how people add to that equation is an airline pilot. So, a plane can take off and land without a pilot. You don’t need to have a human being in the cockpit. But that human being adds value, especially during the most tumultuous times,” she says.Frankly, however, the argument over whether or not the NYSE’s much photographed neoclassical facade is sheltering a marketing operation or a vital financial institution is the least of its problems.One issue for all the exchanges, but the NYSE in particular, is that there are fewer and fewer share sales like that of BJ’s. Big companies such as Uber, Airbnb and WeWork are choosing to stay private for longer, powered by huge piles of private equity money.The competition – and some investors – are pressing the NYSE and the Nasdaq on their fees, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US’s main financial watchdog, has a pilot scheme under review that aims to assess how, and if, the complex system of fees and rebates the NYSE and others pay to brokers for trading on their exchange affects trading.Critics argue that the rebates on broking fees offered by the NYSE and others to encourage traders to use their market create a conflict of interest. They incentivise brokers to send their customer orders to exchanges that pay the biggest ones, even if their clients might be better served elsewhere.The two-year pilot, which has the support of some huge pension funds, would allow the SEC to assess their impact on how trades are made. But Cunningham says the scheme is poorly designed – it does not include the dark pools, for example – and the Nasdaq has hinted that it may sue to stop the scheme.It is a complicated issue, but one that will require Cunningham to spend more of her time in Washington.“The biggest worry for her is that the regulatory tailwinds are going the other way,” said Ronan Ryan, the president of IEX. Ryan, who runs a rival exchange that has been involved in a public spat with the NYSE over the fees study, says the NYSE is too dependent on the fees it charges for data and is on the wrong side over rebates.There is no air of crisis at the NYSE, which has dismissed IEX as an exchange with a “clearly failing” business model.And Cunningham does not believe the NYSE is in trouble. The financial world may be changing – and fast – but the NYSE remains the world’s most famous stock market. She is confident it can adapt and keep its pre-eminent position.“The future of equity markets is increasingly global, technology-focused and data-driven,” she said. In that world, she believes the NYSE “is uniquely positioned” to leverage its huge footprint, and technology, to stay ahead of the pack.On a brief tour of the recently refurbished NYSE – it looks like a particularly nice outpost of the luxury hotel chain W Hotel – we pop into a room full of portraits of past presidents – all pale males. One day, Cunningham will be up there, too. It is quite a first, even if she does not seem keen to acknowledge it. Perhaps Fearless Girl will ensure she is not the last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e182418e75f5dcc53fa67c3d5876ec38b7aaba06/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=107adb03e87ac871133da6c2a7a8f820","title":"toblerone to revert to original shape but with bigger size and price","story":"Poundland will be forced to drop the chocolate bar as it will weigh 200g and cost £3Toblerone is reverting to its traditional shape after an outcry over a move to widen the gaps between the triangles – and push though a huge price rise at the same time.The 150g bar was reduced from 170g in 2016 as a way to keep prices steady at about £1 a bar. The gappy new version was likened to a bicycle rack. One retailing source said that the new 200g bar’s recommended selling price is £3.09, although big supermarkets and large retail chains will be able to sell the bars on promotion at £2-£2.50. The source described the change as a “backdoor price hike on shoppers”.At the time of the 2016 change Glenn Caton, president of the northern Europe ision of Toblerone’s parent company Mondelez, said that the wider gaps were only a “short-term solution” and “not the right thing for the long term because of the iconic nature of the product”.A Mondelez spokesperson said: “We’re always reviewing our range to make sure we provide great quality Swiss chocolate in formats we know our fans love. The 150g Toblerone is no longer being manufactured and therefore availability of the bar depends on how much stock an inidual retailer is carrying. But 100g and 360g size bars will still be available.”The change in shape and price, first reported by The Grocer trade journal, means that Poundland will no longer stock the bars. Toblerones are the discount chain’s most popular product and it sold 12m of them last year. Poundland said that stocks would run low within weeks.The discounter said it would respond by bringing back a redesigned version of Twin Peaks, its Toblerone copycat bar, at the end of the summer. Poundland sold half a million of the lookalikes earlier this year but has been forced to redesign it after a legal battle with the Swiss original’s owners.“Globally, chocolate consumption, especially that with high cocoa content, which is regarded as healthier, is up,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18f9327029a24bb152cc84e957d1f6da0570becd/43_982_3554_2133/master/3554.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70ce164e352a47415db825eb0fcf95a5","title":"melancholy isolation pittsburghs parking lot attendants in pictures","story":"Given Pittsburgh’s poor public transport, many commuters choose to drive.

It was the title of a 1984 book by biologist Edward O Wilson, who claimed humans are genetically drawn to seek out and feel more zen in nature. In 2005, author Richard Louv proposed that not seeing your greens could cause Nature Deficit Disorder (NDD), a low-mood condition similar to Seasonal Affective Disorder (Sad).“Nature is good for us because humans are part of nature,” says Dr Miles Richardson, director of psychology at the University of Derby and founder of the Nature Connectedness Research Group. The science of why is down to a three circles model, where wellbeing is a delicately weighted balance between drive, contentment and threat. “Being constantly driven at work can mean our threat response is overactive, positive emotions are reduced, and we become anxious. Nature reduces sympathetic nervous activity associated with drive, and increases parasympathetic nervous activity associated with calm,” he says.  Relaxation comes whether you bathe in a forest or simply look at some roses – so it’s not necessarily being in nature that relaxes you, but feeling connected to it. “Simply noticing three good things in nature every day, such as a flower growing on the pavement, increases connectedness and, therefore, wellbeing,” adds Richardson. Light rightThere’s a reason that getting the window seat is such a big deal – it is, in fact, scientifically good for us. A study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found that sitting by a window during your working day results in 46 minutes more sleep every night.Where windows-for-all isn’t an option, architects are plugging into the new trend for circadian lighting: LED systems that mimic the angle and colour of the sun to sync with our bodies’ awake and sleep cycles. “Evolution has led us to expect a bluer light in the afternoon and a redder light in the morning and evening. Manufacturers are starting to produce systems with wavelengths to echo this,” explains Joe Croft, head of environmental and sustainability at Overbury, a wellbeing-focused fit-out firm. Air-ratedPolluted air doesn’t just create temporary physical symptoms such as problematic skin, and irritated eyes, nose and throat, it also contributes to the risk of chronic illnesses – but new tech is assisting the fightback against bad air. “The world’s first smartphone with air-quality sensors was released in February. Soon, more and more people will have the technology in their pocket to measure the quality of air around them,” says Croft. Colour of creativityThe psychology of shades has been a talking, dressing and wall-painting point ever since psychologist Angela Wright identified how colour influences our reactions back in 1984. Today, much of the focus is on how our environment spurs creativity. Sensory “triggers”, such as different textures of materials, are thought to keep the brain engaged, improving our ability to access knowledge. The significance of colour is also now thought to vary depending on where you are. According to the Human Spaces report, creativity is best boosted by green and purple colours in the UK, red design accents in India and water features in Brazil. Immersed in waterThe effect of urban water on wellbeing is the very latest area of environmental research. While the value of green space is in no doubt – the charity Fields in Trust equates the health benefit of the UK’s parks to around £34bn – water features, such as rivers, are less well examined. A special project will look at how 18,000 Europeans’ lives are influenced by water, meaning we could soon be splashing around a new buzzword: blue health.Look out for Clinique’s “purity patrol” fleet, carrying commuters around London, Manchester and Birmingham in air-purified rickshaws from 19-21 July.

For some, it’s the promise of Tom Cruise chucking himself from the top of a skyscraper to land in a golf cart. For others, it’s anticipating just how bleak Michael Hanneke is feeling about the world in any given year. For me, it’s two simple words: “starring Cher”.In recent times, opportunities to fling cash at whichever cinematic Cher vehicle is around have been few and far between the last time was for Burlesque, in 2010, an overcooked story about an ambitious dance troupe that also starred Christina Aguilera and\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspsomehow, despite that, ended up not being camp, which was not a decision that worked in its\u0026nbspfavour.What a treat, then, that Cher is back to save the day in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, a film into which she is literally helicoptered in to “get the party started” (and to release an album of Abba covers).I interviewed her a few years ago,\u0026nbspa fact I like to mention within the first couple of minutes of meeting anyone, and I asked her why she wasn’t acting as much as she once did. “I’m too old to be young and I’m too young to be old, so I have to be used creatively,” she explained, then she slagged off Burlesque (“horrible”), which was hugely entertaining.There has been much to enjoy about Mamma Mia 2’s arrival, from the meme-fication of pictures from the premiere to Christine Baranski, forever Diane Lockhart and so much more, going viral after being told she has Big Dick Energy. But the fact that Cher is barely in it, really, and that at 72, she’s playing the mother of Meryl Streep, 69, shows that casting directors are still not sure quite what to do with her, other than to let her be Cher. That’s a spectacle I’m always happy to see, but nevertheless, it’s one that leaves me wanting even more.One spectacle more satisfying than any blockbuster appeared last week in the form of a brief clip of CCTV footage, which showed a customer in a pizza restaurant in Savannah, Georgia, casually grabbing the backside of a waitress as he passed her, not bothering to look at her or look back.Emelia Holden, the 21-year-old on the receiving end, was not having any of it. In a flash, she turned around, grabbed his T-shirt, put him in a headlock, superhero-style, and pulled him to the floor. She told him off, then asked her colleagues to call the police.There’s no sound on the tape, but it’s possible to imagine what she shouted as she pointed her finger at him and gave what looks to be a furious dressing-down. The groper, who was said to have been having dinner with his wife, has been charged with sexual battery. Holden has set up a Go Fund Me page to direct the attention she’s been receiving towards raising money for a cat shelter.I have devoured this story like a novel. The initial scenario is so familiar and recognisable – ask any woman if she’s had her bum pinched or grabbed or slapped in a public place, and how many times she has, like me, ignored it or shrugged it off – but the ending is new. To see an unfamiliar outcome, in which an act that seems so easy to the perpetrator is not treated as a small irritant, as something to be put up with, is strange and thrilling and necessary.Holden told the Inside Edition TV show that even she had been surprised by the force of her reaction: “I didn’t even know I could do that.”Bear Grylls has put his name to a new theme park-style “adventure attraction” due to open at Birmingham’s NEC this autumn, where visitors will be able to go on “one of the most extreme days out you can ever imagine”. (If that’s all it takes to be an adventure attraction, I should start selling tickets to go clothes shopping with my mother.)As celebrity endorsements for theme parks go, Grylls makes more sense than most. He’s an ex-SAS adventurer so hard that when he was stung by a jellyfish, a Spice Girl weed on his hand. He was trying to eat the jellyfish at the time, so beast truly triumphed over man, in that case.Not everyone is booking their advance tickets. A change.org petition has been set up to protest against plans to offer ing with sharks, though organisers argue that the attraction will give part of its proceeds to conversation charity the Shark Trust. At least the sharks should fare better than the animals on Grylls’s Channel 4 series The Island, which are slaughtered on camera for contestants’ “survival”, when a better way of surviving might be to not near-starve people for entertainment on TV."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/906278105bddc0dc05efab1beeb12416420c623f/1_0_4610_2767/master/4610.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=031245c7e3293643f471ef51e7717fbb","title":"denver nuggets where to eat and drink in colorados capital","story":"From the best pizza to the finest brewpubs, if there’s a restaurant or bar worth knowing in the Mile High City then chances are that local food doyen Kade Gianinetti has tried it out.

Since co-launching coffee company Method Roasters in 2013, the gourmet-entrepreneur has opened food truck-turned-LoHi-hotspot American Grind, two bars (the Way Back and Wayward) and the recently opened daytime diner, Wendell’s.So what’s delicious about Denver? “It’s starting to be taken seriously as a foodie city,” he says. “The food being served here is on par with any in the country. You’re getting high-quality stuff and people who really care.” City-wide, people are pushing to make local, sustainable food accessible to all. “It’s not just fancy farm-to-table restaurants or high-end cocktail bars,” says Gianinetti.  “Diners and neighbourhood restaurants are stepping up and creating really cool options that are supporting our local farms and a range of other local businesses.”And what’s on Denver’s menu next? “We’ve set groundwork for some of the most creative food and beverage offerings that we’ll see in any city over the next five years, with each neighbourhood boasting its own identity and personality and unique food scene.”Cart-DriverAnybody coming to town who wants to get a feel for what Denver is should do themselves a favour and go to Cart-Driver.

Go-to order: the clam pizza.SpuntinoTheir food is incredible, but it’s super-passionate owner Elliot Strathmann’s knowledge of digestifs and aperitifs that makes Spuntino. He has a vintage collection of spirits, and if you’re nice enough to him he’ll let you sample some really old Italian amaros.Ratio BeerworksThis is an awesome microbrewery, with a beautiful patio right on Larimer Street.

In winter, spring and autumn, it responds to rich conditioner like a weeping willow does to a biblical downpour. But in summer, when it gets drier and straw-like, it soaks up the right product gratefully while managing to keep some bounce.A newer discovery, and frankly a revelation, too, is Dizziak (£22, 200ml). This deep conditioner was formulated by the beauty expert Loretta De Feo, who was frustrated by the ineffectiveness of most conditioners on her afro-textured hair. The result is a mineral oil-, silicone-, cruelty- and sulphate-free concoction that, despite sounding exactly like a product that would make my stubbornly Celtic mop droop despairingly, makes it feel like silk (if you have similar hair, use a pea-sized amount: a little goes an extraordinarily long way). I’ve passed it on to one thick-haired redhead, a coarse and curly-haired biracial friend and a curly-haired woman of Pakistani descent, and all declare themselves unequivocal converts, too. Dizziak can also be used as an all-day moisturising mask on holiday – it doesn’t make hair look greasy – showering out before dinner for a clean, soft texture that still does as it’s told.

A Prayer Before Dawn borrows its name from the book, though the source material’s subtitle, A Nightmare in Thailand, would be more fitting.Joe Cole (Peaky Blinders) is a bubbling volcano of unexpressed emotion as Moore, arrested, presumably, for possession of drugs while on holiday in Thailand. The film isn’t interested in detailing his backstory. Instead, it seizes the moment of his arrest and zeroes in on the dizzying assault of suffering that follows. Sauvaire’s film is unblinkingly, exhaustingly violent, the ordeals on show grimy with blood, sweat, shit, piss, vomit and semen. Men are tortured over loudspeakers, gang-raped, pummelled within an inch of their lives for a hit of ya ba, a highly addictive form of crystal meth. The prison’s boxing team is Moore’s only solace when he enters the ring for his final fight, it’s wearing a bamboo halo (or Jesus’s crown of thorns).The combination of handheld HD\u0026nbspcameras at close range and Nassim El Mounabbih’s astonishing sound design makes for primal, first-person cinema. The sensory thump of boxing gloves, of blood pounding in the eardrums, of flesh smacking flesh is interrupted by the woozy, disorienting silence of concentration while in the ring.There’s little dialogue to begin with, but Sauvaire chooses to leave much of the film unsubtitled in a bid to further alienate the viewer, aligning them with Moore. At times this feels uncomfortable, the Thai characters at risk of reading as foreign savages. Yet many of the non-professional Thai actors, all ex-prisoners and real-life boxing champions, bring detail and lived experience to their performances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b7e5e60ea5e5210adaf7f01d77d286d3925f98f/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8c62808c7a8f398a25e7645502aee9a","title":"nigeria uk relationship should focus more on trade says minister","story":"Development secretary Penny Mordaunt is to review aid budget for west African nationThe international development secretary, in Nigeria on a two-day visit, has laid out plans for reviewing the way the UK allocates aid funding.On her first visit to west Africa as secretary of state, Penny Mordaunt said that, as the UK’s exit from the EU in March 2019 approaches, she wanted to see Nigeria’s relationship with the UK move towards greater trade and investment.“We want to move from a relationship based on aid to one of economic prosperity and trade,” she said, speaking to the . “That’s what Brexit is part of. There are really big opportunities here in future years.” According to the Department for International Development (DfID) UK-Nigeria trade was worth £3.4bn in 2016.A new Human Capital Index announced by the World Bank will come into effect later this year. It ranks how much countries invest in “human capital” such as education and health relative to their wealth and ability to fund those services. The measure was announced by the World Bank’s president, Jim Yong Kim, in April, with Mordant and Bill Gates early supporters.From next year the index will be used by DfID as a significant part of a formula determining whether UK aid will be reviewed to recipient countries. The new measure could lead to significantly reduced funding for countries like Nigeria that underinvest in health and education.The UK spends £300m on foreign aid in Nigeria, making it the third largest recipient of British assistance globally after Pakistan and Ethiopia. The budget spent on Africa’s largest economy is seen within the international development ministry as a focal point for reviewing aid. A unit set up in February has worked on improving tax collection in developing countries, reducing dependency on aid further.Mordaunt said: “This has been a real success story in what we’re trying to achieve. What we want to do is to try and move from an aid relationship, making sure that we were being smart about the money we spend. What we want to do is say to the British taxpayer that we have done the most good with the money we have in our budget.Last year, £100m of UK aid went towards alleviating the humanitarian crisis left in the wake of the Boko Haram terrorist group’s nine-year insurgency in north-eastern Nigeria.Approximately 1.7 million people remain displaced, with millions still in need of food assistance. President Muhammadu Buhari had pledged to defeat Boko Haram and, despite severely degrading the group from the occupying force it was before his term began in May 2015, it remains a threat, with deadly attacks occurring more frequently in the past few years.After controversial claims to have defeated Boko Haram made by Buhari’s administration, in the past year the Nigerian army has urged thousands of internally displaced people to return to their homes, promising that their towns have been secured from any terrorist threats. Yet aid groups have raised concerns that towns recently recovered from Boko Haram remain deeply insecure, posing a risk to returnees. Attacks in the past few months in recently opened towns such as Bama have killed dozens.On Thursday, the aid organisation Médecins Sans Frontières said the humanitarian situation was deteriorating, describing the continuing threat and severe need in towns deemed by the military to be safe. “The reality is that the places they are moving to are not prepared to provide even the most basic services,” said Luiz Eguiluz, the head of MSF’s mission in Nigeria. “The problems in north-east Nigeria are changing instead of being solved.”Mordaunt said that she wanted to see towns where internally displaced people have returned to fully secured. “There’s no good people returning if security is not in place. What we want to do now is really help move from that humanitarian situation to a recovery and stability programme. You need all players in that, a programme where people who return to those areas return to full security, jobs and livelihoods.”She stated that humanitarian assistance and training provided to the Nigerian military to defeat the group would continue but her department was encouraging Nigeria to do more to address the humanitarian crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c3f250e99f4993b85f989bb6c29ca79df01c9d7/0_248_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32617b0d7e5257c8563c71ae6136a935","title":"gruff rhys i found britpop difficult we couldnt really get on board","story":"The musician, 48, on the importance of his Welsh identity, campaigning to remain and taking a tank to festivals to use as a sound systemMy first memory is being allowed to walk to the shop on my own.

Given where Super Furry Animals came from and what our politics were, we couldn’t really get on board, despite the fact that we were hugely influenced by Anglo-American culture, too. When I was young, I was hugely inspired by the Welsh punk band Anhrefn. They would end their gigs by playing the Welsh national anthem. I\u0026nbspthought that was unbelievably cool.I campaigned for Remain during the Brexit referendum. When I wrote the song I Love The EU, I didn’t mean to write a song for the campaign. I just had a really terrible song title and the song came out of it.I’m unbelievably disappointed that Wales didn’t qualify for the World Cup. If they had, there would have been a queue of Welsh bands knocking on the door of the Welsh FA. When we qualified for the Euros in 2016, there were dozens of songs. It was a festival of song! It was fun doing ours, Bing Bong. I’m just concentrating on the Welsh women’s team now. We’ve got to beat England. Winner takes all!When Super Furry Animals got signed, we quickly made a decision to make the most of our good fortune. We were really interested in pranksters like the KLF and the Sex Pistols, and so, when we saw marketing people spending loads of money, we bought a tank, decommissioned it and took it to festivals as a sound system. Our plan was to buy all the armoured vehicles on earth and decommission them. Every time we got a platinum album, we’d buy another. But things didn’t work out like that.

Coco Khan picks out some of the bestA conversation can speak volumes and in the world of audio dramas, they often do. The audio drama – a piece of fiction told using several voices – is in the midst of a renaissance. Previously consigned to rare radio slots on rainy Sundays, audio dramas are now ubiquitous, buoyed by audience tastes for podcasts, and attracting some of the world’s most exciting writers and actors.These are professional, high-quality productions – think Netflix for your ears. And like Netflix, Audible has begun commissioning original audio dramas, making them free for members, putting an end to the bottleneck in which many creatives vie for one radio slot (and a broadcaster therefore has to pick the one with broadest appeal). Audio dramas run the gamut, whether you want a tear-jerking tragedy, an edge-of-your-seat thriller, or a heart-fluttering romance. With such variety, they make for perfect accompaniments to your summer holidays, whether you’ve got a long-haul backpacking trip planned, or a short and swift city break lined up.But with so many options, where do you begin?We picked out five of the best audio dramas from Audible, so you don’t have to. All you have to worry about is whether or not you can resist binge-listening your weekend away.The Child “My name is Simon. I’m 10 years old. I’m a serial killer.” So begins Sebastian Fitzek’s chilling tale of a boy who claims to have killed in a previous life. Set in Berlin, the story follows the child and the only people who believe his cryptic utterings – his mother and a lawyer she has hired. But when Simon’s knowledge leads to several bodies being discovered, the police start to suspect the lawyer. He must solve the crimes before the police put him in the frame, no matter what it takes. Fitzek is one of Germany’s most lauded crime-thriller writers and has seen his work translated into 20 languages. His talents are at their height in this intricate, spine-tingling adaptation. The fabulous narrators include Emilia Fox (Polanski’s The Pianist) and Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks).Northanger Abbey If audio dramas are having a renaissance, Northanger Abbey might be the Sistine Chapel. A slick, star-studded adaptation of Jane Austen’s classic, this ambitious production has redefined audio storytelling – which is to be expected, given the cast. National treasure and Bafta award-winning actress Emma Thompson tops the bill, bringing Austen’s dry wit to life, while supporting performances from Lily Cole and Jeremy Irvine elevate the series to GOAT (greatest of all time) level. This coming-of-age story follows 17-year-old Catherine Morland through love, danger and intrigue, satirising the gothic tales that were popular at the time of writing, while taking a shrewd look at the British class system. Such skewering of high society feels as fresh as ever. Even those put off by historical drama will find joy in this.Neverwhere Nobody anticipated the impact the BBC’s 2013 adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s cult novel by the same name would have. Broadcast over six days, the production was a smash hit with Gaiman fans and non-fans alike, propelling the audio play into the public eye and showing just how exciting the form can be. Download to listen to Benedict Cumberbatch, David Harewood, James McAvoy and Natalie Dormer telling the story of Richard Mayhew, the unassuming Londoner who finds himself in London Below, a magical version of – and coexisting with – the real city, known as London Above. Originally conceived as a television series, Neverwhere lends itself to episodes, and so its separation into six parts feels natural and seamless. And on Audible it includes over 25 minutes of additional unbroadcasted material, including extended scenes, bloopers and outtakes.Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book: The Mowgli Stories One for the slightly older kids (and also the parents), The Mowgli Stories brings together all of Kipling’s tales about the boy raised by animals in the jungle. Though the average listener might think they know all there is to know about Mowgli from the much-loved Disney film, his adventure takes many more twists and turns. This retelling of the timeless classic stays true to Kipling’s darker side and the well-known cast, including comedian Bill Bailey and actors Richard E Grant and Celia Imrie, make this one unforgettable audio drama. A must-listen for anyone who has seen the film, and a brilliant, truthful, introduction to the work of Kipling for those who haven’t.Locke \u0026amp Key One of Audible’s first forays into commissioning original audio dramas is still among the most ambitious undertakings the form has seen. Locke \u0026amp Key began life as a graphic novel – so translating the form from highly visual to solely audio was no small feat. To do so, Audible drafted in Locke \u0026amp Key’s creators, Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez, to ensure the adaptation stayed true to its dark, terrifying roots. And it worked, assisted no doubt by the voice of scream queen Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) and Haley Joel Osment of “I see dead people” fame. Locke \u0026amp Key follows a family who, starting over after a tragedy, set themselves up in a quiet town that is also frequented by demons. A sharp production that will have you jumping out of your skin and sleeping with one eye open.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible - £7.99 a month after 30 days.

In November 2006, Abbey (now Santander) began offering mortgages of five times salary. Vince Cable, then the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesman, called the news “very alarming”, adding that it was “likely that these irresponsible lending practices will lead to financial disaster for many people”.A spokesperson said: “Clydesdale Bank’s latest mortgage offer is available for a very small group of highly qualified customers ... As with all mortgage applications, our lending decisions are based on a full income and expenditure assessment to assess inidual affordability, ensuring that we continue to lend responsibly.”Other lenders have eased lending restrictions in recent years, but none has gone as far as Clydesdale.The other “stretch” happening in the mortgage market is to lengthen the term of the loan. While 25-year terms were the standard in the 1990s, 30 years is now the norm for new borrowers, with many lenders stretching to 35 years to make monthly payments more affordable.But mortgage brokers said they were relaxed about Clydesdale’s new deal. David Hollingworth of London \u0026amp Country said: “I think that this is more about being able to lend borrowers the amount that they can demonstrate will be affordable and to keep a degree of flexibility where appropriate, rather than a move to remove the reins on what a lender is prepared to lend.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2087fc933062e8a54fc8186bf4211bfd1eb33191/0_288_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=984382250d51efaeed9237f1f440557b","title":"anna soubry accuses theresa may of capitulating to tory forces of darkness","story":"The Conservative rebel Anna Soubry has accused Theresa May of capitulating to “the forces of darkness” in her party and warned that, as a result, she and her fellow soft Brexiters may not back the final deal the prime minister obtains from Brussels.The former minister accused Jacob Rees-Mogg’s faction of pursuing a hard Brexit that would cost “hundreds of thousands of jobs” and said they were “now running Theresa” because the prime minister was forced on Monday to accept their amendments to the customs bill.In an interview with the , Soubry pledged to carry on fighting for a soft Brexit but conceded that the balance of power within her party had changed. An “ultimate elite, who are playing politics with real lives” had become dominant, she said.Soubry’s intervention followed a dramatic week at Westminster in which Conservative factions have openly battled for control while May tried desperately to keep her job and negotiate Brexit.On Monday, the Broxtowe MP gave a barnstorming speech during the debate on the customs bill, voicing anger at May’s decision to do a deal with Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group to head off a damaging rebellion. Until then Soubry had supported the prime minister’s new softer Brexit strategy that was signed off at Chequers a fortnight ago.Reflecting on those events, Soubry said: “Since the referendum, the forces of darkness have taken over and they have continued to take over and this week if there was every any doubt who was running this government it was quashed.”The MP said she had been told by the Tory chief whip, Julian Smith, on Monday afternoon that “80 Conservatives, including a large number of members of the government” had told him they would not support the customs bill unless May accepted the ERG amendments.That would have been enough to topple a flagship piece of Brexit legislation, and forced No 10 to agree to the amendments, one of which was designed to frustrate her proposals for a customs arrangement in which HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs could collect some duties on behalf of the European Union.The MP said she believed the ERG were “ruthless bastards” who would stop at nothing because they believed their cause was “bigger than anything else”. She added: “Now that the forces of darkness have got the prize in sight, they are going for it. I’m afraid that Theresa has embraced these people, they are now running Theresa.”ERG members and supporters include a range of Tory backbenchers, from veteran anti-Europe campaigners, such as John Redwood and Bill Cash, through to former ministers David Jones and Steve Baker, and young MPs including Andrea Jenkyns, who want to force out May. Rees-Mogg is its chair.Soubry accused May and party whips of operating a double standard, saying: “Jacob Rees-Mogg gets his tummy tickled when the ERG threatens to vote against a government bill unless it is amended on policy.”In contrast, when her ally Dominic Grieve “suggested parliament should have a vote in the event of no deal, which is process”, he and his potential Tory supporters were treated differently. “You are threatened, you are called a traitor, you are threatened with deselection, threats the like of which have never been seen before,” she said.Soubry warned the prime minister that she and her smaller group of about a dozen “mutineers” had not given up and could not be relied upon to vote for whatever the prime minister brought back from her Brexit negotiations.The 61-year-old MP said her view of the tight parliamentary arithmetic was that May would have to rely on about a dozen or so Labour MPs to vote with her because she believed that a hardcore of Tory ERG members would not vote for whatever was proposed.About five Labour MPs, including Kate Hoey and Frank Field, have consistently voted with the government on Brexit, but Soubry said more Labour MPs would be needed for May to see off any Tory rebellions: “She needs the likes of Caroline Flint to get it through.”Soubry conceded that the Tory remainer faction lacked the strength and discipline of the ERG up until now, adding that she and like-minded colleagues “needed to grow a pair” because they had failed to pull out or pulled back from the brink when confronting the government on Brexit.Soubry said the remainers needed to muster 16 rebels if they were to defeat the government, assuming all the opposition parties voted alongside them. “We did have at least 16 when the EU withdrawal bill came back, and the big mistake was that we did not do what we said we would do, which was have a vote on the Kerr amendment, which was very tame. That is recognised as being a mistake.”If passed by MPs last month, that amendment, proposed by the former diplomat now crossbench peer John Kerr, would have forced ministers to explain what they had done to pursue remaining in a customs union.Despite her frustrations, Soubry said it would be “deeply irresponsible” for anybody to challenge May and accused the prime minister’s rival Boris Johnson of “naked, blind ambition”.She said the former foreign secretary and his supporters were engaged in “willy-waving”, making light of the consequences of Brexit. “This is deeply grownup, serious stuff. Egos and this sort of willy-waving ambition is deeply unacceptable.”The MP, who was narrowly re-elected with a majority of 863 last year, said she had no intention of leaving the Conservative party, although she cooperates closely in parliament with pro-European Labour backbenchers Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie on Brexit. “I shall be true to what I believe. It is my intention to stand again in Broxtowe as a Conservative candidate. I just want my party back, please.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2db596953644aa90f5184f63c2e065e32c34411d/0_174_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a5eddf3910995f50c9cd6bb4dd50b36","title":"post brexit registration system eu citizens trial august","story":"Test phase will launch in three Liverpool universities and 12 NHS trusts in the north-westThe government is looking to recruit up to 4,000 EU citizens for a live trial of its post-Brexit registration process next month.It will launch the test phase on 28 August in three Liverpool universities and 12 NHS trusts in the north-west of the country. It will mark the beginning of a three-year programme to register the estimated 3.8 million EU citizens settled in the UK under EU freedom of movement rules.After Brexit, all EU citizens will be required to sign up for a new “settled status” to enable them to continue to work, live and receive benefits including healthcare in the UK.The Home Office said the live pilot would “allow those working on the scheme to test the system using real applicants and make improvements ahead of the launch of the scheme’s phased rollout towards the end of 2018”.Those who sign up to the live trial will be the first to receive settled status.The 12 NHS trusts taking part in the trial are: Aintree University hospital Blackpool teaching hospital Countess of Chester hospital East Lancashire hospitals Lancashire teaching hospitals Liverpool heart and chest hospitals Liverpool women’s hospital Southport and Ormskirk hospital the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University hospitals the Walton centre Warrington and Halton hospitals and the Wirral University teaching hospital.The three universities taking part are the Liverpool Hope University, Liverpool John Moores University and the University of Liverpool.The immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, said the scheme would make it easy for EU citizens to get the status they needed.The scheme has been controversial because it will mean all EU citizens, who were up to now treated as if they were British, will be required to have official identity numbers that will be used by employers, landlords, banks and public services, including hospitals.Last month the Home Office unveiled its online and smartphone application process, admitting the identity verification element did not work on iPhones."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aff72957188fded2e74d09d0704ff4d96619568/325_0_2905_1744/master/2905.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1abd5403892c89d6457c2e24cc1c7bb","title":"jacob rees mogg says uk is heading for no deal brexit","story":"Comments from Tory MP and hardline leaver come after EU mauls Brexit white paper plansJacob Rees-Mogg has said Britain is heading for a no-deal exit from the EU, and that leaving on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms is now likely.Presenting a phone-in on LBC, the prominent Tory MP and hardline Brexiter said: “I think we are heading to WTO and I think WTO is nothing to be frightened of.“I think we should carry on negotiating until the end. I don’t think we necessarily need the theatrics of walking away, but the truth is that WTO is likely to be all that they will offer us.”He made his comments as Theresa May dug in on her Brexit offer to Brussels after the EU publicly doubted the controversial proposals were workable.Government sources said the prime minister was “standing over” the Chequers cabinet compromise on withdrawal plans, despite the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, mauling the initiative.Barnier openly questioned the credibility of the UK’s proposals in his first response to the government’s Brexit white paper. He expressed concern that May’s suggestion of a “facilitated customs arrangement” opened up the risk of major fraud, additional bureaucracy and damage to EU businesses.In comments that are likely alarm hard Brexiters in Tory ranks, the vice-president of the European parliament and MEP for Ireland’s governing Fine Gael party, Mairead McGuinness, made it clear that May would have to abandon some of her red lines to clinch a deal.Speaking to the BBC, she said of London’s proposals: “It’s a starting point, it’s not an end deal. I think the British prime minister set out red lines too early on and too deeply.“We are prepared to show flexibility if the British prime minister can show flexibility.”The defence minister Tobias Ellwood insisted the white paper was a workable compromise. He told the BBC: “There is no yesyes solution here which will balance out the extreme views of the Brexiteers and the extreme views of the remainers. It is therefore essential that we have compromise.“And this is exactly what the white paper does. It means that we have for the remainers, we have access to goods and services, a deal with Europe as well. We have financial markets as well.“And on the leave campaign side of things, the bill, the EU bill stops. We leave the customs union, we leave the agricultural policy, we leave the common fisheries policy, and, of course, we are able to strike our own deals.”The leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, said she hated the Chequers compromise, according to The Times, quoting minutes of the cabinet meeting at the PM’s country residence earlier in July.

Then women began reporting unwanted pregnanciesLast summer I had an abortion. Statistically unremarkable, yes, but mine wasn’t because of a split condom or a missed pill. I was four months into a tense relationship with a much-hyped Swedish “digital contraceptive”, a smartphone app called Natural Cycles. I had spent my 20s on the pill, but hated not knowing whether my emotional state was down to artificial hormones or not. My boyfriend and I had been together for eight months, and I was desperately seeking something new, something that wouldn’t make me feel so anxious.That’s when the adverts started following me around on social media: glowing women reclining in Scandi bedrooms, all pale grey sheets and dappled light, brandishing basal thermometers and telling me how great it felt to “get to know yourself better”. Natural Cycles’ ads promised the “world’s first contraceptive app”, something “natural, hormone free \u0026amp non-invasive”. I could start using it without a two-week wait for a doctor’s appointment and so, in a fug of hormones and frustration, I bought a subscription. I was sold on shiny promises, a sleek user interface and the fact that a former Cern physicist, Elina Berglund, was at the company’s helm. But four months in, it failed. Berglund helped discover the Higgs boson but it turns out her algorithm couldn’t map my menstrual cycle.Femtech, or female health technology, is going through a boom phase, with an estimated $1bn of investment raised worldwide in the last three years. Apps such as Clue, Dot, Glow and Spot On are all popular period trackers, but Natural Cycles is the only one certified as contraception. In 2017, it was approved for use across the EU, getting the green light from the German inspection and certification organisation, Tüv Süd.How does it work? It comprises an app, an annual subscription of about £60, and a thermometer accurate to two decimal points (free in the post). You input your temperature as soon as you wake up, and the app makes predictions about your fertility each day: green for “go have unprotected sex”, red for “not unless you want a baby” (you can also use the app to plan a pregnancy). No hormones, no implant and, supposedly, no stress. It has its own language: users are known as “Cyclers”, and useful information is available via a “Cyclerpedia”. It seems as easy as ordering a takeaway or a taxi from your phone of course there’s an app for fertility, too.Natural Cycles has now registered more than 700,000 users from more than 200 countries, 125,000 of them in the UK. But its certification as contraception is under review in Sweden, where the company and its married co-founders are based. In January, a major Swedish hospital reported that 37 of the 668 women who had sought an abortion there between September and December 2017 were using Natural Cycles as their sole birth control, and the Medical Products Agency of Sweden began to investigate. Natural Cycles has responded that the number of pregnancies is proportional to the registered number of Swedish users and “in line with our expectations” but as someone who didn’t report my own pregnancy last year, keeping it secret even from my parents, I wonder how many more there have been. I spoke to Amy, 29, who was fed up with hormones when she started using the app as her sole birth control. Three months later, she was pregnant, a “massive shock”. Though she admits she may have made a mistake, she can’t pinpoint the error. “You’re told all you need to know is yourself. I believed in it the same way I did the pill and thought I did everything right.” Having already booked her wedding, she went ahead with the pregnancy, giving birth weeks before she walked down the aisle. “It’s supposed to make you feel like you have more control, but in fact it did the opposite: when I fell pregnant it felt like a decision was taken out of our hands. It wasn’t how we’d have planned it, and I don’t recommend weddings two weeks postpartum, but I’m lucky it was something we wanted in the long run.”Marie, 30, first heard about the app when she saw an Instagram post about it (search for Natural Cycles and you will find hundreds of posts by influencers telling you how it changed their lives). “I didn’t spot the hashtag at the very end of the caption which said that it was a sponsored post,” she says. She had been taking Yasmin, a commonly prescribed contraceptive pill, for six years when she made the switch, hoping that the app would be a reliable and easy alternative. A year into a relationship, and eight months into using Natural Cycles, Marie realised she was pregnant. She had an abortion that proved traumatic, contributing to the breakdown of the relationship and leading her into what she describes as “a pit of despair”.She didn’t want to tell anyone about it. She’d had an abortion once before, when a morning-after pill didn’t work, but this time she felt ashamed: “I felt like I’d acted alone in the decision to use the app and had been overly trusting. But I was also angry that I’d been treated like a consumer, not a patient.”Like Marie, I didn’t go to my GP before I switched to the app, probably because I subconsciously knew he’d advise against it. In many ways he knows me better than any algorithm can. He put me on the pill at 18 because I had an irregular cycle. I later learned I had polycystic ovary syndrome, which I now know makes me a terrible candidate for Natural Cycles, because my ovulation is unpredictable and erratic.A year earlier, before I’d heard of the app, I had been to see a gynaecologist to discuss birth control, thinking I wanted a non-hormonal coil fitted. It was the first time a medical professional had helped me to truly understand the extent of my options. She drew me a set of coordinates and plotted each option available (no app got a mention) to show me the benefits and drawbacks. Spotting v cramps, depression v maintenance, long- v short-term.I’d read grim things about the hormonal vaginal ring – a widely shared article about a young, fit woman who died after a blood clot – but agreed, based on what she felt would suit me best, to try it. We laughed at how it’s impossible to research any birth control online without encountering horror stories. I told myself I would trust a professional and cease my Googling as it only induced anxiety but after a few paranoid weeks wearing compression socks to avoid blood clots, I was done.I now know that the ideal Cycler is a narrow, rather old-fashioned category of person. She’s in a stable relationship with a stable lifestyle. (Shift-workers, world-travellers, the sickly, the stressed, insomniacs and sluts be advised.) She’s about 29, and rarely experiences fevers or hangovers. She is savvy about fertility and committed to the effort required to track hers. I could add that her phone is never lost or broken and she’s never late to work. She wakes up at the same time every day, with a charged phone and a thermometer within reach. When I talk to Raoul Scherwitzl, the CEO and co-founder of Natural Cycles, he is charming and sincere and calls at precisely the appointed hour, not a second early or late. “My wife and I represent a typical user-couple,” he says. “Elina was on hormonal birth control for 10 years and we knew we wanted children, but in a couple of years. We both had PhDs in physics and were working at Cern, dealing with messy, fluctuating data, trying to look for the Higgs boson, which is basically looking for a signal amid noise. We started applying the same statistical methods to pinpoint my wife’s ovulation amid her varying temperatures. We read up on the literature and developed an algorithm which our colleagues started using, too. We were running it on the Cern servers and then using Google spreadsheets. We saw it as an unmet need. There was a lack of choice and we wanted to innovate in an important field.” I tell Scherwitzl that, though the need is real, after purchasing the app, caveat after caveat revealed itself. I didn’t know it would take months to become reliable. “The algorithm is cautious by design,” he explains. “It gives red days unless it’s sure.” I tell him how I got pregnant, when the predictions changed after I’d had sex. Scherwitzl empathises (“I am sorry to hear that”) but says that as well as “downsides”, there is “a huge upside with all the happy users” and that “the most important thing is to use protection on red days: it relies on that”.What about the targeted advertising? Isn’t it strange to get social-media influencers (one prominent Swedish blogger is now an investor) to promote a medical product? He doesn’t think so. “Social media allows us to control the narrative because there’s lots of misinformation out there, not just with us but with every type of birth control. We can also target the right age group.”The investigation by Sweden’s medical watchdog is now six months in, and has started its second phase, reviewing marketing material, past clinical studies and fresh user data. Reports of unwanted pregnancies have not, however, had any negative effect on the business.In a 2016 interview I wish I’d read, Scherwitzl’s wife and business partner Elina Berglund described her ideal user as a woman who is planning to have children at some point, and who would like a break from hormonal contraception before trying. It’s not a good option for women who want to entirely avoid a pregnancy, she said. But somehow this message has got lost in Natural Cycles’ marketing this is very much not what the word “contraception” means to me.Indeed, on the section of the Natural Cycles website aimed at medical professionals there is a “decision tree” for doctors considering prescribing the app as birth control. Is the patient over 18? Is she satisfied with her current birth control? If the answers to those questions are yes and no, then the third is: would she be “devastated” to get pregnant within the next year? If the answer is yes, the doctor is told not to prescribe the app. Perhaps those questions should be compulsory when you click through on a Natural Cycle link.Instead, the app assumes the intimate voice of a trusted doctor, mixed with the sort of gamified messaging you find on other apps. You might get an update saying, “Nice curves! You have a nice and smooth temperature curve with small day-to-day variations. Keep up the good work!” The company’s social media is peppered with hashtags such as #yourcyclematters and #wakeupmeasuregetup. The perkiness is grating – even the thermometer bears the slogan “Good morning!” – and can be pressurising, too. One woman I spoke to who bought Natural Cycles to try to plan a pregnancy told the company she wanted to leave after six months, as the daily tracking was too stressful. She emailed to ask for a break, “for emotional wellbeing”. A customer service manager responded to say she could cancel, and reactivate when she wanted, but that “I took a quick look at your data, and in terms of ovulation everything looks good!”, adding, “You do not need to worry about losing any data – we never delete anything!” Those exclamation marks don’t make such reassurances any less creepy.Perhaps this false sense of intimacy is why it felt more like a betrayal to find myself pregnant than if the pill were at fault. After the abortion, the honeymoon period of my relationship ended abruptly. It felt like we’d begun our romantic race with a false start. I stopped using the thermometer and went back on the pill, but it took me a while longer to part ways with the app. I deleted it from my phone, only to realise the direct debit was rolling and non-refundable. I have just been sent another £60 bill, for a contraceptive app I no longer use, that got me pregnant. But it’s not just the money that bothers me – it’s the reminder that I put so much faith in a technology that in the end relied on something as unreliable as my body. What’s the hashtag for that? • If you would like your comment to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc0eed5d299c93d58400bb9c5a873beff3884db8/0_50_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fbdda56e386c08402ef6989a6233084","title":"propping up bar working samaritans learned to listen","story":"When I moved to New York, I knew no one – would listening to strangers cure my loneliness?When I was in my mid-20s, fresh out of graduate school, I worked as an office temp in New York. It was like being invisible for my whole working day. Everywhere I worked, people called me Christina or Elizabeth or Stephanie – any girl’s name. No one cared that I was a writer. No one ever even asked me to lunch. I ate alone every day. I had just been through a bad breakup, and many of my friends had moved away, so often I ate dinner alone, too. I began spending more time at the bar across the street from my apartment building.The bar was called Toby’s and it was dim and rectangular, with time-darkened floors and a scary red-painted bathroom. Students went there as well as locals, and the bartenders were friendly, so there was always someone I knew. I told myself that I was using the bar as a sort of community centre – a meeting place for civic-minded neighbours. I went there to gather with local townspeople for political and public awareness Toby’s was a rich component of urban community life alcohol was not the point at all. I wasn’t a regular. (I was totally a regular.)I wasn’t the only one. Others included a man who looked absurdly like Barney Rubble. An estate agent named Lina. A man in a leather jacket, who ended all conversations by saying, “Shoulda, woulda, coulda.” A younger man with long flowing hair and combat boots. A thin, intense young woman who wrote poetry. The bartender’s girlfriend was there every night, doing crossword puzzles. I had the distinct impression that she didn’t dare let the bartender out of her sight. And there was an exceedingly creepy regular named Willie. Willie worked around Toby’s – washing glasses, restocking supplies – as a way to keep up with his bar tab, which must have been astronomical. He was short, with greasy grey hair and a bloated face and teeth like dirty kernels of corn. His eyes were the worst – glittery and vulturine. He always found an excuse to walk behind any girl who stood at the jukebox, or brush up against any girl who used the payphone, or squeeze past any girl who stood in line for the bathroom. The poet and I would occasionally have irony-free conversations about how we never seemed to have time to write, but the others seemed to tolerate me, if not especially like me.During my lunch hour at temp jobs, I began making calls about volunteer work. I applied to Samaritans and was accepted. For two weekends, I went to volunteer training sessions, which I loved, because I liked being a student again and I was intrigued by some of the emotional stories. As part of the training, all volunteers were asked to attend a local Alcoholics Anonymous meeting so we could see what it was like to seek help, as well as to give it. I found a meeting in the basement of a church in my neighbourhood and, when I walked in, lots of people recognised me and waved hello. (Maybe I was spending too much time at Toby’s.) I ended up having a good time – more studying, more stories, plus they served free doughnuts.I completed my training and started working at Samaritans. Ironically, the call centre was grim, dingy and depressing. Chipped lime-green walls, two battle-scarred desks and squeaky roller chairs. It wasn’t all that different from Toby’s, actually, although it lacked a jukebox.It is daunting, even frightening, to answer calls at a suicide prevention line, but you get used to it quickly. Samaritans taught the volunteers an algorithm to use on callers, so I always had an idea of what to say. They also taught us never to use the word “I” in a sentence when talking to a caller, and that helped me focus. And besides, most of the calls are from repeat customers and they know how to put you at ease.Because, like Toby’s, Samaritans had regulars – so many that there was a whole three-ring binder with notes on them called the Regulars Book. New volunteers were supposed to read through the binder and familiarise themselves with the regulars, so that, for instance, you didn’t spend two hours talking to Crystal about her feelings of worthlessness only to have her say at the end, “Well, I guess I’ll give you a call again next week when my husband goes bowling.”We were supposed to work the assessment algorithm with the regulars. It was supposed to go like this: Are you thinking of suicide? No. Have you thought about suicide in the past two months? No. Have you ever attempted to kill yourself? No. Oh, well, thanks, goodbye. Click.But it didn’t really work like that because the regulars had got wise to it and, if they felt like talking, they answered yes to one of the questions and that prompted you to ask more. Do you have a plan? Do you have access to pills or weapons? And then the regular would say yes to one of those questions and it would prompt other questions and the call might go on pointlessly for half an hour when, really, all the regular wanted was a little sympathy about how overpriced cantaloupe is.I got to know them all: Frank with his disabling shyness, and Calvin, whose chronic bronchitis kept him housebound, and Eva, whose children never called, and Ricardo with his addiction to couponing, and Roberta with her crippling fear of laundromats, and Mark with his ailing mother. They weren’t suicidal, most of them – they were unbearably lonely. Their loneliness was so palpable it flowed down the lines toward me, as thick and sticky as old motor oil. I did my best with all of them, tried to do whatever good I could in a 10-minute call. I knew that, often, I was the only person they would speak to that day. It seemed to be enough just to say, “Did something happen today?” or, “That sounds truly upsetting.” The only regular I disliked talking to was a girl named Rosie, who called sometimes to talk about how her writing career had stalled. “And I’m a fucking excellent writer!” she’d say. I worried that Rosie and I had too much in common.Some regulars called pretty much every day, as a sort of check-in: “Not too badly, thanks, though they were clean sold out of coleslaw at the deli.” Some called weekly: “Well, just thought I’d let you know I’m still upright.” Sometimes the regulars disappeared for months or even years. No one knew what had happened to them during these hiatuses, but I always wondered. Did the regular get more functional and actually go out in the world and live life for a while? Or did they get less functional and spend time in a hospital, perhaps one where phones were not allowed? Or did they take up with some other, more desirable hotline and only return to Samaritans when the new hotline stopped taking their calls? In nearly all respects, the regulars mirrored my romantic life up to that point.There was a chalkboard where volunteers left notes for the incoming shift about regulars. “Maude’s been watching the Weather Channel again.” (Maude had a fear of storms.) “Abe’s mother is in the hospital.” “Bob says Meals on Wheels didn’t show.” And, once, excitingly, “Dena is sending us eclairs!”Dena was like a Facebook ranter 20 years before Facebook even existed. She called almost every day to say something like, “People used to have manners!” and, “Maybe I’m old-fashioned, but I believe in hard work!” and, “I guess any idiot can get a medical licence.” And now she was sending us eclairs – unexpected but very much appreciated. The eclairs arrived the next week, in a white box with a green ribbon. Some volunteers refused to eat them – they thought Dena might be trying to poison us – but I thought they were delicious, all the more so as they got slightly stale.A local TV station wanted to do a story on Samaritans and the administrator asked me if I would be willing to appear on the segment. I found this wildly flattering, even though it was just going to be the back of my head that appeared: Samaritans wanted to maintain the anonymity of its volunteers. I showed up for the televised shift and sat at the desk while the camera crew set up and wired me for sound. As soon as they were ready, the lines went silent. We waited. And waited. Finally the phone rang and I answered immediately, using what I hoped was a soothing, professional tone, “Samaritans, can I help you?”“Oh, hello,” said a woman with a matter-of-fact voice. “My husband is set to work the next shift at Samaritans and he’s gone off and left his lunch here on the table.”“And how do you feel about that?” I asked, acutely conscious of the camera.“I don’t feel any particular way about it,” the woman said. “But do you all have some crackers and peanut butter to tide him over? I tried to call him at the office but he’d already left.”“Yes, we do,” I said, and then, for the cameras, I added, “It may be hard to believe it now, but you won’t always feel this way.” This was one of the all-purpose remarks they taught us in training.“Probably not,” the woman agreed cheerfully. “Thanks a lot!” She hung up.I turned around. The camera crew was already packing up. “You did a great job,” the producer told me.The segment aired on the evening news the next night. The cameraman had caught me in profile and I was immediately extremely recognisable. The next time I walked into Toby’s, all the regulars cheered. People bought me drinks for a week.Now the Toby’s regulars began to think of me as a good listener. Lina told me about her daughter’s sciatica and helped me find an apartment. The leather-jacketed man asked my advice on his music career and gave me the number of a good locksmith. The bartender’s girlfriend let me help her with the crosswords and even smiled when she saw me. She was pretty when she smiled. Barney Rubble turned out to be a homicide detective and helped me with the plot of a short story. (No one at Samaritans had ever helped me with the plot of a story, but then no one from Toby’s had ever sent me eclairs.) The poet got a job in midtown and now I had someone to meet for lunch. I realised, belatedly, that the Toby’s regulars were just as lonely as the Samaritans regulars. And – even more belatedly – I realised that I had been lonely, too. Now I belonged.One night Willie followed a pretty student out of Toby’s and kissed her as she drunkenly waited for a cab. The bartender opened the door and whistled sharply. “Willie, knock it off!”The girl extricated herself and a taxi pulled up to take her home, but I couldn’t get over it. “That poor girl!” I kept saying to the bartender. “She’ll never be the same!”He was more philosophical. “She’ll be all right.”“Here’s what’ll happen,” the bartender said. “She’ll cut back on her drinking for a while, she’ll defrost her freezer, she’ll call her mother more often than she used to. In no time at all, she’ll be fine.”It wasn’t quite what we said at Samaritans, but it wasn’t that different. And it did make me feel better.Samaritans had a Christmas party at a bar – for the volunteers, not the callers – and I met lots of new people. Most importantly, I met the man who is now my husband. I was sitting at a table with three beers lined up in front of me because I disliked queueing, and I guess he thought that showed practicality, or industriousness, or maybe just forward thinking. He came over to talk to me.A year later, we moved to London, and I said goodbye to my temp agency – “Goodbye, Josephine!” they said – and the regulars at Toby’s. I couldn’t say goodbye to the regulars at Samaritans because we weren’t allowed to give out personal information, but I wanted to. I still think of them. Sometimes I want to talk to them. I wonder what Ricardo thinks of Groupon and if Frank has discovered match and whether Dena is on Facebook now. But mostly, I wish I could tell them again what I learned for myself: you may not believe it, but you won’t always feel this way.Names have been changed.• Katherine Heiny’s novel, Standard Deviation, is out now in paperback, priced £8.99 (4th Estate).

Ukad were forced to close the case earlier this year without reaching a conclusion because of missing medical records.The inquiry into Doping in Sport by parliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee ran in parallel with the Ukad inquiry, and the report was published in March. It included the claim that Team Sky had abused the anti-doping system to allow Wiggins – and possibly other riders – to use triamcinolone to prepare for the Tour de France. The report concluded Team Sky had “crossed an ethical line”. Team Sky strongly refuted both claims while Wiggins said at the time: “I strongly refute the claim that any drug was used without medical need.”Speaking to ITV4, Wiggins claimed the DCMS committee had not attempted to speak to him in person and added: “The report was fabricated stuff and it seems that they used parliamentary privilege to get it through legally.“If I’d murdered someone and was on trial, all that unsubstantiated evidence couldn’t be used – it would be lack of evidence, thrown out. But you use parliamentary privilege and you can produce a report, try and ruin someone and there you go.”The committee’s chair, Damian Collins, told the Observer it had followed up a suggestion from Wiggins’s then agent about meeting the committee but it had “never heard back.” Collins added that the material he supplied had been published on the committee website.Responding to Wiggins’s claim about the report, Collins added: “We received evidence from people who did not wish to be named, it was made clear where we relied on anonymous sources, and we trusted them as being credible. People can read the report and come to their own conclusions.”Wiggins also hinted strongly he believed there might be more information to emerge. “There are things that have come to light with this whole thing that we’ve found out since that are quite scary actually and it’s very sinister. We’re still not at the bottom of it, we’re finding new stuff out daily to do with the package that never was and all this stuff and it’s quite frightening actually.“We’re still working on it, still trying to piece it all together. Not a legal team, just other people coming to us now and saying: ‘You know this has happened, don’t you?’ We can debate TUEs and that’s one thing, but where it went after that with everything else – there is a film to be made there. I’d love it to all come out. Once it’s all stacked up and pieced together it’s quite shocking.”Wiggins was also asked to look back to his dispute at the 2012 Tour with Chris Froome, who is in contention to win this year’s race and who caused controversy by appearing to attack Wiggins, his team leader, in the Alps. Wiggins made it clear he has reflected on the episode since his initial, angry reaction. “I don’t think Chris was trying to attack me to drop me and win the Tour in 2012,” he said. “He was thinking he needed to secure his second place and he wasn’t as confident in his time-trialling as he is now. There is so much stress and pressure in this race that you’re on edge. I didn’t realise some of that until after.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d6e60ab6612d7c7e509a4bcfae786013517a32d/439_427_3045_1827/master/3045.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1e27bcb9d2f058f8cb1723c9a09e39b","title":"england india hockey world cup olympic park lee valley","story":"Six years ago Lily Owsley was watching inside the Olympic Park when Team GB won bronze in the women’s hockey event and further garlanded a glittering, gleaming summer for British sport. Now she may have played her part in continuing a similar feelgood factor, this time wearing an England shirt, and the intervention could hardly have been more timely.England were nearing a surprise defeat to India on the opening day of the World Cup and an expectant capacity crowd in Stratford looked likely to leave deflated. Owsley’s opportunistic finish six minutes before the end changed that and, while this was not the result Danny Kerry’s side wanted, the timing of the strike ensured they keep their momentum in a tournament for which their hopes are sky high.This was the kind of glorious sporting day this corner of east London has made its speciality. There is still something fuzzily reassuring about international events that take place here this time it was pink-clad Hockey Makers offering the welcome, London Pride filling the pint glasses and an array of visiting club groups adding to the chatter among a crowd that, by the\u0026nbsptime England’s game began, had hit a sellout 10,000. The wave of optimism around Gareth Southgate’s football team had sparked a willingness to be delighted once again but that went in tandem with something else, too.“Our vision is to become a nation where hockey matters,” the England Hockey chief executive, Sally Munday, had written in the official event guide. It is becoming that way, and that is largely because the success of both England and Great Britain is impossible to ignore. England won the women’s EuroHockey championship at this venue in 2015 the following year Great Britain became Olympic champions so memorably, both triumphs coming after defeating the Netherlands on penalties, and such cumulative excellence gives the sport an opportunity it has rarely had before.That is why it was so important England, ranked second in the world, did not falter against an India team they had beaten 6-0 in the Commonwealth Games bronze medal match three months ago. After a fast start they became frustrated by their opponents’ intense press and, by the time Neha Goyal scored for India 25 minutes in, the support had been reduced to near-silence. It took a ferocious response after half-time for England to turn the tide and when Owsley finally made her mark, erting the ball into an open goal after Ellie Watton had done superbly to salvage the latest in a seemingly endless stream of squandered penalty corners, the reward for a performance of growing conviction was just.“Instinctive, desperate, whatever you want to call it,” said Owsley, who scored in both of those finals against the Netherlands and, for a 23-year-old, has had a remarkably eventful career, of her leveller. “There was no minute in the game where I didn’t believe the goal was coming. They are a strong side and implemented some clever tactics against us but I felt our fitness and athleticism really began to show in the second half. We’re so happy to have a point on the board there’s a big difference between losing the first game and getting any kind of result. These tournaments are all about momentum.”It was enough to see England applauded off warmly and the tournament’s organisers could reflect on a spectacle that, starting earlier in the day when Germany outclassed South Africa en route to a 3-1 win that flattered their opposition, did the sport a service. It helps when clarity and candour are welcomed with such open arms. While VAR has caused ructions within football, partly due to a lack of communication with supporters about decision-making, hockey’s video referral system was shown in all its glory here.Teams are allowed one appeal per match, while the umpire can request a second opinion on goal decisions. When England, so dominant early on, thought they had earned a penalty stroke after Grace Balsdon’s penalty corner stuck an opponent’s foot near the line, India immediately requested a second look. To the backing of a Who Wants To Be A Millionaire-style suspense track, the video official got to work while the PA announcer explained exactly what was going on: that India felt the ball had struck a stick first and it was not the defender’s body that had prevented the goal. Their claim was upheld justice had been carried out with an entire stadium of spectators feeling fully in the loop.England made an appeal of their own relating to Goyal’s goal but that was swiftly ruled out the ease and openness of the process was notable all afternoon and added to the fresh, fast-moving feel of the entire event. Other bursts of audio included lines from Shampoo’s 1994 hit Trouble whenever a player received a green card frippery, perhaps, but on balance good-natured and unobtrusive.More of the same might give those watching this time round the impetus to follow in Owsley’s footsteps. “In that moment I felt a million miles away from them they seemed like superhumans,” she said of that 2012 squad, who would soon become friends and teammates. If England gather themselves to go all the way, it may be a fitting description."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ada755fd8ec24d869dcf32c42f9bc0ba785f1fc4/0_80_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aa905ab002f1905975162a58eff5f01","title":"jordan spieth kevin kisner tiger woods open golf carnoustie","story":"Whatever transpires during the closing round of this, the 147th Open Championship, we will always have Saturday. At 13 minutes past four the Open dynamic sharply shifted. We had been here before, several times a long, long time ago.Tiger Woods sat atop the leaderboard. Those who doubted that a Tiger Effect still lingers, a decade on from his last major win, surely had their scepticism doused. Woods’s position clearly registered with fellow players. Galleries flocked to watch the closing stages of the 42-year-old’s round. Social media lit up, including by way of commentary from golfers and professionals in others sports. At long last Woods was backing up excitement with performance. His problem was, Jordan Spieth seemed to take umbrage.“There’s a couple of holes that people may be standing 15, 20 deep on each side,” said Shaun Norris, Woods’s Saturday partner. “It’s like playing with a mythical creature. It doesn’t feel real.”As rather sums up recent times of the Tiger, he was to wobble on the closing stretch. A bogey at the 16th after a missed green at the par-three meant he had to settle for a 66. This, however, was his best major round since 2011. It was his lowest in the Open since the second round at Hoylake 12 years ago. Woods was to prevail on Merseyside from within touching distance of the lead he has a chance to replicate that triumph here. An outrageous piece of fortune at the 18th, when Woods’s ball seemed to behave contrary to gravity by bouncing away from rather than into the Barry Burn, suggested the golfing gods are on his side. Maybe they feel the 14-times major champion, an inidual once consumed by personal and physical chaos, has served his penance.“It’s certainly possible,” said a coy Woods when asked whether he believes Scotland will witness his most iconic victory of all. His attitude remained the same when asked his opinion about the scale of such an achievement. “We’re not there yet. I know what you’re trying to say in asking, but let me try and get there first. Then ask me again.”If one statistic easily works against Woods – he has never won a major from outside the top five after 36 holes, having been 29th in this one – there is the not insignificant matter of a young pretender. Spieth, regardless of poor pre-Open form, is the one competitor none of his peers fancy battling with in events such as these. A modern-day Woods, if you like. The defending champion, inspired by a wonderful eagle to start day three, signed for a 65 to share the clubhouse lead at nine under. That is four ahead of Woods.By close of play, as Spieth warned of an altogether different challenge on day four, he was joined at minus nine by Xander Schauffele and Kevin Kisner. The latter refuses to go away he has not scored higher than 70 over three rounds. Kevin Chappell, at seven under, is next in line.Should Spieth take the Claret Jug back to Texas, a major haul of four including a successful defence of the oldest one would mean he could be classed as one of the greatest to play the game. Spieth is only 24.Moving day was allowed to become fast-moving day because of calm Angus conditions. That is forecast to change on Sunday, with gusts perhaps exceeding 20mph. Spieth is among those who will rub their hands at the prospect. It was sensible for a remaining Open field, which started the third round separated by only nine shots, to take advantage of Carnoustie when it was as submissive as is ever likely to be the case.The leaderboard is brilliantly versatile. Spieth, Woods, Zach Johnson, Adam Scott, Webb Simpson, Justin Rose and Rory McIlroy are the major course-and-distance specialists to varying extents of course. For Kisner, Schauffele, Francesco Molinari, Chappell and Alex Noren there is the life goal of a maiden victory in one of golf’s big four. Noren’s 67, for a five-under total, was bittersweet given a bogey at the last after the Swede had clattered a stand with his approach\u0026nbspshot.Rose started the scoring show, his 64 matching the lowest round in a Carnoustie Open. The Englishman, who survived the cut by only one, cannot be discounted at four under. As attention – reams of it – erted towards the marauding Woods, Molinari posted a 65. The Italian’s aggregate is six under. Wins on both the European and PGA Tours this season, plus an uncannily accurate game from the tee, render Molinari a clear and present danger.Simpson tied Woods’s 54-hole score courtesy of a 67. McIlroy, Johnson, Tommy Fleetwood and Matt Kuchar complete the five-under contingent.Phil Mickelson’s 70 means he needs snookers to win the Claret Jug again from a starting Sunday position of minus one. “The game’s just hard for me right now,” said the 2013 champion. “I don’t feel like I’m playing bad, but just it’s not coming easy.”Woods once knew that feeling only too well. On a breathless Saturday afternoon he reminded all onlookers – and possibly himself – how good the alternative can be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a898e6f0778db09d7eda6b0e46893ebfa16467af/0_106_2300_1379/master/2300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b4f2f75a3d5891ae1fb2732c88e3d73","title":"lewis hamilton sebastian vettel german grand prix qualifying","story":"A day that had opened under glowering clouds ended with Lewis Hamilton wearing a similarly gloomy demeanour. The mechanical failure he suffered in qualifying for the German Grand Prix may prove to be crucial in his world championship battle with Sebastian Vettel who, in contrast, shone when the bright sunshine returned on Saturday afternoon to claim pole at Hockenheim.The failure was clearly unbearable for Hamilton and although it appeared the problem may have been induced through driver error, the team insisted he was not to blame. He nonetheless faces a formidable mental comeback for the race as well as the physical task of recovering from 14th on the grid. For Mercedes there must be concern they are suffering under pressure from Ferrari. They have had three costly mechanical issues this season, compounded by three strategic errors.Qualifying was a disaster for Hamilton, whose car stuck in gear at the end of Q1 following a loss of hydraulic pressure, and he came to a halt on the track. An effort to push his car back to the pit lane was to no avail and the world champion was left clearly distraught, kneeling beside his stricken ride on an exit road.“When I got out the car it was painful,” he said. “The first thought in my mind was to get the car back to the garage at all costs, so get out and push if you have to.”The incident occurred when he went wide exiting turn one, where his\u0026nbspcar took a hammering over the\u0026nbspkerbs, suggesting he had caused the damage. However, the team said the hydraulic failure caused the power steering to fail on his entrance to the corner, causing him to go so wide and jump so heavily.Hamilton confirmed the issue had already occurred when he entered the corner going over the kerb the drivers would usually take. “When I got to the exit kerb the power steering failed and when that happens the steering load is extremely heavy and pulls to the left,” he said. “I couldn’t slow down, so took those bumps after, but they didn’t do anything to the car.”The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, confirmed “definitely it was not Lewis’s driving”. Hamilton’s desperation was evident as he leapt from his ailing car and started pushing. But it was not to be and he sunk to\u0026nbsphis knees as the enormity of the blow hit home. Marshals ushered\u0026nbsphis\u0026nbspcar away.Hamilton took to Instagram to deliver a heartfelt riposte to the criticism he had received for supposedly causing the failure. “To those who take joy in seeing other people fail or suffer, I feel for you. Whatever is happening in your life to hold so much anger and hate, I pray that it passes and good things come to you,” he wrote, adding: “Nelson Mandela once said: We were not born with hate in our hearts, it’s something learnt over time. But if we can learn to hate then we can be taught to love for love is far easier and more natural to the human heart. God bless you. Now tomorrow, I can’t predict what’s to come. Good or bad I will die before I give in.”There were shades here of Mika Häkkinen at Monza in 1999 when, defending his title, he spun off and was left kneeling next to his car in tears. Vettel leads Hamilton by eight points in the world championship and, as it was for the Finn, the title\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspone likely to be decided by the finest of margins.Dropping points to the German here will be costly and Hockenheim will not prove nearly as accommodating as Silverstone, where Hamilton fought from the back to second.“It is not that easy to overtake here, it is one of the hardest tracks,” he said. “It’s not like Silverstone. I definitely don’t expect to be where I was at the\u0026nbsplast race.”Hamilton knew he was facing a hugely competitive Ferrari at Hockenheim and Vettel may well have been untouchable regardless of the British driver’s problem. His pole lap was imperious and clearly meant a lot to the German who grew up not 30 minutes from this corner of Baden-Württemberg.Vettel’s first run in Q3 secured provisional pole with a time of 1min 11.539sec, pipping Valtteri Bottas in\u0026nbspthe second Mercedes by just under\u0026nbsptwo-tenths.Bottas hit back strongly on the second hot run and delivered a fine lap to go quicker but Vettel had more and nailed a superlative run on his last lap to take the pole by two-tenths from the Finn in second with a time of 1.11.212. Ferrari’s Kimi Räikkönen was in third place.Vettel has won the German Grand Prix before but only at the Nürburgring, and he would dearly love to convert pole into a victory at what is truly his home race. “Today is definitely one of the best moments,” he said. “I have a mixed relationship with this track, we have been close in the past but it didn’t come together. To get the lap together here it means a lot in front of so many German tifosi.”He has every chance to please them again while Hamilton, who opened the weekend with the celebratory announcement of his new contract with Mercedes, has a difficult afternoon ahead. He might be buoyed to know Häkkinen went on to take the championship in 1999, a season that also went to the wire.

Froome, whose presence on the race became intensely controversial after ASO sought to ban him from competing, before clearing him to race, has been the focal point for most hostility.Copeland added that “Froome’s facing the risk of something happening every day. Chris told me that himself when we spoke recently. The other day on Alpe d’Huez, Vincenzo was behind Froome after he’d attacked. Chris managed to avoid the motorbikes and everything. Vincenzo went down.”As for Nibali’s crash and subsequent abandonment, Copeland said his team had “suffered huge damage” and the team’s lawyers were exploring possible legal action.“The fans invaded the road and the gendarmerie didn’t do what they should,” he said. “They also didn’t do anything about the people lighting flares. It’s not easy to control more than 600,000 fans as there were the other day but as they’re so powerful and so well organised, some things have to be managed firmly.”The tensions around Froome and Thomas appeared to lessen briefly on the winding wooded roads of the Ardèche and Lozère as an uneventful 14th stage climaxed with a breakaway victory for Omar Fraile of Spain, the first Tour stage win of his career.Fraile was home, hosed and celebrating well before the group of favourites began the steep final climb to Mende aerodrome. It took a speculative move from the unheralded Slovenian rider Primoz Roglic to light any fires, with Tom Dumoulin trying his hand 2km from the finish, but Thomas and Froome were able to respond as they closed on the airstrip finish overlooking Mende.Yet even on the 3km ascent to the aerodrome there was some damage inflicted. Adam Yates, who had hopes of a revival in the latter stages of the race, was among the first to crack while Romain Bardet and Mikel Landa were unable to keep pace with Thomas, Dumoulin and Froome, now firmly established as the three favourites for final victory in Paris.“It was a tough little final,” Froome said, “only a 3km climb, but explosive, tough. I think we saw the damage it did, even a short climb like that.“There were gaps opening up all over the place and a few seconds gained here and there with a few guys. All in all we are pretty happy with myself and Geraint, up front. Dumoulin seems to be our biggest threat.”Once again it was Thomas who appeared the most comfortable of the three favourites, with Froome being briefly dropped. “The goal was always to ride into this Tour and I think I timed it well,” Froome said. “I had a good block of recovery after the Giro and building up, into the Tour, was definitely the right thing to do for me.”Thomas also cited Dumoulin, the Giro champion in 2017, as the greatest threat to Sky’s hold on the race lead. “It’s impressive,” he said of the Dutchman’s performance. “He can really pace himself well.“He’s the world time-trial champion and he knows exactly how to ride whether its a 3km climb or Alpe d’Huez. You don’t know if he’s really suffering or just pacing himself. Fair play to him. It takes some balls to do that, especially when you have no teammates, but we’re just happy to be in the situation we are.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af203ec8d3082769a9874c8c4b554659b7c0e464/0_128_4974_2985/master/4974.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6db178bceae83ca5d8c4484adc7ba4bb","title":"tiger woods open contention 66 third round golf","story":"The cheer started on the 10th, when thousands of people broke out in one long, spontaneous shout of excitement as the ball landed hard by the pin. It’s been a long time since they have heard anything like it in Carnoustie, or anywhere else they play majors. It was unfamiliar, but unmistakable. The Tiger roar. It echoed around the links, and the rush of excitement spread wherever people were watching, or listening, to the golf. Tiger Woods was back, at last, and on the charge. By the time he had made it to the green, they had started chanting his name, beating out the syllables, “Tiger! Tiger! Tiger!”Even Woods was not sure he had this in him. Just this week he admitted “there were definitely points in time that I certainly thought I’d never play in this championship again”. And now here he was, at 4:15 on Saturday afternoon, top of the board, tied for the lead at six under par. It didn’t last. He dropped a shot, the only one he lost all day, when he made two bad putts at the par-three 16th. And then Jordan Spieth and the other late starters swept by him. But still, he finished in 66, five under, and come Sunday he will be in the hunt. Like he said: “It’s going to be fun.”Woods had been smouldering all week. He shot even par in both the first two rounds, when he played steady, shrewd, golf. He wanted to avoid unnecessary risks, but the upshot was he was not winning too many rewards either. He hardly trusted himself to use his driver all week, but has been playing irons off the tee, which is one reason why he is leading the field in driving accuracy this week, when he is ranked 154th over the rest of the season. It was all ever-so-sensible and safety-conscious, as if he would not play his hand until he had the perfect cards.The crowd have been pulling for him anyway, because at his age, after everything he has been through, there’s something of the underdog about him. And as he came down the first fairway there was a loud and affectionate shout of “Ga’wn Tiger! We got ya’ back in Glasgae”, which must be what passes for a compliment in some parts. But truth is Woods had not given them all that much to shout about on the first two days. And he played it pretty steady through the first few holes here, too, the two birdies he picked up at the 4th and 6th offset by one he missed from close range at the 2nd.Then Woods finally decided it was time to start gambling. At the 9th, he pulled out his driver. He had already used it at the 2nd and 6th, but this was the first time here. “We just thought that, with some of the pin locations, that if we missed on the correct side, that we could still have easy shots into the greens today,” he explained. Here he got lucky, the ball hopped over the bunker and fetched up in the rough. Then he raked in a long putt from 35ft, and rode the wave of good feeling right through the next two holes.At the 10th, Woods hit a nine iron to a foot from 140 yards or so. And on the 11th he drove the green, and took two putts for this third birdie in three holes. Woods burned up the turn, so hot that he sucked up the oxygen of everyone’s attention. His partner, poor old Shaun Norris, had never experienced anything like it. “It’s crazy,” Norris said, “Absolutely crazy to think so many people can follow a person. There’s a couple of holes that people may be standing 15, 20 deep on each side. I think best word to describe it all is the way Russell Knox put it, it’s like playing with a mythical creature. It doesn’t feel real.”Norris smoked through a couple of packets of fags just trying to keep his head in the game. He did well to shoot 69 in the circumstances. Woods made one more birdie at the par-five 14th, and then his run dried up. He had an outrageous piece of luck at the 18th, where his tee shot was one bad bounce away from the burn. It stopped right on the bank in thick seagrass rough. Then he made an 80-yard pitch, which he said he’d “practised in the backyard” and a clutch putt from five feet. “That was big for me,” he said, “just to not finish with two bogeys on the last three holes, playing as well as I did.”The par save meant Woods was in touch overnight. “At least I know that I will be there with a chance. They won’t be too far out of reach. If they get to double digits, I’m still only five back,” Woods said, “That’s certainly doable.” There’s a generation of golfers here at Carnoustie who have no idea what it’s like to tangle with Woods on the Sunday of a major. They are about to find out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b902d09f949a3f9ae13f30ead98642af68248f28/953_958_3289_1973/master/3289.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2da51cc44e69b389cb4113e6240f7b38","title":"zharnel hughes shara proctor tone british success anniversary games","story":"Not a bad week for the exiles of the British Overseas Territory of Anguilla. At the Müller Anniversary Games came shows of strength from two of the island’s athletic exports. Zharnel Hughes and Shara Proctor each delivered the kind of performances that suggest they can feature heavily in what is expected to be a hefty medal haul for Great Britain and Northern Ireland at next month’s European Championships in Berlin.Good going for an island of 14,764 people – almost exactly the same population as the Lancastrian town of Clitheroe. Hughes, who turned 23 last week, is putting up impressive numbers this summer over 100m. A personal best of 9.91sec in Jamaica briefly took him atop the 2018 rankings, while his mark of 9.93sec here made him runner-up behind American rival Ronnie Baker, whose victorious time of 9.90sec at the Diamond League meeting was a mere two-hundredths of a second adrift of the world-leading mark he now shares with compatriot Noah Lyles.The competition, both domestically and globally, is hotting up with no clear successor to Usain Bolt emerging. “Everyone wants to fill Usain’s shoes,” said Hughes, who is working under the past master’s long-time coach Glen Mills. “Honestly, I’m just trying to fill my own right now. I’m focusing on myself. Usain has paved the way for all of us, he’s a great athlete you know. For me it’s just about going out there and being Zharnel Hughes.”He was denied an opportunity to underline his present supremacy over the best of British due to the late withdrawals of Adam Gemili, Reece Prescod and Chijindu Ujah. All four, though, will wonder if they will be the one to dart below 9.87sec and topple Linford Christie from the perch of UK\u0026nbsprecord holder.That internal duelling has made Hughes all the sharper. As, he acknowledged, did the traumas inflicted when finishing first in the 200m at April’s Commonwealth Games, only to be disqualified when video replays suggested he had impeded Trinidad \u0026amp Tobago’s Jereem Richards. “I came back to Jamaica and I said to myself: ‘I’m never going to make something like that happen again.’ I applied myself and worked even harder. It’s nice to see that’s paying off.”Ditto for Proctor, whose career has ebbed and flowed since elongating the British long jump record to 7.07m when she took silver at the 2015 world championships in Beijing. The 29-year-old has battled injuries and the after-effects of a car crash in Birmingham last summer, but she leapt a season’s best of 6.91m to triumph in London, three centimetres ahead of Lorraine Ugen with the pair now eyeing up a British one-two at the Europeans.“The last two years were ridiculous,” Proctor said. “This year I’m hungry and determined to get back to where I was. I’m finally feeling like myself again so I can build on that going to the European Championships more confident than I was. It’s happening at the right time.“I’ve been patient and waiting for this moment all season. I’ve been consistent but not at the level I wanted so this was a move in the right direction.”Elsewhere, Matthew Hudson-Smith extended his cushion at the head of the European rankings by coming sixth in the 400m in 44.63sec with Abdalleleh Haroun winning in a Qatari record of 44.07.Eilidh Doyle, the British team captain at last year’s world championship in London, was left to ponder her readiness for Berlin by coming only seventh in the 400m hurdles on her comeback from a calf injury.However Tom Bosworth departed with energies fuelled and wallet filled to the tune of $15,000 (£11,416), courtesy of a world record of 10min 43.84sec in the 3,000m race walk. The 28-year-old Englishman has become a potent advocate for track and field’s forgotten discipline. “Race walking is not a glamorous event, it doesn’t get the big payroll so a day like today you make the most of it,” he said. “The incentive, the money, is there, but really it’s about putting on a show.”Sunday’s billing will likely be topped by Laura Muir’s attempt on Zola Budd’s 33-year-old British mile record while 2012 Olympic long\u0026nbspjump\u0026nbspchampion Greg Rutherford will hope to pull out the eight-metre effort required to merit one final appearance at the Europeans before\u0026nbspretirement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f23f491b97bfd55d4873936c1d7935f3ee0f5b7/734_699_4042_2425/master/4042.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b18fc66b523e3e758dc18f9976d6409e","title":"fun frivolity watching tour de france in pictures","story":"By the time the Tour de France finishes in Paris on 29 July, millions of fans will have lined the 2,000-mile route.

Jordan Spieth could become only the second player to win back-to-back Opens under the age of 25, after Young Tom Morris in 1868! Xander Schauffele, Kevin Kisner, Kevin Chappell, Francesco Molinari, Webb Simpson, Tommy Fleetwood, Rory McIlroy, Alex Noren, Zach Johnson and Matt Kuchar will have other ideas. Oh, so will a certain Tiger Woods, very much in the hunt for his 15th major title, a decade after his 14th at the 2008 US Open. Tomorrow promises to be something very special indeed. You’ll join us, won’t you? Great news! Until then, nighty night, and sweet dreams!Kisner rolls a perfectly weighted putt to the side of the hole. It was never dropping, always staying up on the left, but he’ll take that happily. It’s a par, and a 68. At -9, he’s got a share of the 54-hole lead with Jordan Spieth and Xander Schauffele, but having come home last he’ll be in the penultimate group with Kevin Chappell. Zach Johnson takes two putts for a par of his own and a disappointing 72.Johnson first. He’s coming in from 200 yards. And he swishes a lovely shot to 20 feet, a very decent result from there. Kisner is in prime position, but sends his 9-iron through the back. A slightly nervy one. He takes a deep breath as he sizes up a putt from the bottom of a shallow bank.Kevin Kisner needs to birdie the last if he wants to be in the final pairing tomorrow. He’s going the right way about it, creaming a 3-wood down the middle of the fairway. He’ll have a short iron in. That was brave considering he found the Barry Burn on the way to double-bogeying this hole yesterday. Zach Johnson also finds the fairway. He could do with something to make his tea taste better.Kevin Kisner, deep in the rough to the right of 17, takes his medicine and lays up. It’s the correct decision, because he then spins a chip to four feet, from where he saves his par. He remains at -9, and it’s been a bogey-free day for him so far. His partner Zach Johnson flies his second through the green, but chips back to six feet. Problem is, he’s left with a snaky downhill one, and it slips by the hole. The 2015 champion is -5 again.Up on 18, Tommy Fleetwood has a look at birdie from 15 feet, but his putt always stays high on the left. It’s a level-par 71. It hasn’t been his day, but he’s battled hard and done enough to stay in contention. He’s just four off the lead at -5, and with the wind likely to blow a bit tomorrow, anything could happen. His partner Pat Perez fell apart on the back nine: bogeys at 12 and 16, plus a double at 17. But he’s birdied the last to end the day with a three-over 74. He’s -2 for the championship.McIlroy’s chip up from the cabbage to the right of 18 just about reaches the green, but then his ball topples back down the bank. His putt up isn’t all that, leaving a squeaky four-footer to limit the damage to a bogey. He shows his grit, making the putt. That’s a 70, and he’ll be taking a run at this championship tomorrow from the chasing pack. Xander Schauffele will be right up there, though he rolls home a gentle right-to-left slider from the fringe at the back of the green for a feelgood birdie! That’s a 67 to go with yesterday’s 66, and the absurdly talented - and level-headed - 24-year-old from San Diego could well be in the final group tomorrow as he chases his maiden major!Tommy Fleetwood simply refuses to give up. He curls in his birdie putt on 17, and rises to -5 again. Since parring 10, he’s carded four birdies, two bogeys and a double. He’s an entertainer, and no mistake. Back on the tee, the co-leader Kevin Kisner flays an awful drive into deep nonsense down the right. He’ll have trouble reaching the green from there.Kevin Kisner finds the heart of 16, then leaves a long putt a good six feet short. But he strokes the par saver into the middle of the cup. Par for Zach Johnson too. Up on 18, Rory McIlroy goes for the green from the deep bunker. He pushes his shot further up the right of the hole, and sends his ball into a thick patch of rough. That’ll be a test to get up and down to save his par. Xander Schauffele’s wedge in, meanwhile, isn’t all that: it takes a hot bounce and topples off the back of the green. It’s not a million miles from the flag, but he should be having a really good look at birdie.Tommy Fleetwood responds to his latest setback by firing his second at 17 straight at the stick. He’ll have a look at birdie. On the 18th tee, Rory McIlroy drives into sand on the right, while Xander Schauffele bangs one up the middle. Up on the green, a birdie for Erik van Rooyen, and a level-par 71: he’s -4. Par for his playing partner Matt Kuchar: he signs for a 70 and ends the day at -5.Neither Xander Schauffele nor Rory McIlroy can find the 17th green in regulation. It costs the former, whose chip comes up eight feet short it doesn’t cost the latter, who bumps his six feet past the hole but makes the putt coming back. McIlroy stays at -6 Schauffele falls out of the lead and drops to -8. Back on 16, Tommy Fleetwood misses another short putt and slips to -4. Momentum is not his friend today.It’s been an up-and-down day for Tony Finau. He started off at -4, and that’s where he’s finished, having shot 71. But he’s made three bogeys, three birdies, a double bogey and an eagle along the way. Plus, having smacked his second at the last to four feet, he missed the short one. The mild-mannered Utah saint won’t win this Open, but another top-ten finish in the majors, after high finishes at the Masters and US Open, isn’t out of the question.Here’s a lovely stat: Zander Lombard’s eagle at 18 was the first-ever at that hole in Open Championship competition. He’s thrown his ball into the stand that’ll make a lovely souvenir for someone, a little piece of Carnoustie history.Here’s someone who will always go down swinging: Tommy Fleetwood. His Open bid looked to be heading south after that double on 12 and bogey at 13. But here’s his response: birdies at 14 and 15! He’s back in the mix at -5!Golf: a study in frustration and exhilaration. Zander Lombard has just bogeyed 17. So from the centre of the 18th fairway, the 23-year-old South African sends his second scampering towards the flag ... and into the cup for a closing eagle! It’s been a difficult day for the young man, who will chalk it up to experience, but he allows himself a huge smile as he raises both arms in triumph and soaks up the applause from the elated gallery. He’s signing for a level-par 71 he’s -4.Schauffele’s tee shot at the long par-three 16th nearly finds the greenside bunker front right ... but teeters on the top. He clips a delicate chip to four feet, setting up a brilliant par save. McIlroy’s tee shot dribbles down the swale to the right. He putts up, but weakly, and the six-footer he leaves himself dies off to the right. He drops back to -6. Momentum’s a slippery bugger. Birdies meanwhile for Kisner and Johnson on 14: the former joins the leaders at -9, while the latter starts the climb back up the leaderboard at -6.Two putts from distance for Jordan Spieth, and the defending champion posts a 65! He sits atop the pile at -9, alongside Xander Schauffele. His playing partner Kevin Chappell isn’t to be totally outdone: he birdies, the reward for a splendid approach to five feet. He cards 67. He’s -7, having come home in 32 strokes.Rory McIlroy and Xander Schauffele make their birdie putts on 15.  That’s given the leaderboard a good old shoogle! As for the Kuuuuuuuuuch thing ... Matt Kuchar’s just bumped in a chip from the bottom of a swale to the side of 16. It’s his third birdie since the turn! He’s on this leader board too!McIlroy sends his second at 15 pin high to ten feet. It’s a marvellous shot ... though Schauffele betters it by landing one four feet behind the flag. Up on 18, Spieth sends his drive into thick rough down the left. He’s about to take his second when bedlam erupts elsewhere, and there’s a chorus of Kuuuuuuuch. We’ll see what that’s all about soon enough. Spieth steps back, goes again, and lashes his second onto the green. What a shot that was! We’ve seen players hoick balls out of bounds and into the Barry Burn from there. But the reigning champion lands his ball bang slap in the middle of the green!Schauffele’s eagle putt stops one turn short of the cup. Rory’s misses on the left. Both tap in for slightly disappointing birdies, but you take what you can around Carnoustie, even on a benign day like this. Schauffele is a shot off the lead at -8 McIlroy rises to -6. Par meanwhile for Spieth on 17. And a word on his partner Kevin Chappell, who has responded well after dropping those shots at 6 and 9: birdies at 12 and 14 ensures the 32-year-old Californian - who has just the one PGA Tour victory to his name, last year’s Valero Texas Open - is still very much in the mix.A birdie at the last for Danny Willett. The 2016 Masters champion isn’t going to win this Open Championship, but after a couple of lean years he’s on his way back, which is wonderful to see. His round of 70 today goes with two other solid rounds of 69 and 71, and he’s -3 for the tournament. Zach Johnson doesn’t take advantage of his break. Two putts would have limited the damage to bogey ... but he misses a short one, and the double means that’s three shots gone in two holes. He’s -5. Kevin Kisner pars calmly, and he’s now three ahead of his playing partner at -8, but one behind the leader Spieth.A huge break for Zach Johnson. His ball has landed the other side of a gorse bush, and there’s a route to the green! He can lash his ball into the heart of the putting surface ... and that’s exactly what he does. Some good fortune for Xander Schauffele too: a drive at 14 that looked like dropping into a bunker stays out, and he can go for the green. He nearly hits the flag with his second! His partner McIlroy sends a drive over 400 yards down the track, and lifts a gentle wedge to eight feet. Meanwhile another bogey for Tommy Fleetwood: a second short putt missed in two holes, this time at 13, and he’s falling out of contention quicksmart. He’s -3.Jordan Spieth makes his birdie putt on 16! He takes sole ownership of the lead, no more than that stunning tee shot deserved! Meanwhile back on the par-five 14th, Matt Kuchar and Erik van Rooyen pepper the flag with their second shots, but the hole repels both eagle putts. Not sure how Kuchar’s in particular stayed out half of it disappeared at one point! They move to -4 and -5 respectively.From the rough down the left of 12, Zach Johnson snap-hooks his ball into terrible trouble. It smacks into the big video screen - I hope the R\u0026ampA have a good accidental breakage clause in their contents policy - and away towards some gorse. God speed, little ball. Meanwhile up on 18, Alex Noren wedges from the dropzone to five feet, and escapes with an outrageous bogey, having found the Barry Burn twice, but bounced out of it once. He’s earned that luck, though, Gary Player style, because despite the final-hole bogey he’s round in 67. He’s -5 and right in the mix!Jordan Spieth is a sensational player. Like that’s breaking news! Still, his tee shot on the lengthy par-three 16th is nothing short of outrageous, a long iron whipped straight at the flag, holding the small portion of the green near the flag and stopping softly. He’ll have a ten-footer for a birdie, on a hole most players struggle to make par. To illustrate its difficulty: Tom Watson had five goes when he won here in 1975, failing every time. Even if he misses his birdie putt, he’ll be gaining on plenty in the field with par!Jordan Spieth misreads his short birdie effort at 15. The ball was always going off to the right. He remains at -8, tied with Kevin Kisner. A double bogey for Tommy Fleetwood on 12, and the European number one really is out of sorts today. He’s -4.Spieth lags his long eagle effort at 14 holeside, then knocks in what’s left for birdie. He joins Kevin Kisner at -8 ... but Zach Johnson’s no longer there, because he lets a short one slip by at 11. Then at 15 he fires his second straight at the flag. He’ll have a 12-footer for the outright lead! Meanwhile the komik kutz kontinue for Alex Noren on 18: having taken his drop, he carves his third towards the Barry Burn further up the hole. The ball twangs off the far face of the creek, rebounds backwards, onto the grandstand on the right, and back into filth. Strong shades of Jean van de Velde.Alex Noren had stormed up the leader board ... but he’s sent his tee shot at 18 to the right and into the Barry Burn. More European pain in 12, where Rory yips a tiddler for par and drops back to -5. And trouble for Erik van Rooyen at the par-three 13th. He sends his tee shot into sand - the pin’s tucked behind a bunker, and it was a very aggressive line. Nearly, but not quite. He’s right up against the face without much green to play with. He quits on the splash, and he’s left in the trap. He nearly holes the second effort, but that’s another shot gone. Twenty holes without a bogey, then two come along at once. It’s not often you can use the old London Buses quip about bogeys at Carnoustie, but there you go, fill your boots.A huge break for Jordan Spieth on the par-five 14th. His drive looks like it’s going to be swallowed by a big bunker down the left. If it goes in, he’ll have to chip out sideways. But it somehow stays up on the left, allowing him to smash his second into the heart of the green. He’ll have a look at eagle from 30 feet or so. Meanwhile birdie for Tommy Fleetwood on 11, and after a frustrating run of pars, it’s finally happening again for Southport’s finest! He’s -6.Thorbjorn Olesen has been thoroughly refreshed by that eagle on 14. He fires an iron from 200 yards straight at the flag. It looks for all the world like it’s going to trundle slowly into the hole, but somehow lips out. He’ll knock what’s left in for birdie that takes him to -4. Suddenly, he’s back in contention! Up on 17, Alex Noren rolls in a birdie putt from off the green, and he’s -6. But it’s Erik van Rooyen’s first bogey in 20 holes, the punishment for failing to hit a ten-foot putt on 12 by one inch. Harsh. He’s -5.Rickie Fowler’s day started to turn sour with that out-of-bounds triple-bogey on 6. Another dropped shot at 8. Another bogey at 12. But he’s rekindled his now-much-slimmer chances with eagle at 14. He’s -2. Eagle for his playing partner Thorbjorn Olesen, as well. He’d been heading in the wrong direction also, so that keeps his hopes alive: -3. Meanwhile Xander Schauffele passes up a golden chance for birdie at 11, but his partner Rory McIlroy makes no mistake from 12 feet. A third birdie of the day, and after a terribly sluggish start, the 2014 champion is beginning to regain some momentum.Kevin Kisner sends a delightful second into 9. He’s left with an eight footer for another birdie, but his putt lips out on the right. He turns in 34 and smacks the head of his putter in frustration. Don’t be too hard on yourself: you’re still co-leader of this famous old tournament. Par for Zach Johnson too. They’re -8. Adam Scott rattles a long birdie putt across 16 and into the cup. He’s -4.Rory McIlroy and Xander Schauffele both set up good birdie chances on 10 with big drives and gentle wedges. Both give them up with distinctly average putts. They remain at -5 and -7 respectively. On 18, Webb Simpson nearly holes out from a greenside bunker, but the up and down saves his par, and he signs for a 67. He ends the day at -5, and his impressive 2018 continues apace.Two poor shots by Jordan Spieth up 12, and he’s in a deep bunker well short of the green. He’s faced with a long sand shot ... and caresses a stunning effort to five feet. He tidies up to remain at -7. That’s a superb save. His partner Kevin Chappell, having done much to negate that triple-birdie start with bogeys at 6 and 9, races in a long one to move back to -5. And Pat Perez nearly salvages a par on 9 with a 25-foot left-to-right slider, but it horseshoes out: he drops back to -5. Matt Kuchar, vanquished last year at Birkdale by the absurd brilliance of Jordan Spieth, will be dreaming of another tilt at the title. It wasn’t looking great for a while: bogeys at 4, 5 and 8 sent him clattering down the leaderboard, but a birdie at 10 brings him back to -3. And yes, of course he’s been smiling all the way through, whatever. Another birdie for his partner Erik van Rooyen, too, his second of the day. He’s -6.A smidgen of disappointment at the end of Francesco Molinari’s round. He whip-cracks his second at 18 straight at the flag, the ball stopping six feet short. But he tugs the birdie putt. Still, he’s tapping in for a sensational 65: out in 33, back in 32. He’s -6, and the runner-up in last year’s PGA will be hoping to go one better in this particular major tomorrow. He’s in a seriously rich vein of form, and he’s got a chance!Zach Johnson rattles in another biggie with the flat stick. Just 30 feet or so this time, but the birdie at 7 brings him level with Kevin Kisner, who pars, at the top: -8. Back-to-back birdies for Alex Noren at 13 and 14. He’s -5. And a birdie for Jordan Spieth at 11, the reward for knocking his second to six feet: he’s a shot off Johnson and Kisner at -7.Tiger talks to Sky! “It seemed like everybody was shooting six, seven under par. I figured I needed to do the same. There were quite a few guys five or six under par after 12 holes. The pins were definitely gettable, they were quite friendly to us, so I had to attack. The up and down at 18 kept me in the fight. Some guys will get to -10 today, and five shots are achievable. I didn’t want to drop that last shot. Today’s was one of the better rounds I’ve played, I had control of my ball, which is not easy to do on a links course.”You may have noticed Pat Perez creeping further up the standings. That’s because he’s just drained a 50-footer across 7 for his third birdie in four holes! Brilliant from the late-bloomer from Phoenix, Arizona. The 42-year-old won the CIMB Classic this year, only his third Tour title in a long career, but his second in the last two years. Don’t rule him out, because he’s playing as though he doesn’t give a solitary flying one. Just for the love of the game. He’s freewheeling around Carnousite and it’s great to watch!MONSTER PUTT ALERT! Scrub that leader board! Stop the clocks! Nothing’s happened for Zach Johnson today yet. Apart from that bogey on 4. And he’s only on the front of the huge green at the par-five 6th. The best part of 100 feet from the hole, uphill, over a couple of mounds, with a right-to-left swing thrown in. And in it rattles! The crowd go wild! The 2015 champ doesn’t know what to do, so just pulls his hat over his eyes and smiles in disbelief. Did that really happen?! He’s the new co-leader ... for about a minute, because his partner Kisner takes a more realistic two putts from distance for his birdie, and he’s now top on his own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42c7d848eedfeb44c7e06037f475ea94d3934b90/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=688ff991c0d1b41024eb36bbe607ea5f","title":"why donegal is the coolest place on the planet","story":"The long-overlooked north-west corner of Ireland has finally started getting its dues. In 2017, Donegal even topped National Geographic’s list of the coolest places on the planet. Anna Hart rounds up the 10 best things to do on a Donegal road trip Ireland’s most rugged and ravishing county has been a much-loved retreat for artists, bohemians, outdoorsy types and holidaying families for decades, but it’s only now that the rest of the world is waking up to the charms of traversing Donegal by car. Dramatic, secluded beaches, craggy coastlines, soaring peaks, shimmering lakes, verdant valleys and time-warp harbours – all dotted with atmospheric country pubs and quaint seafood restaurants – recently propelled this north-west county to the top of National Geographic Traveller’s Cool List. “It’s a warm-hearted place, but wilderness always feels just a stone’s throw away,” says National Geographic Traveller editor Pat Riddell. “And it is wilderness – world-class wilderness.” It’s definitely the coolest place on the planet right now if you’re a Star Wars fan. The region’s Inishowen peninsula was spectacularly showcased in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, with Malin Head being used to represent bits of Luke Skywalker’s isolated retreat, planet Ahch-To. This only added to the buzz around this long-overlooked corner of Ireland, further embellishing its hip credentials and making it the stuff of road-trip dreams. If you’re taking your car to Ireland by ferry to explore the attractions of Donegal, make sure you hop out at the following must-do spots.Sink a pint at McGrory’sUnassuming but atmospheric, 1920s family-run McGrory’s hotel in Culdaff has long been a local favourite, thanks to its open fires, a dazzling range of Irish craft beers and traditional music sessions. So much so that Daisy Ridley and the Star Wars crew had a night out there around filming, leading to a steady stream of Star Wars-struck visitors. Making the most of the welcoming atmosphere and seafood-heavy menu is now even more of a must.Swap four wheels for two While Donegal rewards road-trippers with sublime coastal scenery, isolated castles, private estates and ancient forests, it’s also a great spot to jump on a bike and blast some of that Atlantic sea breeze into your lungs. The peninsula at Horn Head, forming part of Sheephaven Bay, is perhaps the most scenic of all the Donegal peninsulas, where the cliffs rise to 180 metres (600ft) on the ocean side and provide breeding grounds for seabirds such as the European shag and razorbill. The Hornhead loop can be walked or driven, but biking is the best way to drink it all in, speeding past quartzite cliffs, mud flats, dunes and the salty New Lake area, complete with exceptional views of the Atlantic Ocean.Scale Mount ErrigalThe stark, striking quartzite mass of 751-metre Mount Errigal looms as you head east on the N56 from Gweedore. This is the tallest peak in County Donegal, and along with Mweelrea, is considered one of the most satisfying climbs in the county. Alternatively, drive to the coast and take a bracing walk at the highest sea cliffs in Europe – Slieve League. They stretch 600 metres (2,000ft) above the Atlantic Ocean at the highest point, with impressive views of the rugged coastline and Donegal Bay. Lose yourself in Letterkenny With a population of nearly 20,000, Letterkenny is Donegal’s most populous town, a confident and vibrant former market town famous for gothic-style St Eunan’s Cathedral – and its Hindu temple too. Donegal County Museum, housed in a 19th-century workhouse building, is a great place to get clued up on the county’s former industrial history, and, just south-west of town, the Newmills Corn and Flax Mills have a huge working waterwheel powered by the River Swilly.Picnic at Glenevin waterfallGlenevin waterfall is found at the top of a short hike of just over a mile through the woods in Clonmany, with nicely landscaped picnic areas, footbridges and stepping stones adding to the magic of this beautiful spot. Stock up on sandwiches, quiches and sweet treats at Claire The Bakers in Carndonagh beforehand.Explore Malin Head on the Inishowen peninsulaMalin Head, Ireland’s most northerly point, offers spectacular views, and the northernmost tip, Banba’s Crown, is one of the most photographed spots in the county. Sip a flat white from the Caffe Banba coffee truck (which also has a standalone cafe in Carndonagh) and see if you can spot scenery that made an appearance in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.Take a trip to Tory IslandTory Island, just 8.5 miles off the mainland, is an island steeped in history and folklore, where Irish is spoken and the locals elect a king, who acts as the community spokesperson. Seventy-four-year-old musician Patsy Dan Rodgers has been king for two decades now, ruling over this island of 150 inhabitants, a single road, one church, one grocery store, one lighthouse, one hostel and a social club.Surf the AtlanticThe Wild Atlantic Way is studded by tiny surf towns and beaches that have become legendary among the European surf community. Bundoran is widely considered one of the best surfing spots in Europe, and is fantastic for all kinds of water sports and horseshoe-shaped Magheraroarty Strand and sand dune-backed Ballyhiernan Bay are both suitable for windsurfing and surfing. Beginners can get to grips with the sport at Inishowen, which has some of the most consistent waves in Ireland, due to its exposure to rolling swells. Its long stretches of golden sandy beaches make for safe surfing conditions and a pleasant environment for newbies.Cook your catchCatch and cook your own dinner on a fishing trip with An Duanai Mara Boat Charters, based in the fishing town of Killybegs. On these deep-sea angling trips (combined with sightseeing trips around Donegal Bay), you’ll have the chance to reel in a cod, ling or turbot, watch the skipper fillet it, and then feast on it at nearby Kitty Kelly’s restaurant.Hike Glenveagh national parkGlenveagh national park is one of six in Ireland, encompassing some 16,000 hectares in the heart of the Derryveagh mountains. These lands were managed as a private deer forest before becoming a national park in 1975, and this is now bona fide wilderness, home to a lot of indigenous wildlife and rare plant species.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

Here a cancer expert and physicist argues that it misrepresented the research and that fears are ill-founded • Last week’s article: The inconvenient truth about cancer and mobile phonesLast week the Observer published an article by Mark Hertsgaard and Mark Dowie on a disturbing topic – the idea that telecoms giants might collude to suppress evidence that wireless technology causes cancer. The feature was well written, ostensibly well researched, and deeply concerning. Its powerful narrative tapped into rich themes our deep-seated fears about cancer, corporate greed, and technology’s potentially noxious influence on our health. It spread rapidly across social media – facilitated by the very object on which it cast doubt.Yet as enthralling as Hertsgaard and Dowie’s narrative might be, it is strewn with rudimentary errors and dubious inferences. As a physicist working in cancer research, I found the authors’ penchant for amplifying claims far beyond that which the evidence allows troubling. And as a scientist deeply invested in public understanding of science, I’ve seen first-hand the damage that scaremongering can do to societal health. While it is tempting to rage into the void, perhaps this episode can serve as a case study in how public understanding of science can be mangled, and what warning signs we might look out for.The opening paragraph lays bare a seemingly astounding conclusion – the US’s National Toxicology Program concluded that mobile phones cause cancer. This is, to put it charitably, a devious extrapolation. The study in question observed that rats exposed to intense radiofrequency (RF) had slightly higher rates of brain cancers relative to the control group. But far from being a smoking gun, the flaws in this study paint a muddled picture. First, the preprint reveals that the rats in the RF-exposure group lived significantly longer than those controls. As cancer is primarily correlated with age, it’s not surprising the longer-lived group would get more cancer, but it would be equally daft to presume RF increases life based on these results.As other authors have pointed out, the NTP results raise several questions about methodology and interpretation but certainly do not show RF leads to cancer. Nor could a study in isolation answer this question – studies are essentially single data-points. What matters is whether consistent trends are seen across many studies. Indeed, a multitude of studies have been performed to this end, and as the World Health Organisation states, there has been no evidence of detrimental health effects: “A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use.”Instead of rats, we might consider human evidence. The 13-country Interphone study examined phone usage in more than 5,000 patients with brain tumours, concluding there was no causal relationship between phone use and brain tumours. And while one would expect cancer rates to increase with usage were this a cause, the dose-response curve betrayed no signs of correlation. In some instances, it registered a decrease in risk with increasing usage. Curiously, the authors are aware enough of Interphone to cite it, but utterly twist its finding by stating the study “linked wireless radiation to cancer”. This stands in stark contrast to Interphone’s actual conclusion: “Overall, no increase in risk of glioma or meningioma was observed with the use of mobile phones.”Other studies have been similarly robust a Danish cohort study followed 358,403 people for 27 years, again finding no link between phone usage and tumour rates. The scientific consensus to date is that there is no evidence linking cancer to mobile phones. To ignore strong evidence against a conjecture while inflating weak studies is textbook cherry-picking, where data that might contradict a particular hypothesis is jettisoned, and only evidence fitting the desired story retained. This is antithetical to science, where the totality of evidence must be assessed in concert.This isn’t surprising in one respect. We are surrounded by a symphony of invisible light, of which our eyes detect only a tiny sliver. The energy carried by packets of light is proportional to the frequency of that light, a finding that won Albert Einstein his Nobel prize. High-frequency light has sufficient energy to break apart chemical bonds, causing DNA damage. This is “ionising” radiation, exploited in x-ray therapy where high-energy photons are marshalled to kill tumour cells. Ionising radiation can also lead to cancer high-energy ultraviolet radiation, for example, induces skin cancer through sustained DNA damage.By contrast, RF (and indeed, visible light) are notoriously low energy and non-ionising, lacking the ability to wreak havoc on DNA. For cancers to form, a carcinogen needs to damage DNA – unless some extremely novel mechanism were to be discovered, it is extraordinarily unlikely that RF could cause cancer.Hertsgaard and Dowie insinuate the telecoms industry is obfuscating scientific inquiry, drawing parallels with contemptible efforts by big tobacco to negate public acceptance of the link between smoking and cancer, and attempts by fossil-fuel groups to enforce a sense of public confusion and inertia over climate change. It might not seem too much of a stretch to imply the telecoms industry would engage in similarly odious behaviour, but this reasonable edifice crumbles under even cursory reflection.The crucial difference is that there was an abundance of strong evidence linking smoking to cancer, and for anthropogenic climate change too. Unlike RF-radiation, smoking is a clear carcinogen, linked to cancer experimentally as early as the 1920s. Subsequent experiments echoed this, showing clear causal links to cancer. By 1953, the weight of scientific evidence linking cancer to smoking was overwhelming. Similarly, climate-change is supported by evidence so strong as to be virtually incontrovertible. The scientific consensus is that our climate is changing rapidly, with the unmistakable fingerprints of human meddling making it clear we’re responsible for rising global temperatures. The mechanism behind this has long been known - French Polymath Joseph Fourier hypothesized human impact on climate in 1827, with effects of greenhouse gases demonstrated experimentally by Irish Physicist John Tyndall in 1864.With RF, however, the scientific evidence points to a conclusion totally at odds with what the authors postulate. The analogy to industry bamboozling the public to ignore findings doesn’t hold if there is no strong scientific consensus from which to deflect, rendering it cynical or ignorant to equivocate the twain. This is not a case of an industry trying to distract from an inescapable scientific conclusion – the reality is there is nothing of substance from which to deflect.The authors conclude by stating a “lack of definitive proof that a technology is harmful does not mean the technology is safe, yet the wireless industry has succeeded in selling this logical fallacy to the world”. Such a statement raises questions regarding their grasp of the term “logical fallacy”. The onus here is on the authors to prove their assertion – it is sheer logical contortion to present a lack of evidence as a superficial supporting argument. That the authors attribute this lack of evidence for their claims to the machinations of a nebulous big telecoms is indicative of a mindset more conspiratorial than sceptical.The conspiratorial bent is relevant – misconceptions about wireless technology have long perpetuated. Like all the most enduring myths, fears over new technologies are built upon a tiny kernel of truth, hideously distorted. There is no shortage of websites and groups alleging all manner of damage from wifi. Disputing these narratives tends to result in personal besmirchment, with questioners labelled either a pawn of the industry or witless dupe.While constant monitoring of an emergent technology is laudable, current evidence contradicts the hypothesis that mobile phones increase the risk of cancer. Scaremongering narratives may be more alluring than the less sensational, scientific findings, but they are not harmless. We need only look at any vaccine panic to see the cost in human life when superstition outpaces science. In an age where misinformation can perpetuate rapidly, it can be difficult to parse fact from fiction, but it’s imperative that we hone our scientific scepticism rather than succumb to baseless panics – our very wellbeing depends on it.Dr David Robert Grimes (@drg1985) is a physicist, cancer researcher, and science writer based at Queen’s University Belfast and the University of Oxford, and is also a recipient of the Sense About ScienceNature Maddox prize "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f06a2a0a43b08fbe97084604c72b6d33792856/24_148_1860_1116/master/1860.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=755742a76cc9d1e9bd649504faab1b88","title":"buffy the vampire slayer to be remade 21 years after first episode","story":"Unnamed black actor will reportedly take role filled by Sarah Michelle Gellar in 1990sTelevision’s habit of twinning teenagers with vampires, which became so voguish more than 20 years ago with the success of the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, just will not lie down and die.The show, which starred Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy and the English actor Anthony Head in the role of charming “watcher” Rupert Giles, is now to be re-booted, it has been announced. According to entertainment industry journal the Hollywood Reporter, an unnamed black actor has been lined up for the lead role in a “contemporary” version of the story.The drama, created by Joss Whedon, was first broadcast in 1997 and won devoted followers around the world, following as it did in the supernatural wake of the teenage vampire film The Lost Boys, a cinematic hit with young audiences a decade earlier in 1987.When Buffy finished battling the undead in 2003, the Twilight series of films based on the books of Stephanie Meyer took up the ghostly reins.Whedon will executive produce the series, penned by Agents Of SHIELD writer Monica Owusu-Breen.However, it seems not everyone is welcoming the reboot.Writer Michael Patterson tweeted: “I’m sorry but literally nobody asked for a Buffy reboot. A revival … yes. But not a reboot. The original TV series told a perfect story and did everything it set out to do (revolutionising television in the process). Why would you mess with such greatness?”Gellar, who played vampire-battling high school student Buffy, recently marked 21 years since the first episode of the show by sharing snaps from behind the scenes. She told Entertainment Weekly: “It’s the ultimate metaphor: horrors of adolescence manifesting through these actual monsters. It’s the hardest time of life.”Head recently landed a role as a smooth-talker in Radio 4 soap the Archers.The new series will have a least one new competitor when it arrives. Sky has already released a trailer for the fantasy drama A Discovery of Witches, a series based on Deborah Harkness’s All Souls trilogy of novels.Scholarly witch Diana Bishop is to be played by Teresa Palmer, while Matthew Goode takes the role of the enigmatic vampire Matthew Clairmont, her romantic interest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0734ab92f254ad7d59a74d755f011c04c5868333/73_16_3482_2089/master/3482.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85b8413956021efc02c6e65c6cf24c70","title":"love island","story":"Within a villa full of liars and love rats is something to be gleaned about friendship, race and the way men and women communicateThese are, I think we can all agree, testing times for Britons. Cracks have appeared in previously harmonious communities. Families have been torn down the middle. We are ided, split between those who watch Love Island (ITV2, 9pm, Sunday to Friday) and those who do not.This summer has seen my first sojourn to the land of weirdly hairless bodies and Instagram-endorsed dreams. Love Island is, it turns out, the entertainment equivalent of crack cocaine. To immerse yourself in such synapse-sucking froth is to cross a line that cannot be uncrossed. It requires commitment on an absurd scale – an hour or more, six nights a week – to keep up with the bed hopping, the tear-stained confessionals and the curious campfire coupling rituals. And yet I am deliciously, unapologetically hooked.I have, of course, listened to the carping of its detractors. What does Love Island have to teach us about life, they wail? Why would you want to watch these self-obsessed peacocks when you could spend that time with a book, or with your loved ones, or tortuously pondering future trade relations with the EU. But that would have been to deprive myself of the sweetly blossoming love affair between Dani Dyer, offspring of actor-turned-Brexit analyst Danny, and Jack, an upstanding pen salesman from Orpington. I would have missed watching the preternaturally ripped personal trainer, Adam, working his way around the villa like a dose of herpes, and inadvertently educating the nation on gaslighting. I wouldn’t have seen pseudo-spiritual dim-bulb Eyal tutor Hayley in how to pronounce his name (“Eeeeeeeee-yal?” “No, Aay-yaaaaaal”. “So Eeeeee-yaaaaal?” “No, Aaayaaa ... OK, whatever. Eeeeeyal”) or witnessed the serially shat-upon Laura delivering a blunt apology to Megan: “Our friendship is over. But you’re not a slag.”And don’t try telling me I haven’t learned anything in two months of hothoused carnality. Had I never watched Love Island, I wouldn’t have grasped the bureaucratic nature of modern courtship (“You tick all the boxes,” says absolutely everyone) or known about “nude” evening wear, which may or not be the product of a fashion industry practical joke. I wouldn’t have clocked that sensitive A\u0026ampE doctor Alex has all the charisma of a pot plant. Indeed, were a pot plant to have been deposited in the villa, he would have delivered the same speech that he’s made about every woman towards whom he feels a disturbing sense of entitlement: “This houseplant has a really nice vibe, and a natural look. I think we’ve made a connection and I can see a lot of potential with this plant so, yeah, I’m excited to see what happens.”In the annals of reality TV, Love Island is far from real. Yet there is something to be gleaned here about friendship, race (the most dispiriting element so far has been the sidelining and eventual self-exile of Samira), and the way men and women communicate. This is a place where liars and love rats get called out and prejudices are exposed. Love Island delivers its own brand of justice even while dealing in daft fantasy. Best pull up a sun lounger and enjoy it while it lasts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca359014de9d9de2aa7cf74c75a3def38fb65c28/0_82_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b1fa2f4f6cb3dce9cdc0a71444adc18","title":"michael che street kid emmy host saturday night live","story":"Ten years ago he was hawking T-shirts on Manhattan street corners. Today Michael Che is a star of Saturday Night Live and the man chosen to host this autumn’s Emmys, America’s most prestigious TV awards.Before that, Che, one of the hottest tickets on the US comedy circuit, is set to unleash his distinctive brand of standup in Britain during a handful of exclusive shows starting next week. But don’t expect a barrage of jokes about Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Brexit. “I know this is going to sound weird from a guy that does fake news on TV, but I really don’t like political jokes,” Che says.Instead, his comedy centres on what he calls “the human element of situations” – observations and jokes about issues such as race, drugs and crime, but told through social situations and ordinary people. “I think that’s way more interesting than politics,” he says.The youngest of seven children raised in New York’s Lower East Side “before it became gentrified with cupcake stores”, Che spent years immersed in the underbelly of the city’s housing projects. It’s at the heart of his streetwise style of comedy. As a teenager, he had no ambitions to become a comedian he rarely even watched comedy on TV. Sport and art were his thing, and that was how he ended up selling his hand-painted T-shirts on the streets of SoHo.“I’d look at your watch, and I could tell if you wanted to spend 25 bucks or only 10. I guess I was always trying to read people,” he recalls.The fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger once offered him a job after seeing one of his creations. Che met Hilfiger in his plush offices, where Hilfiger paid him $1,000 for the T-shirt, believing he’d spotted raw talent. But Che declined the job offer.It was around this time, in his mid-20s, that he started going to open-mic comedy shows, not to participate but just to observe. Something about the “anything goes” nature of standup attracted him. He joined the audience every day for weeks before plucking up the courage to have a go himself.“I was like: I might not be as good as the good ones but I could be as bad as the bad ones, and they’re not afraid to be bad, so why am I? So I tried it, and I immediately left the stage and went to another one because I wanted to try it again and again.“It was like Candy Crush – I couldn’t stop if I wanted to,” he says. He spent the next four years racking up gigs, often multiple times a night. “The more you’re on stage the more comfortable you are, the more you’re free to take chances.” Talent spotters and fellow comedians started to take notice of his laid-back, languid style of delivery and his poignant gags about life in the poorer parts of the city.The big break came in 2014 when Che was hired as a correspondent on Jon Stewart’s satirical The Daily Show. Just three months later he was poached by Saturday Night Live. And at the end of last year he became one of its head writers – the first time in its 43-year history that the show has had a black person in that role.Standup comedy and live TV are not a million miles apart, Che says. Scripts are being written while the show is on air, reacting to breaking news. And like his one-man shows, he adjusts his performance according to the mood of the audience.“It’s exciting because when it’s clicking it’s maybe the best thing you can see on TV, next to sports.” Now 35, Che says his family is “amused” by his fame but doesn’t profess to understand it. “If my mom saw me hosting the Emmys, or she saw me in a McDonald’s commercial, she wouldn’t know which one is better. She’s just happy that I’ve got a job and I’m not sleeping on a bench.”Sleeping rough is what a lot of people he grew up with are doing, though, Che says. “Worst-case scenario, I was supposed to be dead at 25, you know, or selling drugs or in jail. I think that realisation has helped because you never let this kind of stuff – the success – get to you. You never let it seem more important than it is.”It’s that down-to-earth, real-life edge that Che tries to inject into his scriptwriting for Saturday Night Live. In one of his most popular sketches, for example, Tom Hanks played a Trump supporter pitted against African Americans in a quiz about black street jargon. In the end, they had more in common than they might have believed.“I think people want to laugh about the things that make them similar, not what makes them different. I mean, the funniest part is always the part that everybody can connect with,” he says.Che is an outspoken critic of Trump but says that, as an African American raised in the projects, he often feels he has more in common with white Trump voters than with white Upper West Siders. Perhaps as a result, he has sometimes rubbed up America’s white middle class the wrong way. Last year he upset the liberal milieu of Boston by saying their city was the most racist place he had ever visited.He is unrepentant, but more cautious in his social media posts these days, and has stopped using Twitter. “For some people, your jokes are gonna suck no matter what,” he says.But Che knows that going down badly with the glitterati at the Emmys in September is not an option. Award shows can often live or die by how well they are fronted.He and co-host Colin Jost will start writing jokes in the next couple of weeks. “We’ll just try to be funny, we’re not going to try and reinvent the wheel,” he says.It all might seem a long way from a makeshift T-shirt stall on the corner of Wooster and Prince Streets, but Che insists that he doesn’t let it get to him. Otherwise he’d never get out of bed in the morning.“Anyway, I know that this is all fleeting – none of it is real. So what have I to be afraid of?”Michael Che will be at Gorilla, Manchester, on 29 July and Union Chapel, London, on 30 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/965c0708526b68214306623629beabbdcfb46dd9/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6234fed0729f7bd4157d3412467c29f7","title":"missouri mass casualty incident after tourist boat capsizes on table lake","story":"Seventeen people lost their lives when tourist boat capsized on Table Rock lakeA survivor who lost nine of her relatives when the duck boat they were travelling aboard on an US lake has said the captain told passengers not to bother putting on life jackets.Tia Coleman told the Indianapolis television station WXIN that she and a nephew were the only survivors among 11 relatives on the boat, which went down in bad weather on Table Rock lake in Branson, Missouri, on Thursday, killing 17 people.Coleman said she had lost all her children in the deadliest accident of its kind in the US in nearly two decades. She also said the captain had told passengers they would not need life jackets. By the time of the accident it was too late, she said.Ripley Entertainment, the owner of Ride the Ducks of Branson, was yet to respond to Coleman’s claims on Saturday.The company’s president, Jim Pattison, told CBS on Friday that the boats had life jackets on board but passengers were not legally required to wear them. It has been claimed that Coleman’s family would not have been on the ill-fated trip but for a ticket mix-up.Tracy Beck, of Kansas City, Missouri, said she recalled the family members waiting in line. After they stopped for a picture, she said a ticket inspector realised that they should have boarded at a different location and reassigned them.The Branson community hosted two vigils on Friday night, one in the car park outside the duck tour business and another at a local church. The Rev Zachary Klein told mourners that he had no words of comfort to offer the families of victims “because there simply are no words to comfort them”.An initial investigation into the accident has blamed thunderstorms and winds that approached hurricane strength, but it is not clear why the amphibious vehicle had ventured on to the lake in the first place. The risk of severe weather was apparent hours before the boat left shore.The National Weather Service in Springfield, about 40 miles north of Branson, issued a severe thunderstorm watch for its immediate area on Thursday, saying winds of up to 70 mph were likely. It followed up at 6:32pm with a severe thunderstorm warning for three counties that included Branson and the lake. The boat went down about 40 minutes later, shortly after 7pm.“When we issue a warning, it means take action,” said meteorologist Kelsey Angle.Suzanne Smagala, a spokeswoman for Ripley Entertainment, said the company was assisting authorities with their inquiries. She said it was the company’s only accident in more than 40 years of operation.Pattison told CBS the boat “shouldn’t have been in the water” given the conditions on the lake.“To the best of our knowledge, and we don’t have a lot of information now, but it was a fast-moving storm that came out of basically nowhere is sort of the verbal analysis I’ve got,” he said. Two crew members and 29 passengers were aboard the pleasure cruise. Seven of the 14 survivors were hurt when the vessel sank. The captain survived, authorities said. Brayden Malaske, of Harrah, Oklahoma, boarded a replica 19th-century paddle-wheeler known as the Branson Belle on the same lake just before the storm hit.At the time the water seemed calm and no one was worried about the weather but “it suddenly got very dark,” he said.A video Malaske shot from the deck of the Belle shows the duck boat struggling through the choppy lake, with water only inches from its windows. Originally designed for the military to transport troops and supplies in the second world war, duck boats have been involved in other serious accidents in the past, involving the deaths of more than 40 people since 1999.“Duck boats are death traps,” said Andrew Duffy, a lawyer whose Philadelphia law firm handled litigation related to two fatal duck boat accidents there. “They’re not fit for water or land because they are half car and half boat.”Five college students were killed in Seattle in 2015 when a duck boat collided with a bus, and 13 people died in 1999 when another sank near Hot Springs, Arkansas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b33a55349450c8d085fc63947c4e6382dd9ae54/0_278_6177_3706/master/6177.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cdc3cda8053b952a67a3dec266637f7","title":"alexandria ocasio cortez bernie sanders kansas progressives democrats","story":"The rising New York star and the Vermont senator think leftwing politics can help Democrats win in the wheat fields For her national political debut, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez traded the concrete jungle of New York for the golden wheat fields of Kansas.The bright new face of the left joined the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, a leader of the progressive movement, at rallies in support of two congressional candidates who argue that a leftwing, anti-corporate political message can galvanize Democrats in Republican-held districts crucial to their push to take back the US House of Representatives.Less than a month ago, Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old democratic socialist who was working as a bartender less than a year ago, stunned the political establishment when she beat a 10-term incumbent, Joe Crowley, in a district that includes parts of the Bronx and Queens. With general election victory in November all but certain, she is using her star power to spotlight likeminded candidates around the country.“What you have shown me is that working people in Kansas share the same values – the same values – as working people anywhere else,” she said. “Wherever there is working class people, there is hope for the progressive movement.”In Wichita, Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders campaigned for James Thompson, a civil rights lawyer who in 2017 narrowly lost a special election in the fourth congressional district. In the neighboring third, they traveled to Kansas City, for Brent Welder, a labor lawyer and former Sanders delegate who is running in a six-way primary.Both congressional candidates are running on a Sanders-style platform that includes universal healthcare, tuition-free college and a higher minimum wage. This may be a tough sell in Kansas, which is home to the billionaire Koch brothers, who have spent tens of millions of dollars to promote free-market policies. Donald Trump won the state by more than 20 percentage points. Yet progressives see opportunities here, pointing to Philadelphia and Omaha, where leftwing candidates have won competitive primaries. And, they argue, in 2016 Sanders won the Democratic caucuses here by more than 30 points.“I’m not ‘Republican-lite’,” Thompson said, drawing wild applause. “If our state wanted Republican-lite then we would have elected somebody in the past 20 years as a Democrat here ... If a centrist message would have worked, then Hillary Clinton would have won here in 2016.”Kansas is not the only state that will test that theory. In the coming weeks, Ocasio-Cortez will take her populist pitch to Michigan and Missouri.“They will see that this thing wasn’t just lightning striking,” said Cori Bush, a nurse and activist whom Ocasio-Cortez will support at a rally in St Louis on Saturday. “By having her here, it will show people locally that this can happen here.”Inside the Democratic party, Ocasio-Cortez’s rise has been met with a mix of awe and skepticism. The Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, hailed her as the “future of the party” the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, dismissed the notion that her victory reflected a broader trend within the party.Ocasio-Cortez has stumbled. She wrongly claimed the cause of low unemployment in the US was “because everyone has two jobs”. She also sparked fierce criticism for referring to Israel’s “occupation of Palestine”, then admitted she was “not the expert on geopolitics on this issue”.Then the former senator Joe Lieberman, a Democrat-turned-independent from Connecticut, wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal urging Crowley to mount a third-party challenge. Crowley has said he will not.“Because the policies Ms Ocasio-Cortez advocates are so far from the mainstream, her election in November would make it harder for Congress to stop fighting and start fixing problems,” the 2000 vice-presidential pick wrote.And Republicans are watching closely, eager to use her leftwing politics against Democrats in Republican strongholds.“I can’t think of two people who best exemplify the brand of politics these House candidates are running on than Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez,” said Jesse Hunt, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. “Their far-left progressive policy proposals are better suited for liberal enclaves in New York City and Hollywood than Kansas.”Among Kansas’ progressive faithful, Ocasio-Cortez was lionized. Kamela Eaton, of Wichita, carried a homemade poster: a sketch of Ocasio-Cortez with the message: “Change is on the horizon”.“I’m so inspired by her - by her passion and her drive,” Eaton said. “She’s young she’s a woman of color. She’s just what the party needs.”In Kansas City, Welder told a sweat-soaked audience her victory was galvanizing leftwing candidates like himself.“She has become the kind of inspirational leader that people across the country have become desperate for,” he said. Welder is hoping to replicate Ocasio-Cortez’s victory in a district where Clinton narrowly beat Trump, making it one of the most contested races of the midterms. To win across the country, progressives argue that they must “expand the electorate” by bringing new voters into the political system – as did Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders.The energy at both rallies in Kansas were a reminder of how popular Sanders remains.“We must have gotten off at the wrong stop because people told me Kansas was a Republican state,” the senator said, sweeping on to the stage to thunderous applause. “It doesn’t look like it!”Many supporters wore shirts that said “Hindsight is 2020”. A woman waved a sign that said “Humanity needs Bernie”. A poster taped to a railing heralded a Sanders-Ocasio-Cortez ticket. At least for now, the pair are focused on 2018.“We won campaigning on Medicare for all, tuition-free public colleges and a green ‘new deal’ for generations to come,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “It is on that bold vision for the future of the United States that we can win back the soul of this nation. And it is going to be every single person in this room knocking on 10, 50, 100 doors apiece that is going to get it done.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b605955a2f7a22a1d2e15fb80ec9aa5490eed362/296_0_4723_2834/master/4723.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6105c3406da8b6a7bd335014385f4b05","title":"steve bannon plans foundation to fuel far right in europe","story":"Former White House chief adviser says he wants to rival to George Soros’s influenceSteve Bannon has announced plans to establish a foundation in Europe that he hopes will fuel the spread of rightwing populism across the continent.Donald Trump’s former chief advisor in the White House told the Daily Beast that he wanted to offer a rightwing alternative to George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, which has given away $32bn to largely liberal causes since it was established in 1984.“Soros is brilliant,” Bannon told the website. “He’s evil, but he’s brilliant.”The foundation, which Bannon said would be called The Movement, will offer polling, advice on messaging and data targeting and research to a network of rightwing parties across Europe that are enjoying a significant surge in support.Bannon has met rightwing politicians across the continent in the past 12 months, including Ukip’s former leader, Nigel Farage, members of Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National in France and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán. He told the Daily Beast that he envisioned a “supergroup” within the European parliament that could supply as many as a third of MEPs after next May’s Europe-wide elections. He also said he planned to spend half of his time in Europe once the US midterm elections are over in November. While Bannon has talked up his hopes of matching Soros’s impact, his initial ambitions to rival the financier’s reach and influence appear more modest.The Movement’s headquarters, which are expected to be in Brussels, is likely to have fewer than 10 full-time staff ahead of the 2019 elections, after which it will expand if its impact is judged to have been a success. Bannon gave no indication of how much money he intended to plough into the project, nor where funding would come from.Having been forced out of the White House, he has struggled to carve out a new role for himself. His campaign to replace dozens of Republican incumbents in the Senate with new blood has largely run into the ground.“People are starting to realise that the anti-establishment thing is kind of a luxury we can’t afford right now,” Bannon told the New York Times in May.He appears optimistic, however, about his potential impact on the European stage, buoyed by the knowledge that the leave campaign’s victory in the Brexit referendum was achieved on a £7m budget. He told the Daily Beast: “When they told me the spending cap was £7m, I go: ‘You mean £70m? What the fuck?!’ £7m doesn’t buy anything. It doesn’t buy you Facebook data, it doesn’t buy you ads, it doesn’t do anything. Dude! You just took the fifth-largest economy in the world out of the EU for £7m!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/259b92b8b4a147c689524485c6701c42d66dc1ff/0_27_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f78abe0c4d8249f8582c98e33ed2a820","title":"us immigration baby did not recognise parents after five month separation","story":"Fifteen-month-old came to symbolise draconian US policy of separating migrant families A 15-month old baby who came to symbolise the US government’s draconian policy of separating migrant families did not recognise his parents when they were reunited in Honduras on Friday, his mother has said.Adalicia Montecinos said her son Johan had “suffered everything that we have been suffering” after spending five months in an Arizona shelter having been separated at the Texas border from his father, who was deported. “I kept saying Johan, Johan, and he started to cry,” Montecinos said.Johan soon warmed to his parents, however, laughing as he received kisses outside a centre where they concluded his final legal paperwork before heading home.Montecinos said she could not be happier to have her son back, but expressed anger that he was kept from her for months, forced to watch him grow up via video.“I will never see my son walk for the first time, or celebrate his first birthday. That’s what I lost, those memories every mum cherishes and tells their children years later.”Johan’s case triggered international uproar when the Associated Press reported his appearance in a US courtroom earlier this year.“I never thought they could be so cruel,” said Johan’s father, Rolando Antonio Bueso Castillo, 37, who had sought entry to the US in search of a better life, determined that his children would not grow up in the same poverty that he had endured since dropping out of the fourth grade to sell burritos to help his single mother support him and his four siblings.Rolando’s younger brother had left the coffee-growing mountains of central Honduras for the US seven years ago and had thrived in Maryland with his wife and children. His sister had followed and had also done well, the Associated Press reported. Their eldest brother was killed in a drive-by shooting in San Pedro Sula, one of Latin America’s most dangerous cities.Rolando, who earned $10 a day as a bus driver, was well aware of the dangers of crossing Mexico. Scores of Central Americans have fallen to their deaths jumping on trains or have been murdered, kidnapped, robbed or raped on their way to the US.He nevertheless paid a smuggler $6,000 out of the money his brother had sent to him and packed five onesies, three jackets, a blue-and-white baby blanket, lotion, cream, 50 nappies, two bottles and cans of formula for the clandestine trip.The plan was for Montecinos, who was in her first trimester of pregnancy, to stay behind and sell baseball hats on her market stall with a view to her joining them a few months later.Father and son made it as far as Tampico, Mexico, 300 miles from the Texas border, when the plan started to unravel. The smuggler drove them to a warehouse and told them to board a truck filled with scores of other parents and children from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Peru.They spent three days locked in the truck, where buckets served as toilets. “We were carried like meat, but we had no choice by then,” Rolando said.In the Mexican border city of Reynosa, they boarded a makeshift raft and floated across the Rio Grande to the US. They trudged through the Texas brush until a US Border Patrol agent spotted them and asked them where they were going. Rolando said his response was simple: “We’re going to search for the American dream.”The pair were taken to a detention centre, where they were held in a cell cordoned off by a chainlink fence and where they slept on a mattress under a thin, reflective blanket. Rolando said he had to ask for three days before he was allowed to bathe Johan. “He was covered with dirt,” he said.He initially believed that at worst he and his son would be deported, but on the fifth day, immigration officers said they were taking him to an office for questioning and an agent removed Johan from his father’s arms. It would be the last time they would be together for five months.Rolando, who has apparently attempted to enter the US four times, spent 22 days locked up in different detention centres along the Texas border, knowing nothing of what had happened to his son and with no money to call his wife to tell her about the situation. Upon being deported he was told his son would follow in two weeks, but months passed. On Friday he would not say whether he would attempt another entry. “They broke something in me over there,” he said. “This was never my son’s fault. Why did he have to be punished?” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3567962.1531835019!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nature takes refuge as drought dries the landscape","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“Like our neighbours, we once depended wholly on the stream, piped to the house by gravity from one of its higher pools.”The hill stream ducks under an old stone bridge to swerve through a corner of our acre. Flash floods, carving through a layer of ochreous clay, have deepened its bed decade by decade, so that the tangle of fuchsia bushes arching from its banks now hide and muffle its day-to-day passage below.At the umpteenth day of drought I took binoculars across the road to look at the stream in the open ravine that ides the sheep’s rocky meadow. Down among mossy boulders, a slow gleam showed.Like our neighbours, we once depended wholly on the stream, piped to the house by gravity from one of its higher pools. Ours needed a tight little dam of rocks and sods to keep water above the pipe’s end. A flood of rain could sweep the dam away a drought could leave the pipe sucking air.Either way meant a long trudge up the hill. In summer sun that could be blissful: a big blue sea and chirping wheatears. Backside to the wind, in Paul Durcan’s treasured phrase, it was often more of a penance.Today we have the luxury of pumped water. With a well drilled down to 240ft (73m – at the deeper range of some 100,000 such wells in the nation), why should I bother if the stream is still running?It gathers itself in a small stretch of bog in the lap of the ridge. I have seen this, perhaps too breezily, as our upland reservoir. If months of drought dry it up, what then? An accomplished worrier, I choose to discount the endless, squelching abundance of the spring.I also try to picture what it’s like, down at the well pipe’s end. A big pond full of water, replenished by trickles from above? Or a crevice that will just keep flowing, so long as we don’t flush too often?The man with the rig, from Donegal and an excellent judge of these things, stopped the remorseless rumble and chatter of the drill when enough of the right-coloured water came gushing up. Then the health people had to test it, or we wouldn’t get a county grant. But no iron, sulphate, arsenic or E coli just sometimes, in a frosty winter, a bit cold to drink from the tap.According to the map of The Geology of South Mayo, our hillside wedge of bedrock is “grey-green lithic turbidic sandstones with blue-grey slates with black laminae”. They came from the seabed of the vanished ocean of Iapetus and were fractured and cracked in the big heave into mountains,.But there’s sandstone and there’s sandstone. The Environmental Protection Agency says: “In contrast with most other EU countries, the bedrock aquifers in Ireland have fissure permeability only.” Water flow, it insists, “is predominantly through fissures or fractures and not through pore spaces in the rock itself”. That’s clearly true of much limestone, but some dense, fine-grained Irish sandstone can also be as hard as steel.For much of the natural world, meanwhile, the trials of drought are recurrent and familiar. A holiday in Provence once showed me little snails clustered together at the top of tall, dry stems at the roadside. They were aestivating – hibernating, staying dormant – clear of the baking soil and up in the wind.In much of Ireland, our earthworms have been aestivating (Latin aestes  summer), wrapping their bodies into knots at the bottom of their holes and sealing their chamber with mucus to keep in some humidity. And snails, rather than climbing, work their way into the soil and exude more mucus as protection while they sleep.Our woodshed swallows are flying overtime to catch midges for their young: a depleted generation is missing, as their eggs dry out in the dwindling of bog pools, marsh and mud. Dragonflies eat midges, too, but exceptional droughts can threaten their own populations of aquatic larvae.Bats need midges for food, but also night-flying moths. In Britain, which shared with Ireland the three-month summer drought of 1976, the withering of specific wild food plants and loss of caterpillars brought a crash in some species of moths and butterflies.In rich ecosystems, such as streams, droughts can have complex effects. Studies of hill streams in Scotland and Wales have shown that even when a long drought has killed all the trout, many invertebrates survive in the moist gravel of the streambed. Timing can be critical in deciding what lives and dies, but a couple of years will bring back vagrant mayflies, stoneflies, caddis flies and the rest, along with questing trout, to lay their eggs and colonise."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Californian university town marks tragedy that occurred in early hours of June 16th, 2015Tour company director says the Dublin vehicles are not exposed \u0026lsquoto the same risks\u0026rsquoEmergency services respond after incident leaves part of the motorway impassableOrganisation says it wants to discuss \u0026lsquoissues\u0026rsquo on the tribute game for the soccer playerDr Diarmuid Martin also clarifies his comments on Josepha Madigan rowParty colleague says MP has apologised and acknowledged that what he had done was unacceptable\u0026lsquoHow should construction be financed?

And this is exactly what the white paper does. It means that we have for the Remainers, we have access to goods and services, a deal with Europe as well. We have financial markets as well.“And on the Leave campaign side of things, the bill, the EU bill stops. We leave the customs union, we leave the agricultural policy, we leave the common fisheries policy, and, of course, we are able to strike our own deals.”The comments came after Mr Barnier expressed concern that Mrs May’s proposal for a “facilitated customs arrangement” opened up the risk of major fraud, additional bureaucracy and damage to EU businesses. - PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: John ThysAFPGetty One of the most tumultuous fortnights in recent British political history ended on Friday with Theresa May doubling down on her opposition to the EU’s proposal for the Border backstop and Michel Barnier gently demolishing her Chequers proposal. But after a week at Westminster that saw politics descend into its most toxic, a close reading of what May and Barnier said on Friday may provide a soft glimmer of hope for the Brexit negotiations.As Conservative MPs exchanged angry barrages of invective across the Commons chamber during debates on Brexit-related Bills on Monday and Tuesday, veterans like Ken Clarke and Nicholas Soames said they had never seen the atmosphere within the party so poisonous. Remainers were incensed when the government accepted four amendments from Brexiteers around Jacob Rees-Mogg that appeared to undermine May’s Chequers proposal.In remarks that have been viewed more than a million times on social media, Anna Soubry said her fellow Conservatives who backed a hard Brexit admitted privately that their course would lead to the wholesale loss of manufacturing jobs.“What they have said in those private conversations is that the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs will be worth it to regain our country’s sovereignty. Tell that to the people who voted leave in my constituency. Nobody voted to be poorer, and nobody voted leave on the basis that somebody with a gold-plated pension and inherited wealth would take their jobs away from them,” she said.After the Brexiteers’ show of strength on Monday, Tory Remainers sought to flex their muscle on Tuesday when they tabled amendments to a trade Bill. The government whips were alarmed when an amendment to keep Britain in the European Medicines Agency was unexpectedly approved. But the rebels fell a handful of votes short in the vote on a more important amendment that could have kept Britain in a customs union.It emerged later that the whips were so nervous about the votes that they asked some Conservative MPs to break “pairing” arrangements with opposition MPs. Pairing is a longstanding parliamentary convention under which pairs of MPs on opposite sides agree not to vote if one is unable to come to Westminster, often because of illness, pregnancy, maternity leave or official ministerial engagements.When Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson, who has a three-week-old baby, discovered that Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis had broken their pair and voted in the two closest votes, she accused the government of cheating. Lewis and chief whip Julian Smith apologised, saying the breaking of the pair was the result of an honest mistake, an explanation repeated in the House by the prime minister on Wednesday.That story fell under suspicion, however, when it was reported that Smith had asked other Conservative MPs to break their pairs, although they had refused. On Friday, May was still resisting pressure to sack the chief whip but the episode reinforced the impression at Westminster of a government reduced to desperate measures to stay in control of Brexit.Boris Johnson used his resignation statement on Wednesday to attack the Chequers plan as Brexit in name only and to warn the prime minister that she must abandon it if she is to unite her party.In Belfast, May appeared to be shoring up her position with the DUP and Conservative Brexiteers who are unhappy with the central role the Border backstop has occupied in the Brexit negotiations. She said the EU’s backstop proposal would violate the Belfast Agreement’s principle of consent by creating a new border within the UK.“Under their proposal, Northern Ireland would be represented in trade negotiations and in the World Trade Organisation on tariffs by the European Commission, not its own national government.\u0026nbspThe economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal ‘third country’ customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept,” she said.The tone and context of May’s speech and its old-fashioned unionism, which sounded at times like the lord lieutenant’s welcoming speech at a Hillsborough tea party in 1955, left the impression of fighting talk. But the proposals she was attacking are not really part of the commission’s demands at all and Barnier sounded a conciliatory note as he offered to change the draft backstop proposal and to make regulatory checks as minimal as possible.As Westminster prepares to break up for the summer next week, the prime minister may have given herself room for manoeuvre on the backstop by erecting a straw man on customs and saying nothing about regulatory checks on either side of the Irish Sea.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

He then spoke at a nationalist rally in Zurich, where he also reportedly met Alice Weidel, one of the leaders of Alternative for Germany, a far-right party that now is the largest opposition faction in Germany\u0027s parliament.In France he spoke in Lille and attended the party congress of the far-right National Front, where he delivered a keynote address, throwing his support behind Marine Le Pen.In May he was back, speaking in Hungary after the re-election of Viktor Orban, the country’s right-wing leader.Mr Bannon’s new non-profit organisation will be a central source of polling, advice on messaging, data targeting, and think-tank research, he told the website.He said he wants his organisation to rival George Soros’s Open Society, which has given away $32 billion to largely liberal causes since it was established in 1984.Mr Bannon said he envisions a Right-wing “supergroup” within the European Parliament that could attract as many as a third of the MPs after next May’s Europe-wide elections. A united populist bloc of that size would have the ability to seriously disrupt parliamentary proceedings, potentially granting Mr Bannon huge power within the populist movement.Comment: Communism sent millions to their deaths - so why is it cool to wear it on your T shirt?Jockey recruitment crisis as generation of British stable hands are too tall, top trainer warnsFans become possessive over quote for Blake\u0026#39s graveGovernment\u0026#39s pro-EU publicity blitz gave Remain an unfair advantage in the referendum, report suggestsFire chiefs warn homeowners to cover mirrors to reduce fire risk amid heatwave Rise in bridal boutiques charging for wedding dress appointments as they fight competition from online and chainsTeacher at leading boys’ schools charged with trying to meet a 13-year-old girl for sexEd Balls lands his own BBC show following Strictly successMaine\u0026#39s lobstermen caught between climate change and trade wars\u0026#39Your favorite president did nothing wrong!\u0026#39 Donald Trump responds to Michael Cohen tapesZimbabwe\u0026#39s president Mnangagwa courts white voters ahead of electionSpain\u0026#39s conservatives swing to the right after leadership battlePolish \u0026#39trash mafia\u0026#39 paid millions to accept Britain\u0026#39s plastic waste - but how much ends up in flames?Pakistan rights group warns extremists trying to influence political campaigns in close electionMacron faces cover-up accusations after his aide \u0026#39donned police helmet and beat protesters\u0026#39 Ceasefire between Israel and Hamas holds after intense fightingLady Bamford\u0026#39s bid to expand her Daylesford lifestyle empire \u0026#39threatens to shatter the peace of the Cotswolds\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/15/textile-waste-1.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/15/textile-waste-1.jpg","title":"burberry burns stock designer clothing fashion industry environment","story":"Created with Sketch.Upmarket British label has destroyed £105m of unwanted stock in past five yearsClick to followThe Independent OnlineBurberry burns £28.6m of clothes and cosmetics \u0027to protect its brand\u0027Burberry\u0026nbspdestroyed £28.6m of clothing and cosmetics last year as part of efforts to\u0026nbspprotect its upmarket brand and guard against counterfeiting.The luxury British label incinerated the equivalent of\u0026nbsp81,000 of its signature plaid scarves, according to its latest annual accounts, in a practice said to be rife among fashion houses.Industry insiders\u0026nbspsay high-end brands burn\u0026nbspunwanted stock to prevent their clothes being sold at knockdown prices and worn by the\u0026nbsp“wrong people”.But the fashion houses\u0026nbspsay surplus goods are incinerated to prevent them falling into the hands of counterfeiters.Burberry destroyed more than £90m of products over the last five years, and the amount burnt annually has increased dramatically. In 2013, Burberry incinerated £5.5m of unwanted stock, less than a fifth of last year’s total.“The stuff that Burberry is burning is not waste – it is surplus, which is a very different concept. It is perfectly useable stuff,” said Orsola de Castro, cofounder of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit group that campaigns for greater transparency in the supply chain.The fashion designer told The Independent clothing brands destroying “vast quantities” of stock was a “massive, massive issue” that was “absolutely not unique to Burberry”.“In the case of the big brands, it’s absolutely very negative for them to suddenly have the same product with slashed prices,” she said.“Burberry, I can imagine, is particularly concerned about this because we all know that it went through a huge image change from sort of shabby to high gloss, high fashion. So they are probably worried about making things cheap and rolling back the clock.“It is brand protection, in this case. They don’t want it to go to the wrong people.”Burberry’s clothes are priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men’s polo shirts selling for as much as £250 and its famous trench coats priced at around £1,500.The company also sells perfumes and cosmetics, which accounted for £10.4m of the products destroyed last year.Fashion Revolution in picturesDestroying stock has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting.Burberry\u0026nbspsaid it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies who were able to harness the energy from the process.A spokesman said: “Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.\u0026nbspOn the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.”\u0026nbspBurberry\u0026nbsprecently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to help prevent waste in the industry, he added.Last year it emerged a Swedish power plant was burning unwanted H\u0026ampM clothes instead of coal.\u0026nbspThe plant in Vasteras, northwest of Stockholm, incinerated 15 tonnes of the retailer’s products in the first 11 months of the year.H\u0026ampM stressed it did not burn “any clothes that are safe to use” and said much of the destroyed stock was mouldy\u0026nbspor contaminated with lead.Ms De Castro called on the industry to be more open about the amount of clothing that was going to waste.She added: “We need to slow down. It doesn’t need to be drastic but it does need to happen, because whatever Burberry does with this stuff is not going to be environmentally friendly. There is no way of disposing of this amount of clothing in a way that is not environmentally invasive.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The nature of our future trading relationship with the European Union straddles so many Tory totems from the role of business to the European Court of Justice to the border with Ireland. As a consequence an internal party “deal”\u0026nbspthat took two years to put together fell apart within two days and now we are once more the laughing stock of Europe with only a matter of months before we leave.Reforging 40 years of economic, political and societal links in a constructive, inclusive and forward-looking way would be a challenge for any government but is clearly far beyond the capacity of this one. As a government in waiting, it is Labour’s job not only to hold the government to account but to set out what our approach would be. This is the work that Keir Starmer and Labour’s Brexit team has undertaken, exemplified by the amendments our party tabled to the Great Repeal Bill. But it is also my job as shadow minister for industrial strategy to consider what Brexit means for our economic future and to place decisions in that context. And that has to mean an economic future that\u0026nbspincludes everyone, and does not merely carry over the regional and social ides that helped deliver the referendum result in the first place.To achieve this we need to look back even as we look forward. And to look outwards to the world even as we consider how best to maintain a close relationship with the European Union.The industrial landscape of Britain today is the product of a succession of industrial strategies or non-strategies, each of which was ultimately unable to deal with the reality of the larger world economy. Britain entered the 20th century hoping to maintain its position as the supplier of manufactured goods to the largest empire the world had ever known, a strategy that could not be sustained given the scale of US industry and the understandable desire of the rest of the Empire to build its own industrial base. By the 1960s, British industry was increasingly focused on our domestic market, but even that more limited “strategy”\u0026nbspproved untenable in the face of more efficient and larger scale foreign competition from the United States, Japan, Germany, Korea\u0026nbspand ultimately China.In response, the Tories under Margaret Thatcher and her successors, and to a lesser extent the 1997 Labour government, pursued a kind of “anti-industrial strategy”. This substituted first North Sea oil and then City of London financial services for industrial competitiveness. North Sea oil was a finite national asset that delivered the expected temporary economic boost. The impact of our burgeoning financial sector was more complex. It brought substantial benefits in jobs, revenues and social capital, particularly to London. It also drove the “financialisation”\u0026nbspof our economy.Financialisation\u0026nbsp– the anti-industrial strategy The way in which financialisation proved to be an anti-industrial strategy is admirably set out in leading economist Mariana Mazzucato’s new book The Value of Everything. In it she describes the “two faces of financialisation”.The first of these is the way in which the financial sector has stopped resourcing the real economy – instead of investing in companies that produce “stuff”, finance is financing finance. Why lend money to a manufacturer that may fail when you can make a bet on some options hedged with other options that virtually guarantee a return in a few weeks? The owner of a medium-sized manufacturing business gave me a striking example of this recently. His high-street bank was initially supportive when he requested a loan for new manufacturing equipment, which would significantly boost productivity. Once the bank realised that the equipment would not be something they could sell on should he go bankrupt, their interest drained away entirely. It was willing to lend based on liquidation value, but was not willing to take a risk on a living business. In a financialised economy, capital tends to flow towards standardised securities rather than actual operating businesses that present bespoke risks.But it is not only financial capital that is erted from the real economy. Human capital is sucked in too. When I graduated from Imperial College in 1987, I would estimate that only about 10 per cent of my electrical engineering cohort went into industry. The majority went into management consultancy and finance, which paid better as well as having clearer career paths. Recently the dean of an engineering department told me that was still the case and asked how I could expect engineers to go into engineering when finance paid so much better and was quite honestly the only way a graduate engineer could ever hope to buy a home in London.I responded that they should come to Newcastle where not only could they buy a lovely home on an engineer’s salary, but also be within a few minutes of some of the most beautiful countryside in the world and at the heart of a concentration of culture that rivals far bigger cities. I recognise the dean’s point – with so much financial engineering demanding money and people, real engineering doesn’t stand a chance. But it is real engineering that drives industrial productivity.Financialisation is not just a problem because it drains resources away from industry. In a financialised economy, investors with short-term horizons tend to have more control over firms. This results in less reinvestment of profits and rising burdens of debt that, in a vicious cycle, makes industry even more driven by short-term considerations. In effect, this kind of finance is not neutral but changes the nature of what it finances.This was seen just recently with the GKN takeover by “turnaround company”\u0026nbspMelrose. An estimated 20 to 25 per cent of the shares in GKN were in the hands of hedge funds, many of which were expected to back the takeover – with the firm Elliott Advisors, owning 3.8 per cent\u0026nbspof the company, explicitly doing so. The bid was won by 52 per cent to 48 per cent. And Melrose itself is not run in any long-term interest other than maximising shareholder value: it has a long history of operating as a “turnaround firm” and almost a third of its own shares are held by hedge funds. The vote was essentially a referendum about the time horizons of British industry, and Britain lost.So when bankers and chancellors talk of having learned\u0026nbspthe lessons of the financial crisis they are wrong both at the macro and micro level. With UK national debt twice what it was in 2007 and household debt to disposable income at a record high, 10 years after the crash of\u0026nbspthe global economy, finance is once again at the heart of an existential threat to our way of life.Financialisation and inequality Even before the crash, this “anti-industrial strategy”\u0026nbspdrove social and geographic inequalities. Levels of income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient reached a pre-crash peak of 0.35 in the 1990s and, while improving slightly, remained high in comparison to the Sixties throughout the 2000s. Regional inequality was also a significant feature of the pre-crash economy, with data from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research showing a gradual rise throughout the 2000s in the difference in gross household income between regions. In 2005, average household income in the North East was 14 per cent below the UK average, while in London it was 20 per cent higher.Gini Coefficient 1961-2016 – 1 is the most unequal score, 0 is the most equal\u0026nbsp(Institute for Fiscal Studies)The Tories were either indifferent to these inequalities or at best felt they were an acceptable price to pay. Labour, under previous leaderships, believed that redistributive policies could make it all come out right in the end, and flagship programmes such as Sure Start and working tax credits certainly helped. But both approaches were fundamentally mistaken. Financialisation turned out to be a house built on sand – unable to generate enough wealth to compensate for the abandonment of the rest of the economy, and vulnerable to boom and bust cycles. Ultimately, the financial crisis of 2008 and the global economic crisis it spawned showed that the ideology of finance – that financial markets and institutions, left to themselves and the profit motive, would efficiently allocate capital – was a pernicious fantasy.British industry—creating real value in the real economyBut that was not the whole story. While\u0026nbspmetropolitan London came to comprise 40 per cent\u0026nbspof the British economy – and a 40 per cent\u0026nbspheavily dependent on finance and professional services – something else was happening in the rest of the country. Britain’s entry into the European Union, and the survival in parts of Britain of a culture favourable to engineering and manufacturing, fostered the growth of certain sectors of British industry as part of a larger integrated European industrial base. The supply chains of large European firms such as Airbus, Boeing and BMW are substantially British. Nissan’s Sunderland plant is the final destination for parts manufactured across Europe and produces more cars per worker than any other factory in the European Union. And GKN, itself one of the world’s oldest engineering firms, is a key supplier to international aerospace and automotive firms – including European giant Airbus, which warned against the Melrose takeover. Factories engaged in producing components and sub-assemblies and assembling components from elsewhere in Europe are now critical to the prosperity of much of Britain. Figure 1 shows just one of BMW’s many supply chains.Such integration requires frictionless borders but also agreed standards to define everything from the acceptable frequency of electromagnetic radiation to the atomic composition of a given chemical. Leaving the European Union will not mean less regulation simply more duplication. As they scramble to recreate existing EU agencies and regulations, businesses and government departments are realising that far from Brussels bureaucracy being imposed upon Britain, the European Union was effectively based on the “shared back office services”\u0026nbspmodel that Whitehall now champions for local government.In many ways, British agriculture has followed a similar trajectory to British car manufacturing, where British farmers have been able to successfully compete on both quality and price in markets defined by EU food safety rules. For example, British farmers export far more wheat flour to the EU – approximately 250,000 tonnes last year – than they do to non-EU countries – approximately 6,000 tonnes. The same goes for other agricultural products such as barley (one\u0026nbspmillion tonnes versus 50,000 tonnes) and oats (16,000 tonnes versus 4,000 tonnes).The EU is the largest importer and exporter of food in the world. As an EU member state, our farmers have benefited from preferential access to this market through exemptions from the tariffs and quotas imposed on non-member countries. And with 85 per cent of seasonal agricultural workers in the UK coming from Bulgaria and Romania, agriculture is one of the UK sectors most heavily dependent on freedom of movement.Food and drink is Britain’s largest manufacturing sector and Europe’s complex rules of origin guidelines could lead to a “hidden hard Brexit”\u0026nbsprequiring the restructuring of food manufacturing supply chains even if we secure preferential access.\u0026nbspAgriculture and manufacturing are both more important outside of London and particularly around the very market towns that have been most “left behind” by the new economy.As Britain contemplates how to engage with the world before, during and after Brexit, we need to understand the trade policy choices we make will drive the shape of our economy and are therefore also industrial policy choices, choices that will shape the very nature of what work we do, the health of our communities\u0026nbspand the way we live for decades to come.  The benefits of a customs union The Labour Party is united in supporting a customs union with Europe. We believe it will bolster our current industrial strengths and offer the possibility of continued industrial revival in certain sectors. We should not be complacent about this approach. Our place in the larger European manufacturing economy will still depend on our ability to innovate and to invest, so that British firms successfully manage and not just participate in supply chains. And this will depend on our learning the lessons of the financial crisis so that our financial markets and institutions actually invest in productive sectors.Unfortunately, the government continues to act as if the only issues in financial regulation are safety, soundness and fraud. While these are obviously important issues, they completely miss the question of whether our financial system is effectively channelling capital to productive and innovative investment. And this is the whole point of a financial system. A financial system that simply parks money in risk-free assets or honestly gambles on sporting events, would meet the characteristics the Tories have established but would still be a total failure. As Mazzucato argues, the traditional policies we have seen create a “healthy financial sector (bailed out, ring-fenced, and restructured) in a deeply sick economy”.Implications for industrial strategy of the alternativesLast week’s visit by President Trump to Britain revealed that he thinks the UK-US relationship is “the highest level of special”. Arch Brexiteers argue that he offers an alternative to a customs union with Europe: a free trade agreement with the United States, which, as a consequence of Nafta\u0026nbspwould really be a free trade agreement with all of North America. But while\u0026nbspthe US economy is of comparable size to the EU in GDP terms, $19 trillion (£14 trillion)\u0026nbspcompared to $17 trillion, they have different sectoral compositions and regulatory standards. Going in this direction would lead to substantial changes in the structure of the British economy.Earlier this year, trade experts at Harvard University published a report that included a candid assessment of obstacles to a US-UK free trade agreement. Its authors, including former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, reached the conclusion that it is “highly unlikely that a free trade deal between the US and the UK will be secured in the near term”\u0026nbspand, in addition, “the likely potential benefits for British businesses are less than often suggested”.The report focused on likely US demands for access to British food markets and likely British demands for access for British firms to US financial and professional services markets. These demands map the likely direction a US-UK free trade agreement would take both countries. Britain is attractive to the US as a market for agricultural products and for goods manufactured through US-controlled supply chains. Britain is also seen by some as a source of relatively low cost financial and professional services. Without an EU customs union, American business does not see Britain as a manufacturing platform – British wages are too high given the distance to the North American market. Labour costs per hour in manufacturing are on average £27 in the US and £23 in the UK – a £4 difference that does not compensate for transport costs.In a UK detached from the European market, the role of British industry in European supply chains will therefore not be replaced by similar roles in US-based supply chains. This is the critical point for UK manufacturing – we cannot replace European supply chain integration with North American supply chain integration.In addition, if British food safety rules are relaxed as part of a trade deal with the US, it is likely that cheap American agricultural products will significantly displace British agriculture. So we will eat chlorinated chicken from Arkansas, bake with GM flour from Dakota\u0026nbspand barbecue antibiotic drenched beef from Illinois. US farming is largely in the hands of mega industrial organisations. Agriculture is a much greater proportion of US GDP than it is of UK GDP. There are farms in Texas that are bigger than major UK counties – 500 square miles, for example. We cannot compete with agriculture on that scale without harming our landscape and bioersity, especially given that we already use substantially more of our land in percentage terms on agriculture than does the US. If our markets are opened up to US agricultural products, UK farming will either adapt to US food safety practices and scale or our agriculture will diminish greatly. If we were to follow the bidding of the arch-Brexiteers and take the US as our model partner it would be the end of our landscape and bioersity as we currently know it.In the place of agriculture and industry, there will be a US market for British financial services and other professional services such as\u0026nbsplaw, accountancy and management consulting. However, just as we have seen the integration of British manufacturing into European firms, we will likely see a wave of mergers and acquisitions in services as British firms are acquired by US firms seeking to serve the US market with British professionals. As a consequence, while\u0026nbspmanufacturing and agriculture would suffer, services and finance might not remain in British hands, especially given the current takeover regime that substantially limits the scope for government protection of UK businesses.A Britain without a customs union with the EU and with a free trade agreement with the US would have less industry, less agriculture, but more finance and more service sector jobs. It would likely be a Britain of growing regional and social disparities, and a Britain more vulnerable to financial instability. After all, it was the high concentration of financial services in the UK economy that meant we were hit particularly hard by the last financial crisis. If the UK economy consolidates further around finance, then we will become even more vulnerable.Turning from North America some look to the Commonwealth as an alternative future that harks to our past. We have strong ties to English-speaking Commonwealth countries around the world – economic ties as well as ties of language, immigration and history. In a digital world, we have the possibility of building networks of innovation that could contribute both to our own industrial competitiveness as well as the competitiveness of our partners.Countries as erse as Nigeria, Australia and India are all racing to be centres of technological innovation and to solve pressing problems in areas such as energy and education. In a sense, if we are open to our former colonies as partners, and generous with access to our own centres of innovation, we could perhaps create alternative pathways to competitiveness for our industry.But those same countries have requested access to the UK through preferential visa arrangements as part of any free trade agreement. India has requested an increase in the number of visas issued to skilled Indian workers and allow students to stay for longer after graduating, but so far government has refused calls to relax visa rules even within the current framework. Australia and other Commonwealth countries want their citizens to be granted the same rights as Europeans: to live and work in the UK after Brexit.Building a competitive commonwealth innovation network effectively requires the opposite of our current attitudes towards the Global South. Commonwealth leaders have criticised the government’s – reported – characterisation of post-Brexit trade as ‘Empire 2.0’. This was reflected in our treatment of the Windrush generation, which, in a sense, like our approach to Brexit, threatens to close critical doors to a better future for British industry and for Britain as a whole.Whether we look to North America or the Commonwealth, into our past or forward to the type of economy we want to become, the arguments bring us back to a customs union with the EU and an industrial strategy that will help rebalance the economy and provide the directed investment to get it growing again. The billions poured by the Bank of England into quantitative easing have signally failed to do this.A Labour government would invest £250bn over 10 years through our National Transformation Fund, and set up a National Investment Bank, as well as a network of regional development banks to channel investment into productive enterprises across the country, unlocking productivity and creating growth.Royal family release official photos from Prince Louis’s christeningPrince William and Prince Charles ‘refused to meet Trump’A history of tense meetings between US and Russian presidentsWe need to understand as we approach critical decision points around our trade policy and our financial regulatory policy\u0026nbspthat these are choices that will shape not just our relations with the outside world but Britain itself – that choices labelled trade policy or immigration policy or financial regulatory policy are in fact industrial policy, agricultural policy and economic policy.The Tory party ideologues are in no state to set out a vision for our future economy, far less to rationally assess the policies needed to make it a reality. Financialisation has proven to be an economic dead-end, creating wealth for the few at the expense of social equality, regional balance and long-term productivity growth.To build a more competitive and equal Britain post-Brexit we need a deal that strengthens our productive sectors such as manufacturing rather than one that deepens financialisation and risks our long-term prosperity. We also need a real industrial strategy based on our regional strengths that enables investment in the productive economy, delivering jobs in our towns as well as our cities that creates value regionally and nationally that can be shared by all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies.

He said his wife\u0026nbspSultana\u0026nbspBegen, a 37-year-old Bangladeshi national,\u0026nbsphad\u0026nbspbeen in the UK since 1988 and travelled in and out of the country multiple times with no issues.\u0026nbspWe were two families going on holiday together.

Vote Leave said the electoral commission’s\u0026nbspfindings were “wholly inaccurate”.Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who helped to coordinate the letter, said the watchdog\u0026nbspwas an “analogue regulator in a digital age” and warned that “dark money and dark data” could flood the system without reform.The suggested reforms include allowing the Electoral Commission to\u0026nbspimpose unlimited fines and to refer breaches to specialist police officers to investigate.MPs also called for campaigns to be forced\u0026nbspto declare their spending online, and outlined the need for tougher\u0026nbspregulation for digital political advertising – something the commission itself has backed.“Until these reforms are instituted, our democracy will remain susceptible to future abuses like these,” the letter said.Will the EU referendum be re-run after Vote Leave broke rules?Brexit referendum must be ‘rerun’ after Vote Leave fined for spendingIt’s a national embarrassment how bad Brits are at foreign languagesEU chief Brexit negotiator takes apart Theresa May’s new planMay insists chief whip not ‘trying to steal votes’ in ‘pairing’ row“Looking ahead, we cannot in good conscience have another election or referendum without ensuring our polls are free and fair.”Mr Kinnock said the democratic system was under attack from a mixture of foreign influence and abuses of the laws, describing the Vote Leave result as the “thin end of the wedge”.“The Electoral Commission is an analogue regulator in a digital age and is in desperate need of reform,” he said.“The commission’s fines are laughable and seen simply as the cost of doing business. I hope its recent call for reform will represent a fork in the road.“The government must act immediately otherwise abuse will continue and trust will decline – more dark money and dark data will flood the system and buy influence.”His concerns were echoed by Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas, who said it was “fanciful” to suggest fines of £20,000 were enough to dissuade people from breaking the rules.She added: “I am not asking for a rerun of the referendum, but I think it strengthens the case for a people’s vote on the final Brexit deal.”Kyle Taylor, director of the Fair Vote campaign group, which helped to organise the letter, said: “We cannot simply allow elections and referenda to be hijacked by illegal activity.“These elections decide the UK’s destiny and we the people deserve better.“Our politicians must now introduce measures to ensure this doesn’t\u0026nbsphappen again so we can be sure our elections are free and fair, and that the UK’s future actually reflects the true will of the people.”The Electoral Commission welcomed support from MPs\u0026nbspfor greater powers, as the organisation says it needs the tools\u0026nbspto regulate changes in political campaigning online.A spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“We have been calling for parliament to make changes for over a decade and most recently set these out in detail in our digital campaigning report.“With the increasing use of online and targeted digital communications, action must be taken by the UK’s governments and parliaments, and by social media companies, to improve transparency for voters.Brexit: 10 of the most ridiculous headlinesThis wholly false headline merited the first ruling by IPSO (the press regulator) under clause 1 of the revised Editor\u0027s Code of Practice.

A no-deal\u0026nbspscenario, which could come as early as March if talks collapse, is\u0026nbspexpected to cause massive queues of lorries at ports.A manual extensive check would be required to determine the complement of staff employed in customs roles.

There is a lot of work that’s been going on behind the scenes”.New Channel lorry parks will not be ready in time for no-deal BrexitEU chief Brexit negotiator takes apart Theresa May’s new planMay insists chief whip not ‘trying to steal votes’ in ‘pairing’ rowThe European Commission on Friday presented member states with guidelines on how to prepare properly for a no-deal Brexit at a meeting of ministers in Brussels. The advice, which warns of major disruption, comes after turmoil in Ms May’s cabinet and worries in Brussels about the stability of the British government and its capacity to negotiate.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, told The Independent: “Instead of properly preparing for Brexit, Theresa May’s government has taken their eye off the ball and wasted vital time arguing amongst themselves.“The consequences of not getting the preparations right on our borders is stark. The government needs to wake up.”Barnier: UK Brexit customs and single market plan may not be ‘legally feasible’ or in EU’s interestsOn Friday, EU\u0026nbspchief negotiator Michel Barnier\u0026nbsppoked huge holes in Ms May’s customs plan, warning that it might not be “legally feasible” and raising the prospect of no deal.A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “We have established that the Home Office does not hold the information which you have requested.

And he is the home secretary! This cannot be allowed to continue.”In his clarification, Mr Javid insisted his original comment referred to the Twitter user “buying into Corbyn’s position on antisemitism”.Labour’s turmoil over the issue will deepen next week, when MPs furious about the code table another motion at a meeting of the parliamentary party.A total of 68 rabbis from every religious stream in the country have urged the party to adopt the full, unamended definition of antisemitism from the IHRA.Corbyn called ‘f****** racist and antisemitite’ by Jewish Labour MPCorbyn supporters’ anger after Labour HQ ‘tricked him during election’Trump putting ‘millions of lives at risk’ says Jeremy CorbynCorbyn says May must call election if she can’t get Brexit deal passedCorbyn tells EU sister parties to reject austerity and neoliberalismIt is used by the UK and Scottish governments, the Welsh Assembly, by public bodies including the Crown Prosecution Service and the College of Policing and by scores of local authorities.Critics say that, in Labour’s code, it will no longer be antisemitic\u0026nbsp– but merely “wrong” – “to accuse Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations”.\u0026nbspIt is also weaker on\u0026nbspcomparing Israel to Nazi Germany and on statements that a\u0026nbspstate for the Jewish people is a “racist endeavour”, they say.But Labour insists antisemitic intent will not have to be proved\u0026nbspto find someone guilty of breaching party\u0026nbsprules for\u0026nbspmaking such offensive comments.It says its policy goes further in outlawing toleration of comments intended to offend Jewish people than the IHRA wording which is\u0026nbsp“too vague for application by a political party”.Mr Corbyn has been accused of failing to explain why Labour will not use the IHRA definition, following the national executive committee’s decision last week.The NEC did agree to throw it open to fresh consultation – but, meanwhile, disciplinary action has been launched against Margaret Hodge for an angry public confrontation in which the veteran MP branded Jeremy Corbyn an antisemite.The Barking MP, a secular Jew, said she was making him aware of her “anger and outrage” over the party’s adoption of its code of conduct.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Kosher meat requires all animals to be conscious at the point of slaughter.“We are checking whether the meat requirement can be linked to the place of residence,” he said, according to Austrian newspaper Wiener Zeitung.\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesArab lawmakers stand up in protest during a Knesset session in Jerusalem.

Only the ruling\u0026nbspUnited Russia fraction voted for, with all of the controlled “opposition” parties voting against.\u0026nbspSeveral deputies in the ruling party, hitherto known for demonstrative displays of loyalty, were mysteriously absent from the vote.\u0026nbspThe main provisions of the reform see the pension age increase from 60 for men and 55 for women, to 65 and 63 respectively. Its sponsors say the changes are necessary to bring the law into line with new life expectancy figures. Pension ages were last set in 1936, when pensioners accounted for no more than 2 per cent of the population. \u0026nbsp“Life has changed,”\u0026nbspthe employment\u0026nbspminister\u0026nbspMaxim\u0026nbspTopilin\u0026nbsptold parliamentarians. “We can’t remain in the 1930s.”\u0026nbspThe contentious issue of pension reform has been raised several times in the last two decades, but the government has repeatedly chosen to delay. It presented the bill in\u0026nbspless than auspicious economic times. Most Russians have faced real-terms wage falls since 2014, and the outlook is grim.\u0026nbspMr Putin’s trust ratings have\u0026nbspfallen to the lowest recorded ebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters.Critics have also railed against the way the pensions plan was communicated, announced with no discussion a few hours before kick off during the opening match of the World Cup, between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia. Fnance\u0026nbspminister Anton Siluanov has insisted that this was a coincidence, but the public outcry was real.\u0026nbsp“It is a bastardly way to introduce reform,” said the former Kremlin adviser Gleb Pavlovsky in an interview on the Echo of Moscow radio station. “The people have a deal with the Kremlin in return for not protesting – and the most important part of that deal is that they are given the chance to survive.”\u0026nbspIn some regions\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspproposed pension ages fall below average life expectancy\u0026nbsp– in Chukotka,\u0026nbspin the country’s far east, the male life expectancy is 60.33, nearly five years below the proposed pension age.\u0026nbspFor many families\u0026nbspthe change will represent a fundamental shift to their way of life. Even according to state pollsters, eight out of\u0026nbsp10 Russians do not agree with the plans. There have already been\u0026nbspprotests against the reform.\u0026nbspOn the eve of the bill, 14 people were arrested at an unsanctioned rally in St Petersburg.\u0026nbspRegardless of whether significant protests follow, the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever,\u0026nbspsays the political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann\u0026nbsp“It is a tectonic shift. Even before the pension reform, people were viewing the state as less and less of a father figure. But the reform strengthens that perception.”In Ms Schulmann\u0027s view, these changes will affect the transfer of power between Vladimir Putin and his anointed successor, a process which may begin as early as 2021.\u0026nbspThe paw of Mr Putin has remained strangely hidden throughout the process. His press secretary,\u0026nbspDmitry Peskov, has distanced the president from the unpopular bill.\u0026nbspReports, on the other\u0026nbsphand, suggested the president approved the plan before its first reading. And all the while, state media have been kept under strict control. They have been told to avoid the word “reform”, to avoid associations with the “chaotic” 1990s, but nonetheless to keep close to a line emphasising the necessity of reform.\u0026nbspThere may not be protests, but the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever\u0026nbspBut the attempt to differentiate a\u0026nbspgood tsar from bad\u0026nbspboyars might not have been altogether successful.On the back of the controversy, trust\u0026nbspin Mr Putin has fallen to\u0026nbspthe lowest recorded\u0026nbspebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters.

Until four years ago Fatima Abu Shedeg was not only unable to swim but had never been in a pool.\u0026nbspYet despite the challenges she has faced, she spends her days dreaming of stepping onto the starting block at\u0026nbspthe Tokyo 2020 Games as Gaza’s first Olympic swimmer.\u0026nbspIn 2014, Fatima lost her father during the last war with Israel, which raged for 51 days and left more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead. She saw her uncle’s legs blown off in the same airstrike that killed her father and destroyed most of their home in Beit Lahia, north Gaza.\u0026nbspLike many children in the tiny enclave, she suffered from post-traumatic stress.\u0026nbspThen Amjed Tantesh, 42, a swimming coach and one-time Olympic hopeful, encouraged her to learn to swim as a way of channelling her depression and anger.\u0026nbsp“A week after my dad passed away Amjed called my mum and offered me and my brother swimming lessons. My dad was killed by shrapnel from an airstrike which ricocheted off the wall and hit his heart. The same airstrike blew off my uncle’s leg. We were all downstairs screaming,” she said sitting by a small pool filled with murky green water in Gaza City.\u0026nbsp“It’s extremely important for me to achieve my dream, the dream of my family, of my coach, to be the first Gazan swimmer to take part in the Olympics,” she added.\u0026nbspFour years later, the fitness and football fanatic\u0026nbspspends her free time training in grubby and sometimes makeshift pools. Gaza is in the 11th year of an Israeli blockade, meaning Fatima cannot even get hold of proper swimming equipment. She is left to swim in a mismatched pair of pyjamas. If she qualifies it would be her first trip out of Gaza, which is just 25 miles long.She said swimming had helped her deal with trauma from the war and made her stronger.\u0026nbsp“I don’t want to be afraid any more. I want to be strong. I used to even be afraid of the pool, of water, and now I’m not. I’m determined to work on myself, to succeed,”\u0026nbspshe said.\u0026nbspIn June Save the Children\u0026nbspreported that a staggering 95 per cent of children in Gaza had depression, consistent with deep psychological distress. The charity said the constant threat of conflict, the fear of bombs, and the constant insecurity caused by the unstable political situation had created a psychological crisis in the country.\u0026nbspMany fear Gaza is now on the brink of another war with Israel as tensions have reached boiling point.\u0026nbspOn Friday the Israeli army said one of its soldiers had been killed by Palestinian gunmen near the border, the first Israeli military death near Gaza since the 2014 war. The army unleashed a tide of airstrikes that pummelled over 60 military targets in the enclave, in one of the most intense days of violence in four years.By the end of the day, the Gaza health ministry said that at least four Palestinians had been killed. As fires raged through the strip, a shaky truce brokered by Egypt was enforced. On Saturday, the United Nations urged both sides it was “imperative” to step back from the brink of a “devastating conflict”.At the heart of the latest eruption of hostilities is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests near the border fences that the Israeli army has met with force. More than 140 Palestinians been killed by Israeli fire since 30 March, when residents of Gaza first marched on the fences demanding right to return to ancestral lands they were forced from during the 1948 war which surrounded the creation of Israel.\u0026nbspSome of the protesters have taken to launching burning kites and balloons attached with explosives at Israel, sparking more than 750 wildfires and scorching 2,600 hectares of land.The Palestinians maintain the protests are peaceful and Israel is firing on them with live ammunition. Israel says their soldiers have been attacked and the wildfires are endangering Israeli citizens.\u0026nbspEarlier this week saw the most intense exchange of fire between Gaza and Israel since the 2014 conflict. Egypt reportedly intervened to stop war breaking out.Amid the escalating conflict, children, like Fatima, have suffered the most.\u0026nbspMr Tantesh said there were few resources or outlets for the youth to deal with trauma, though\u0026nbspswimming had\u0026nbspproven\u0026nbspa cheap alternative.\u0026nbspHe launched his swimming initiative in 1999 and said he has since taught more than\u0026nbsp5,400 children to swim. \u0026nbspBecause he initially\u0026nbsplacked access to pools and so, in the aftermath of the 2014 war, Tantesh built a makeshift sea pool\u0026nbspby using concrete blocks from bombed-out buildings to cordon off an area of the beach in north Gaza, where the water is less polluted.\u0026nbspIn 2015 alone, he taught some 465 children, with most of them receiving free swimming lessons.\u0026nbsp“All of them are war afflicted, they have lost a father, mother, relative or they have had a house destroyed,” he told The Independent.“But our new ambition is to prepare some of those children to qualify for the Olympics. Fatima is by far our best chance, she has developed the fastest and so we hope she will represent Gaza in Tokyo 2020. I have never seen such determination and persistence,” he added.Meet the girl who wants to be Gaza’s first Olympic SwimmerFatima Abu Shedeg, 13, dreams of leaping from the blocks at Tokyo 2020Fatima has survived three wars and until four years ago she was not only unable to swim but had never been in a poolIn 2014, Fatima lost her father during the last war with Israel, which raged for 51 days and left more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead.

Bar one person, a young judoka from Jerusalem who qualified in London’s 2012 Games, they have all competed on a wild card scheme.The Palestinian Olympic Committee chooses its teams from Gaza, the West Bank and Palestinian communities across the world. So Fatima will face stiff competition while she makes do with scant resources.Gaza lacks an Olympic-size swimming pool and the few pools it does have struggle to stay open amid chronic energy shortages. It is also increasingly dangerous to swim in the sea.\u0026nbspGaza’s environment authority said last year that nearly two-thirds of its 25 mile coastline was seriously polluted.\u0026nbspSewage treatment plants cannot function due to the power\u0026nbspshortages. The United Nations said that more than 100 million litres of waste water are pumped into the sea off Gaza every day.With filthy beaches and not enough electricity\u0026nbspto keep pools clean, trying to train a swimming team is near impossible, according to the Olympic Committee in Gaza.\u0026nbspIn a battered office and sat in front of a battery-powered fan, Munther Masalmeh, the committee’s secretary-general, said it would be a “major achievement” for a swimmer in Gaza to reach the Olympics.“There is not a single pool in Gaza that hits international standards. With our infrastructure problems it makes it even harder. It would be a major achievement to have a female swimmer here because of the lack of resources,” he told The Independent.The Israeli blockade also restricts access to sports equipment. Mr Masalmeh claimed even iron goal posts were banned because the Israelis feared\u0026nbspthey could be used to make weapons.“Sports equipment gets stuck in the ports for year and does not reach the athletes. In addition, the Israelis have in the past banned players from leaving Gaza to participate in international tournaments,” he added.Nonetheless, Fatima hopes one day to get permission to leave Gaza and take her place at the Games.“I want to achieve my dream to be picked for the Olympics, so I can travel and compete in the 100m race,” she said, putting on her swimming pyjamas.“I don’t just want to participate, I want to get first place,\u0026nbspso those who picked me are proud.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Blow after blow rains down on her authority. She is battered and bruised by her own party yet refuses to realise her time is up.The past few days have brought yet more resignations. Following the Foreign Secretary and the Brexit Secretary are ministers whose names escape me let’s call them Cuthbert, Dibble and Grubb.Though hardly well known, these MPs have grandly flounced off in protest at May’s handling of Brexit.In a particularly odd development, one is leaving the Government because he thinks the Government is not sticking to the spirit of government policy.All this on top of last week’s embarrassment, courtesy of Donald Trump. The President might have softened his comments about the Prime Minister and the “turmoil” afflicting the UK but the damage to May’s authority was done.God knows how this looks to the rest of the world. We used to bestride the international stage like a colossus now we stumble across it like Frank Spencer.The Prime Minister can’t take all the blame. She has been dealt a difficult hand — her party and the country split on Brexit, Europe turning the thumbscrews and Ukip waiting in the wings to hoover up Tory votes. It would be hard for any politician to make an outright success of this.But where Theresa May HAS failed categorically is on communicating her plans to the British people.The Chequers deal should have been a big moment. She should have been all over the TV stations selling this deal hard.In the past, prime ministers held public broadcasts to explain important matters to the people. Anthony Eden gave one on the Suez crisis, Harold Wilson on the devaluation of the Pound. Ted Heath warned in 1973 that the nation faced “the hardest Christmas that we have known since the war”.These leaders looked the nation in the eye, spoke directly to the British people — and LED.Theresa May, on the other hand, seems reluctant to get out and make the case for her own policy.Little wonder that two thirds of the public questioned on the Chequers deal were baffled by it. Confusion reigns.This points to a major problem with May’s premiership. She is hopeless at telling a national story.It’s the job of a leader not just to make decisions but to inspire the nation. For the person in No10, their words speak as loudly as their actions. They need to tell a compelling story about where Britain is going.Margaret Thatcher told the story of Britain emerging from the ashes of socialism thanks to the hard work and enterprise of its people: “A get-up-and-go instead of a sit-back-and-wait-for- it Britain.”Tony Blair told the story of Britain shrugging off the past and embracing the modern world: “A new Britain . . . a model 21st-century nation, based not on privilege, class or background, but on the equal worth of all.”David Cameron told the story of Britain clearing up the economic mess left by Labour, paying down our debts and living within our means.Love or loathe these leaders, at least they told a clear story about where Britain was going. We get none of this from May.She makes a virtue of just “getting on with the job”. But in a nation divided on Brexit, we desperately need more. We need a clear sense of direction for Britain’s future.Of course, the Prime Minister cannot last for much longer. In boxing terms she’s in the 12th round. Before long there will be a leadership contest — and those hoping to succeed May must learn from where she went wrong.The next resident of No10 must not only have the right policies but the right vision.If Britain is to regain its reputation abroad, and its self-respect at home, we urgently need a Prime Minister who inspires, who tells a national story — and who truly leads.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government must now learn the lessons from this catastrophic failure as it faces the challenges of migration onto Universal Credit.The DWP will pay out the money over the coming months."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004209345301.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may should go home","story":"They did so by a huge margin. Sadly, a year or so later they also voted to keep the appalling Anna Soubry as their local MP. Let’s hope they never make that mistake again.For the last year this bilious, jabbering woman has done everything she possibly can to thwart the will of her electors.She is a staunch Remainer and is seemingly prepared to bring down the Government to get her way. Her actions suggest she couldn’t give a monkey’s about what the people in her constituency think.Two nights ago she was one of 12 Conservative rebels who voted against the Government. She wanted Britain to remain part of a customs union with the EU. That would mean — effectively — no real Brexit. And if they had won, it would have been catastrophe for the Government. And in my opinion, the country.The reason they didn’t lose is solely down to a bunch of courageous Labour MPs, including the excellent Frank Field, who voted with the Government. Soubry isn’t alone, of course. The people of Loughborough, Leics, also voted by a large margin to leave the EU.But they are represented in the House of Commons by Nicky Morgan, who appears not to give a toss what they think. She also voted for a customs union. Nicky is famous among many for being the second worst Education Secretary this country has ever had. She’s pipped to the post for that particular prize by Justine Greening.Being useless in their Cabinet posts isn’t the only thing that unites these two women. Greening is also opposed to Brexit and she has even called for a second referendum. Because she didn’t like the result of the first one.The people of Beaconsfield, Bucks, voted to leave the EU. But their MP, the grim Dominic Grieve, who resembles a funeral director from about 1923, appears not to care less. He has said he’s prepared to “collapse” the Government if he does not get his way.Sarah Wollaston is another one. Another embittered MP. Her constituency, Totnes in Devon, voted to leave by a sizeable margin.Because while it is true that the majority of Labour MPs are also opposed to Brexit, they have been nothing like as dangerous as the Tory rebels.We are in a mess. The Prime Minister staggers from crisis to crisis, striking meaningless deals whenever she can to stave off defeat for a few more days.She surely cannot last much longer. A Remainer herself, of course, I think she should be persuaded to call it a day. Go home, put her feet up. And let her party elect a leader who will take no more c**p from Brussels.And no more c**p from the likes of Soubry and Greening, either.THE top scientist Richard Dawkins – Britain’s most famous atheist – has got himself into trouble.He has said that he prefers to hear the sound of cathedral bells to the muezzin wail calling Muslims to prayer.  Saying something as inoffensive as that is enough to get you into hot water these days.Dawkins has been called a bigot as a consequence. I have to say I disagree with him. I love the sound of cathedral bells, sure.But I also enjoying hearing the Muslim call to prayer – when I’ve been on my travels in Morocco or Malaysia. But, over here, it’s cathedral bells for me every time.Here’s a tip, then.Take them to an expensive shoe shop and make them look at the display through the window.And remember the noise they make.KATIE PRICE is on holiday in Thailand and of course she’s got her baps out.  This might be a problem for Katie, pictured with boyfriend Kris Boyson.Topless sunbathing is against the law over there. This is because tourists enjoy looking at the scenic islands. Without having their view obliterated by a pair of breasts the size of Koh Samui.So watch yourself, Katie. And as a break from lying on the beach, how do you fancy a spot of caving?YOU’VE got to love the toffs, haven’t you?  Most of them are absolutely crazy after years of inbreeding.Take the brilliant Lizzie Purbrick who described herself as “a very well-bred toff”.  She went round to her married lover’s home after he’d cheated on her with a third woman.No messing with Lizzie. She took with her eight litres of pig’s blood which she sprayed across his flat. She daubed the words “slut” and “whore” and “big d**k lord” on his walls and sprayed a giant penis on the floor.  She said: “So many people have said I should write my life story, but I’m so bonkers I can’t remember it.”The judge said – in one of the great under-statements of the decade – that she had “real concerns about the defendant’s ability to make rational decisions”.No s**t, Sherlock.It started out a few years back with just a couple of stalls. Now the entire town centre is closed off and thousands turn up to pig themselves on cuisine from scores of nationalities.I got so stuffed last year I needed to be helped home. And not a chicken parmo – the supposed Teesside dish of choice – in sight.IT’S not often that the Labour peer Dame Margaret Hodge says something worth repeating. But in telling her party leader Jeremy Corbyn that he was a “f***ing anti-Semite and a racist” I think she kinda hit the nail on the head.Meanwhile, the decent, moderate Labour MP John Woodcock has resigned the party whip and become an independent.Long-time party members – like I was, until last year – know that Labour is currently led by a hard-left anti-Jewish rabble of thickoes.I hope the voters twig this sooner or later.AND now it’s time for Hypocrites of the Week. A special award for Pimlico Plumbers of London.They’ve put up a giant banner outside their premises about Brexit, saying: “Nobody voted to be poorer!”Pimlico Plumbers has just lost a landmark case brought by one of its employees. He, like almost all of their staff, was kept on a contract which allowed the firm to pay him less than the proper rate.They were done under a UK Supreme Court decision, using laws designed to stop unscrupulous firms exploiting cheap labour.I wonder what it is about the EU that Pimlico Plumbers likes so much?

And the impossibility of its own airlines avoiding UK airspace. It won’t happen.Varadkar must believe that these grenades he brainlessly lobs into the Brexit negotiations help Brussels. He is not bright enough to realise how absurd and unstatesmanlike he looks.But he let something else very revealing slip too.Varadkar reportedly said that EU leaders have assured him no hard border or customs checks will ever be needed between Ireland and Northern Ireland.That’s under ANY scenario, including a No Deal.Since we will never build a hard border either, why is “avoiding” one still being discussed, let alone a huge sticking point?Answer: It is a ruse, confected by a Brussels desperate to keep us in its grip.Eurocrats yesterday tore apart Theresa May’s Chequers offer. Yes, the same offer already so over-generous it almost collapsed her Government.The Sun has never been more gloomy about the chance of a deal. There is nothing more Mrs May can compromise on.But Brussels is run by deluded bullies who apparently think they cannot lose.Martin Selmayr, the German who is effectively in charge, dislikes Britain and insists any deal must be punitive.The EU, while apparently negotiating with us, is also advising its members how to lure away our job-creating firms.Parliament, and its Remainers, must not be cowed. They must back Britain over Brussels. No Deal wasn’t our choice. But the EU is pushing us into it and telling its members to be prepared.Within eight months we must be fully ready too, economically and politically.THE huge surge in serious crime shames the supposed party of law and order.It is no coincidence murders, rapes, robberies and knife attacks are soaring with police numbers at a 36-year low.For years the Tories considered their necessary cuts to budgets safe enough. The evidence against is now irrefutable.But more cash is not the only answer.Many forces are appallingly led, obsessed with their image, with social media virtue-signalling and investigations driven by political correctness, all while ignoring the basics of keeping the public and their property safe.Home Secretary Sajid Javid must secure more money and reverse this horrific trend.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She would have let Charlotte run riot in her bedroom, trying on all her designer clothes and shoes and raiding her make-up bag.It’s so tragic that all of these happy times were not to be. When William saw all of his children come into the world, most especially baby Charlotte, he must have felt the loss of his mother even more keenly.Diana would have been there with her arms full of presents, and not just for the babies. There would have been thoughtful gifts for Kate and lots of hugs and happy tears.You can well picture her ­giving newlywed Harry a cheeky nudge and telling him to “get on with it” so she could have more grandchildren to spoil.I also think that if Diana had still been alive this sad situation between Meghan Markle and her dad would never have been allowed to turn so toxic.Diana would have seen this potential problem looming even before the engagement was announced and nipped it firmly in the bud.She would have insisted and ensured he was invited to the UK and would have dispensed shrewd and invaluable advice on how to deal with all of the hoopla surrounding the wedding. Diana learned the hard way how to deal with the media and palace officials. She was misquoted, manipulated and misunderstood during her time as a royal wife and knew all the pitfalls and how to avoid them.Skittish Meghan would have been soothed and calmed and all of the bad feeling among the Markle family would have surely evaporated.Diana would have advised Meghan’s dad on his wedding suit, helped him with his speech and rehearsed him walking down the aisle.She would have put this rather shy and ordinary man completely at ease.Rather than watching his daughter getting married on TV while cowering in a cheap bed and breakfast in the US, he would have been an integral part of the happiest day of her life.Instead, we have a constant stream of ill-advised interviews given by Thomas where he appears to have been ignored and abandoned and, whether it’s fair or not, Meghan seems increasingly cold-hearted.Photos yesterday of. him celebrating his 74th birthday alone with just a fast food takeaway for company don’t exactly help, whether they were staged again or not.A present, phone call or card from Meghan would have gone a long way to build bridges.It’s all turning a tawdry soap opera meaning commentators such as Sharon Osbourne will keep the pot boiling.Just this week she inferred Thomas has a drink problem and should get clean, ensuring more lurid headlines and bad feeling as he furiously has to deny all of the allegations.No one is coming out of this well and never has Princess Diana been more missed.Harry needs her wise counsel and William knows what an important part she could have played in the lives of his ­children.I know her sons will never really get over her death, but I do hope when William looks into his daughter’s beautiful eyes he is heartened to see a reflection of his mum rather than finding it ­unbearably sad.THE way BBC News treated Cliff Richard was utterly shameful and I’m not in the least surprised it lost its court case.The poor man went through years of hell and became a virtual recluse – and his physical and mental health was profoundly affected.At a time when he should have been enjoying the rewards of a lifetime’s graft, he was enduring sleepless nights and often crying in anguish on the kitchen floor.Many in the media have expressed fear and disquiet that any sort of Cliff’s Law will mean restrictions on newspapers, radio and TV, and this is indeed troubling.But the blame should be pointed firmly at those who thought it was a good idea to send a helicopter to film and report an OTT police raid on an innocent man.Seeing Cliff outside the courtroom this week looking extremely fragile and on the verge of tears was heartbreaking.Clearly the sunny, friendly, optimistic Peter Pan of Pop has gone for good and in his place is a haggard, careworn, wary victim.Before the court case, Cliff told me he doesn’t have photos taken with fans and their children any more.It was painful to see the hurt and mistrust in his eyes.He then revealed this week that his VIP status meant he was allowed to use the secret Wimbledon tunnel under Centre Court and Court No1 to bounce quickly between both venues and view as much tennis as possible.Cliff doesn’t do that any more, and never will, because the tunnel goes past the ball boys’ changing area and he doesn’t want to put himself in a situation where he could potentially be accused of something unspeakable.I really hope that when enough time has passed he can get some of that old “glass half full” spirit back, but he will never be the person he was.And no one else should have to go through such a hideous ordeal when they have done nothing wrong.IF you don’t want to watch a movie that will make you laugh, cry and come out singing Abba songs, we can’t be friends.I thoroughly enjoyed Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again – a rare example of a sequel that is better than the original.The starry cast includes Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, PIerce Brosnan, Andy Garcia and Colin Firth. But the cherry on the icing on the cheesecake is the legend that is Cher.I was lucky enough to host the world premiere this week in London and had the chance to talk to the cast, who were effusive in their praise of Her Cherness.It was surprising to hear she STILL gets nervous before going on set and she was genuinely bewildered by all the love in the air for her.I thought one elderly gay gentleman was going to explode with happiness when Cher blew him a kiss.It was so endearing – and there is nothing more deliciously camp than Cher stepping out of a helicopter in a blonde wig and sequins before going on to sing Super Trouper. She’s a class act and a throughly lovely woman.WATCHING politicians squabble like ferrets in a sack soon loses its novelty value – and our eyes are now glazing over whenever the dreaded subject of Brexit rears its ugly head.But we should never forget that when we woke up the day after the referendum – to discover a majority had voted to leave the EU – there was NO actual plan.Bupkis. Nada. Zilch. Diddly-squat.There wasn’t even a “to do” list.Instead, all the rats deserted the sinking ship, claiming the dog had eaten their homework or a big boy did it and ran away – leaving the (female) PM to tidy up their reeking mess. Funny that.No matter which way you voted, surely we can all agree on one thing.There was little or no thought put into how to actually implement such a seismic change. Not even a few notes on the back of a fag packet.Now, two years down the line, the whole big, fat mess is farcical and beyond parody.As a nation, we are a laughing stock.Shame on all those careerists and fence-sitters for their arrogance, stupidity and downright mendacity in not having even a half-arsed plan in place.A parcel of rogues, right enough.IF you fancy a right good laugh at some silly, bonkers, hilarious fun and games, tune in to BBC1 today at 5.05pm for another helping of Wedding Day Winners with myself and Rob Beckett.One couple will actually get married at the end of the show and it’s all very lighthearted and joyful.DID Burberry REALLY need to make a bonfire of its overpriced designer swag and burn an eye-watering £28million worth of clothing and cosmetics?In line with other designer labels, the fashion house claims the move was to stop counterfeiters getting their hands on garments and using them to produce fakes.But surely that just doesn’t add up.If criminals want to reproduce any designer clothes or handbags, they can go into any shop and purchase something – or, even simpler, just order it online.Could Burberry not instead have the mother of all sales in aid of Help for Heroes, or for the homeless charity Centrepoint, or any number of deserving causes here and in the Third World?That £28million would have gone a hell of a long way to help those in need.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am a teacher and value education, but this reward system helps no one.“One hundred per cent attendance is down to good luck or irresponsible parenting, neither of which seems right to reward. It shocks me it’s still allowed.“Children as young as four are being discriminated against.”Head Linda Wilmann said: “We’ve always had an annual award for those pupils who achieve 100 per cent attendance for the whole year. It’s a massive achievement and should be recognised.“Attendance and punctuality are crucial to ensure children get the most from their time at school.”Earlier this month two schools left devastated students sobbing when they refused to give them ice creams because of their bad attendance.GOT a story?

taken in 2003 at Brogdale, near Faversham, Kent.Public Health England issued a warning for Brits to make sure they protect themselves from harmful UV rays as temperatures creep ever higher.Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said: “After 31C on Sunday, Monday sees a step up in temperatures to 32C, with Tuesday and Wednesday seeing a chance of 33C – and I wouldnt bet against 34C locally.“The second half of the week is likely to stay hot, with a more pronounced southerly feed meaning potential for a degree or two more, with 35C shown on forecast models.“The following week looks like things further hot weather in the South and East.”But even before we get there things are looking bright and sunny, with the fine weather returning after a series of thunderstorms and downpours yesterday.The Met Office said today could get to near-30C, and would be followed by 31C tomorrow, 32C on Monday and 33C or 34C on Tuesday and Wednesday.Thunderstorm warnings were in place across most of south-east England until the end of yesterday, with much of the UK seeing some rain.Forecasters probably wont need to extend them into Saturday although heavy rain was persisting in the South West and Wales.There were concerns earlier over potential travel disruption as holidaymakers began to set off following the start of the school break.Clouds this morning should later make way for afternoon sunshine, with temperatures expected to reach 29C (84F) in London.Mr Keates said: There will still be dribs and drabs of drizzly rain in places but the amount of rain at this stage should probably not be much.Most places will see some sunshine by the afternoon but there still will be quite a lot of cloud in some places - it wont be wall-to-wall sunshine.Sunday will be the better of the two days, with England seeing fine, dry weather, sunny spells, with the mercury rising above 30C (86F).The South East and parts of Wales will experience temperatures in the mid-20s, rising on Sunday, while north-west Scotland will see cloudier and wetter conditions.As of Wednesday, the UK had just 1.85in (47mm) of rain, making it the driest start to summer in modern records which date back to 1961, followed by 2013 with 2.3in (59mm) of rain."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000421984865.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"supersize model piling on four stone to fulfil ambition to have the worlds biggest bum","story":"Curvy Swede Natasha Crown is now gorging on pizza, pasta and six kilos of Nutella a month to achieve the body of her dreams.Doctors have told her she needs to gain an incredible 56lbs (four stone) so they can they redistribute the fat and make her current 70-inch butt even bigger.She said: The more I gain the better the bum will be.  Ill do whatever it takes to have the world’s biggest bum.”Natasha, who is 5ft 10 and weighs 21st, from Gothenburg, earns a living from selling her videos and photographs to big bum fanatics.She was just 20 when she had her first cosmetic procedure and admits she is now addicted to going under the knife.The blonde said: “Maybe I have body dysmorphia or something but I don’t feel like it is even that big.

Politics is a man’s world and, to many, women still feel like token visitors.Even when Tony Blair famously had 101 “babes” in his 1997 intake of MPs, only four of his Cabinet appointments were female.Here we are, 20 years later, and yes, we have a female Prime Minister but there is still a prevailing view that the Cabinet, in particular, belongs to men.Clearly there’s something profoundly wrong with that equation.Given that this country is made up, more or less equally, of men and women, things would undoubtedly be fairer, not to mention calmer, if more women were on board.So the big question is, why aren’t there?Things are better than they were. Since the 2017 election there are 208 women in the Commons, up from 191 in 2015.But there are still not enough and you don’t have to look far for reasons why that might be.Most women are put off by the environment and the culture and wonder why on earth they would want to put themselves within a country mile of either.Take Prime Minister’s Question Time, which appears to be a bunch of overgrown public school boys booing, jeering and jostling with each other in their bid to establish who is top dog.What woman in her right mind would choose to enter that fray?Then there are the practicalities. This week, Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson was “cheated” in a crunch Brexit vote by the breaking of her pairing pact.This is an arrangement where one MP agrees not to vote to cancel out the fact that another MP on the opposite side is unable to vote — in this case Swinson was at home with her three-week-old baby.The problem was, her pairing partner reneged on the deal and voted.Then there are the hours, which can be difficult if you have a family. Any woman would need a very understanding partner and family to do the job.Also, any MP is opening themselves up to the line of fire and a lot of personal criticism — which multiplies for female MPs.Some have to deal with endless comments and speculation about their appearance, as well as threats of rape and death on a regular basis. Just this week a man was arrested over abusive Facebook posts aimed at various female MPs.If it’s true voters are biased against women, any female has to be ten times as talented, determined and tenacious to get the job in the first place.It’s no wonder women are put off entering politics.But if we want true equality then more women need to go into Westminster and the culture needs to change.That is why I support the campaign group Women To Win and will be taking part in an event called The Voice Of Women In Politics.The idea is to try to encourage more women into Parliament, outlining some of the changes that need to take place to raise the number of female candidates.Getting more women into politics is a no brainer.Women tend to work collaboratively to solve problems whereas — in my experience — men are more likely to lock horns, point fingers and try to shout the loudest. All too often men are interested in progressing to be a leader, whereas women are more focused on getting the job done.And when women DO find their voice in politics, it can be very powerful, and they often hae the balls to say things that men just wouldn’t.Look at Tory minister Anna Soubry, who this week suggested the PM should take control of her hardliner MPs and stop pandering to the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg.I know she’s got a lot on her plate at the moment, but if I was Theresa May I would be spending a good proportion of my time and energy on making real changes to politics in order, specifically, to attract many more women.It could be one of the greatest legacies she could hope for.Thomas Markle is a concerned dad who just wants to be reconnected with his daughter.Meanwhile this HALF-sister has turned a constant shade of green and wants to get involved in any way she can.Is it any wonder she wasn’t invited to the wedding?MY heroine of the week is 21-year-old Emilia Holden a waitress in Georgia, US, who was at the end of a shift when a customer casually grabbed her bottom as he walked past.Her response? She followed him, grabbed him and body slammed him to the ground, then called the police – after which he spent two nights in a police cell.What a fantastic response. Good for her.But also, who are these men that think that they can just grab a woman’s behind just because they want to?But hearing about elaborate plans by Pixie Lott which include a total of 18 bridesmaids all wearing the same dress, left me feeling a bit stressed out.Apart from anything else, it will take them all an hour to travel up the aisle.JAMES GODDARD-WATTS, the businessman whose family founded the hardware firm Screwfix, is still locked in a multi-million pound divorce battle with his ex-wife, Julia.They reached an agreement eight years ago ­– following the end of a 13-year marriage – that Mrs Goddard-Watts should get a £3.25million house and a £4million lump sum.But she complained that Mr Goddard-Watts had not revealed the full extent of his wealth at the time of the settlement and court fights began.Critics say Julia is a leech, greedy and after his money.But when you consider the worth and value of building a home, looking after children and a family while supporting a spouse, that should be worth at least half of whatever the partner who didn’t do all of that has earned in the meantime.So why shouldn’t she take him back to court?The law states that assets are divided equally.So people who hide theirs from their spouse only have themselves to blame if said spouse feels forced to take them to court to get what’s fair.ELLE Macpherson’s diet regime is enough to make me reach for the pizza delivery menu.The model is up at 5am. She has warm water, lemon and cayenne pepper.She has no booze, almost no carbs, no meat and no dairy. She is such a follower of the alkaline diet – based on the theory you can change the pH of your body through food – that she checks the acidity of her urine.I’m sure the diet is good for her – but who wants to add years to your life if those years are going to be so, well, dull?“The only chance I have of being on TV again is if I were very ugly,” he said.“I think only old, ugly women can get on TV.

Or a crap remake of Fight Club — except they DO talk about Fight Club.

You may not agree with it, but you know what they stand for.“Live each day like it’s your last,” is our Prime Minister’s political strategy, except she’s not dancing in the rain.She is waiting for the sharks to circle. And soon they will come for her.Buffoon-in-chief Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg — a man so old-fashioned he could have been dug up by Time Team — wait to pounce. And Brexit is a mess. Things are so bad, even Elon Musk is out of ideas. No one will be happy with where we end up.And because there is no party political or Brexit majority in the Commons, politics is stuck, trapped in what feels like a never-ending Brexistential crisis.Normally, I’m with “Brenda From Bristol” when it comes to more elections and referendums.But maybe a People’s Vote on the final deal or another election is the only way to unblock Brexit.Think of it like a political plunger — unpleasant, nasty but necessary.You’d think the Opposition would be gleefully capitalising on all this chaos. Think again. Instead of going after the Tories, Labour has decided to traumatise the Jewish community. Again.Labour has had a horrible problem with anti-Semitism, yet instead of healing the wound, it has poured vinegar on it by choosing not to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance code of conduct.These guys sound pretty authoritative and the code is good enough for government departments and the Crown Prosecution Service.Many Jewish groups and leaders, including the Chief Rabbi, are distraught, confused and angry. And you can see why.This shameful decision led to an angry clash outside the Commons chamber where Jewish MP Margaret Hodge confronted Jeremy Corbyn, allegedly calling him an anti-Semite and a racist.Hodge lost family in the Holocaust and fought off the BNP in her Barking and Dagenham constituency.Instead of acknowledging her pain and offering to sit down with her, Team Corbyn are taking disciplinary action against her.I bet they deal with her far quicker than they did with Ken Livingstone, who couldn’t stop banging on about Hitler.What dark times for Labour, which once had a proud tradition of fighting racism. They must sort it out.Then we have the Lib Dems, who have proved useless. They have one policy — stop Brexit.Yet leader Vince Cable and ex-leader Tim Farron missed crucial votes on Monday. Talk about Dem and Dumber.To top it all off, the DUP’s Ian Paisley Jnr has been suspended for 30 days — which hasn’t happened since 1949 — for failing to declare lavish holidays to that well-known Northern Irish stakeholder, Sri Lanka.And to think Theresa May planned to give MPs an extra five days off as a reward for all their hard work.The country has had enough of these fools’ infighting, incompetence and filling their boots. Especially when we face so many big problems, from NHS funding to housing.Parliament’s end-of-term report is a big, fat fail. British politics should be taken into special measures.THE premiere of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was sun-kissed, frothy fun –  and no one mentioned the ­Customs Union. Bliss.The stars were out in full, including Cher. She is magnificent, but it is a little odd that at 72 she has fewer wrinkles than any other cast member, including 29-year-old Lily James. And the baby.She told Lorraine Kelly it was down to not drinking, smoking or doing drugs. Yeah, right.We women may be naive when it comes to the quest for eternal beauty, but we ain’t stupid.WHEN you hear of people getting up in the middle of the night and queuing, you think of the Boxing Day sales or the release of the latest Apple gadget.You don’t think of childcare.Yet more than 100 parents queued from 3am – armed with chairs, flasks and biscuits – trying to bag their child a coveted place in the breakfast club at a primary school in Cardiff.For many working parents, breakfast clubs are a lifeline.They can drop off the children in a safe environment where they can get a decent breakfast, then make it to work on time themselves.Though parents have the right to request flexible working hours, many fear the sack if they come in late.These spaces were limited and dished out on a first-come, first-served basis, which is why the parents took such drastic measures.This shows how desperate parents are for childcare that matches their working hours.The scrapping of Labour’s extended school programme and the first real-terms cuts to schools mean all these extras that were provided are no longer affordable.Childcare isn’t a luxury.It’s a necessity for millions of families and they are crying out for more breakfast and after-school clubs.JEFF BEZOS, the boss of Amazon, is a man clearly in his “Prime”.He’s now the richest man in modern history.Good for him.I’m all for celebrating entrepreneurs and hard work – but shouldn’t that apply to his poor workers toiling away in his warehouses?They would probably give Amazon working conditions zero stars.I wish our business leaders remembered some of their forefathers, who felt a moral and civic responsibility to look after their employees and took some pride in that.It makes business sense too. Happy workers are better workers.So after Bezos pops open the champagne, maybe he could spare a thought for his staff, who told an undercover reporter they pee in bottles because the loos are too far away and they are afraid of being accused of time-wasting.C’mon, Jeff – that’s really taking the p**s. ONE school in Liverpool had to apologise after kids as young as four were left in tears when they were denied an ice cream treat because they didn’t have a 97 per cent attendance record.How mean is that? What if they were ill? And surely it’s the parents’ fault.CARERS got another kick in the teeth this week when the Court of Appeal overturned a decision that those doing sleep-in shifts should earn at least the minimum wage.If the decision had gone through, it would have cost the UK care sector billions – so charities and local governments were relieved.But it shows what a raw deal carers get.Judges said only hours spent awake counted as work – but that is completely out of touch with the reality of what carers do.Many of the elderly and vulnerable people they look after need their help through the night, whether it’s a trip to the loo, to take medication or dealing with more serious situations such as seizures. Carers can’t exactly fall into a deep sleep. They have to be alert and listening in case they are needed.The rooms they sleep in may not be comfortable and they will be away from their own families.Many carers are paid so little that they live hand to mouth and barely get by.When I met a group in the West Midlands, they told me they couldn’t afford to put the heating on in winter and had to take their kids to the grandparents’ for tea once or twice a week just so they would be fed.Some were struggling so much they had to visit food banks.But they also loved their jobs and took great pride in looking after their clients as if they were family.They get paid a pittance, with some earning just £30 for a ten-hour shift.These low-paid workers – the majority of whom are women – are unsung heroes and deserve more.New Health Secretary Matt Hancock must make social care a priority and enforce minimum-wage law properly.It’s time we took better care of our carers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Charlie Heald, 13, took action following the introduction of the \u0027Attitude to Learning (A2L) Record\u0027 at Trentham Academy in Staffordshire. But it is not just Charlie who is not happy about the new system. He collected signatures from around 80 students on the first day. He told StokeonTrentLive: It\u0027s so strict now that you can\u0027t do anything at all. Pretty much everyone thinks it\u0027s stupid. I thought, \u0027Well that\u0027s how things get changed in Parliament, so why not a school?\u0027 So I went into school with a notepad and pen acquiring as many signatures as I could.  He says the system is excessively strict and \u0027hated\u0027 by pupils at the Allerton Road school. The year nine pupil said: I am campaigning to get rid of this system because I don\u0027t enjoy it and neither do the other students. Rather than keep refusing to use the new system I decided to do a petition to make my opinion known. I seem to be getting in more trouble since this started. It is marked down if you do the slightest thing, like your shirt is untucked or you put your head on the desk.  A2L has been trialled at the school in recent weeks and will be implemented properly in September. Students have been required to carry a sheet of paper with them to every lesson, on which their behaviour is given a score. If their behaviour does not reach the expected standard they are given verbal and written warnings before being punished if it does not improve. Parents are asked to sign the record on a weekly basis so they are aware of their child\u0027s conduct. Charlie, who lives in Trentham, was overwhelmed by the support for his campaign - with around 80 pupils signing his petition on the first day. He said: I was really surprised by how many people wanted to sign it. People I don\u0027t even know were coming up to me. When I\u0027ve got enough signatures I will bring it to the headmaster. I\u0027m usually pretty good and I get on with the teachers but I felt like I wanted to stand up on this.  Dad Tim Heald is backing his son\u0027s campaign. He said: There are a lot of parents that don\u0027t agree with A2L. The pupils have to carry this piece of paper around with them all the time and if they haven\u0027t got it they are penalised. They are teenagers - of course they are going to lose them. At the end of each week the parents have to sign it. It\u0027s unnecessary. Their behaviour is recorded in the register anyway and we know if he\u0027s being good or bad. It just seems daft. We talked to Charlie and said perhaps there was a better way to do things than just arguing with the teachers, so he decided to do the petition. He wrote it out himself and has gone in early to talk to people about it. Trentham Academy is part of the City Learning Trust, which says the A2L system works well in its other schools.

A blinded eye. Deep scars across the distorted left side of her face. An ear damaged almost beyond recognition by shotgun pellets fired at point blank range in a moment of madness that made Jodie Woodward Britain’s youngest ever gun crime victim at only two years old. But what is also there, etched into that ravaged face, is a deep, defiant inner strength. Remarkable bravery that once moved the People’s Princess – and the nation too at the Children of Courage Awards.  Now, more than three decades on, Jodie speaks for the first time about the terrifying day that changed her life for ever after it had barely even begun. And she reveals how she turned down cosmetic surgery to completely repair her face – because she already has everything in life that she needs. “I started a family and that was my priority – not my face,” says Jodie, with a heartwarming smile on the eve of The Diana Award ceremony in London, a charity recognising brave and inspirational youngsters around the country which was launched in the Princess’s name. “I lost one eye, my ear had to be rebuilt, and movement on my right side is limited. “But I wake up every morning and say to my daughter ‘today is a new day – let’s make it a good one’.  Yet one horrifying night in September, 1984, left Jodie with half her face blown off just two days after her second birthday – and her mother Cheryl, then 29, seriously injured too – as neighbour and family friend Rod Davie, 35, smashed his way into their home with a shotgun. The tot’s devastated dad Bill was later told his daughter’s injuries were so catastrophic she might not survive – and if she did she could be a “cabbage” for life. Jodie, 35, who now has a 14-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son of her own, calmly pieces together those dreadful moments of mayhem. “Rod was our neighbour and he’d had an argument with his wife,” she says. “She grabbed her daughter, left their house and knocked on our door looking for help. He grabbed a gun and smashed our door in. “My mum came downstairs and he just opened fire.”  Davie shot twice at Cheryl, blowing the handrail off the staircase and forcing her to run back upstairs. She hid behind a bedroom door as Davie went into the sitting room where her little daughter had been watching TV. She recalls: “I was sitting crying on the sofa in the sitting room. He came up and shot me at point blank range in the face. “When Mum heard me stop crying she assumed I was dead. Then he ran upstairs to look for Mum. She begged for her life as he pointed the gun in her face too.” Cheryl begged for mercy, but as Davie pulled the trigger she turned her head in a split-second decision that saved her life but left her with dreadful injuries.  Because the gun was so close, the pellets did not have time to spray and cause more deadly wounds. The attacker then calmly walked back home and shot himself dead. Cheryl, still conscious but badly injured, dragged herself out into the hallway on her hands and knees, desperate to be with her daughter in what she thought would be her final moments. Another neighbour had heard the gunshots and called the emergency services to the address in Walderslade, Kent. Mum and daughter were rushed to hospital where surgeons battled to save little Jodie’s life during a 12-hour operation. Her left eye was removed along with half of her face and most of her ear. Davie’s shot had hit Jodie in the temple. Doctors prepared her engineer father Bill, who had been at work at the time, for the worst. “When I first arrived at the hospital I went to see Cheryl,” says Bill, 63. “She was bad but she told me to go and sit with Jodie who was in a coma because she may not be with us much longer.  “I asked doctors about Jodie’s chance of survival and they couldn’t say whether she was strong enough to make it. “I wept like a baby when I saw her, but I was just so grateful she was still alive. “She was covered in bandages so you could not see much. But I saw the police photos of the crime scene and it wasn’t pretty.” Just two weeks later, Jodie amazed everyone when suddenly awoke and began to fight back. Cheryl also recovered but remains traumatised. Over the years that followed, Jodie, who still lives in Kent, recovered 90 to 95 per cent brain function after injuries initially left her paralysed down one side.  Shotgun pellets are still visible behind her ear and her X-rays look like a blizzard, with thousands of little white dots all over her head, neck and face. “When I was pregnant 14 years ago I was offered surgery which could completely repair my face,” she says. “But I didn’t want any more surgery if I don’t really need it. I’ve been poked and prodded so many times over my life I’ve had enough. If I’m not in pain and the only reason for more surgery is cosmetic. I just don’t see the point.”  On her wall is a proud picture of her meeting Princess Diana at the 1985 Children of Courage awards at Westminster Abbey. Jodie says: “I don’t remember meeting her but apparently she tried to take my hand and I shied away. “I have a little autograph book of the day. There were lots of famous people like Lenny Henry and Nicholas Lyndhurst, but the only thing I actually remember is meeting Rod Hull’s Emu the puppet from TV.” "},{"url":null,"title":"fugitive gangster sends friends photos","story":"NewsFugitive gangster, 34, sends friends photos of diamonds after skipping bail for \u0027charity mission\u0027Sam Walker - who claims to have more than 100 convictions - flew to Sierra Leone despite being due to appear in court in Chester\u0026nbspShareByNicola Small20:46, 21 JUL 2018Updated21:03, 21 JUL 2018NewsThe self-styled hardman claims to have more than 100 convictions (Image: SWNS)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA fugitive gangster has sent pals snaps of diamonds worth tens of thousands of pounds following a “charity mission” to Sierra Leone.

The little royal is celebrating his fifth birthday tomorrow, and the third in line to the throne is sure to have a lovely day. But how exactly do the youngest royals spend their special days? The royal family normally release a new photo of them to mark the occasion, but like any other kids they also have an exciting celebration away from the public eye. We\u0027ve taken a look back at how Prince George and Princess Charlotte have celebrated their birthdays so far.  Prince George First birthday Kate and Wills threw a \u0027low-key\u0027 tea party for their first born to mark his birthday at Kensington Palace. Guests began to arrive from 3pm, with Kate’s parents Carole and Michael pulling up first, followed by Kate and William’s former Principal Private Secretary Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, who is one of George’s seven godparents, carrying a brightly wrapped present. Kate’s brother James and sister Pippa, William’s cousin Zara Phillips and her husband Mike Tindall also attended. But great-granny the Queen was the guest of honour, arriving an hour after the party started in a green Bentley. As you do. Prince Philip was unable to attend, but Kate and Wills took little George to Buckingham Palace in the morning so he could see his great-granddad on his special day.  Wills and Kate issued a statement on the eve of their son’s birthday to thank everyone for their good wishes for George. They said: We would like to take this opportunity on George’s first birthday to thank everyone over the last year, wherever we have met them, both at home and overseas, for their warm and generous good wishes to George and our family. They also shared adorable new photos of him, taken at the Natural History Museum just before his big day. Second birthday Another year, another very royal party! By this point, Kate and Wills have moved to Anmer Hall in Norfolk, so held the celebrations there. They invited about a dozen youngsters to the party, as well as their close family. Many of the royals had to miss the event as they were on official duties, but William was given time off to celebrate.  Prince Philip also managed to make a surprise visit having missed the previous year\u0027s celebrations. The party lasted for about an hour and a half. And of course, another gorgeous photo. This time the family picked a picture of William holding George, who is leaning towards the camera with a huge cheeky grin on his face. Third birthday Kate and Wills released a series of new photos of the growing prince to mark the big number three. The royal family released four lovely pictures of George with the caption: Can\u0027t believe it\u0027s been three years already! In one of the photos, George is feeding the Cambridges\u0027 dog Lupo an ice cream.  Fourth birthday The prince spent the run-up to his big day on an official tour of Poland and Germany with his parents. During the trip the little royal was spotted beaming from ear to ear as he sat in the cockpit of a helicopter. Kate and William shared a photo of Prince George with a huge smile on his face to mark the birthday. Kensington Palace said in a statement: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to share a new official portrait of Prince George to mark His Royal Highness\u0027s fourth birthday tomorrow.  The photograph was taken at Kensington Palace at the end of June by Chris Jackson, Getty Images Royal Photographer. The Duke and Duchess are very pleased to share this lovely picture as they celebrate Prince George\u0027s fourth birthday, and would like to thank everyone for all of the kind messages they have received. Princess Charlotte First birthday The little princess celebrated her first birthday with a party at Anmer Hall in Norfolk. Guests included grandparents Prince Charles, and Carole and Michael Middleton. Kate and William released four new adorable photos of Charlotte playing happily at home to mark the occasion. One of the pictures, taken in the garden, shows her standing up while holding onto one of her toys.  A Kensington Palace spokesman said: The Duke and Duchess are delighted to share new photographs of Princess Charlotte. The Duchess took these pictures of her daughter in April at their home in Norfolk.  The Duke and Duchess are happy to be able to share these family moments, ahead of their daughter\u0027s first birthday. We hope that everyone enjoys these lovely photos as much as we do. Second birthday During her second year, we only saw little Charlotte a handful of times as her parents were keen to keep her out of the public eye. However they released another adorable photo of her to celebrate her birthday.

The pooch also feasts on steak for dinner and has a \u0026pound1,500 pram, with her doting owner Anthony Welsh, 57, having spent a whopping \u0026pound40,000 on her. The lucky Staffordshire Bull Terrier has just celebrated her seventh birthday, seeing Anthony, from Liverpool, splash out another \u0026pound1,000, on his beloved pet. Cleopatra was treated to the finest tennis balls, a posh feeding station and her very own custom-made mountain bike in honour of her special day.  She was then thrown her own beach party at the Marino Lounge dog-friendly cafe at New Brighton, on the Merseyside coast, along with her bulldog boyfriend, Frank, and Frank\u0027s owner, Toni Green. They enjoyed doggy birthday cake, doggy steak and partied with balloons and presents - which she opened herself by ripping off the wrapping paper with her mouth. The staffy has 65 outfits and 175 pairs of sunglasses, as well as the luxury pram so she doesn\u0027t get her paws dirty when out and about. With no partner or children, adorable black, white and brindle Cleo gets all of Anthony\u0027s attention - and he describes her as his daughter. He said: Cleo is just amazing, she really is one in a million. People may think I spoil her but she\u0027s like a daughter to me and if I have the means why not give her everything.  Superfit personal trainer Anthony lives a clean and healthy life and spends time and money so Cleo can have the same lifestyle. She is exercised daily both on foot and on her own mountain bike, which is specially adapted so she can ride along. Anthony buys only the best dog food for his pooch at around \u0026pound40 a bag and Cleo has three kids\u0027 sports cars - a 4x4, a convertible white sports car and a racing car, all at \u0026pound500 each. The preened pooch - who even goes for regular manicures - rides around in her vehicles in her countless outfits for every occasion and a number of tiaras.  Cleo, who Anthony describes as his world, is given a daily massage and has songs sang to her when it is time to go to bed. Anthony added: She makes me smile every single day. I feel love from Cleo every single day of the week. She\u0027s unbelievable. She\u0027s a legend. Anthony\u0027s obsession began when he rescued Cleo from being locked in a cage when she was just a year old.  Speaking about Cleo\u0027s tough start in life, Anthony said: We rescued her along with her mother when she was just a pup. She was so quiet and completely different to the larger than life character she is now. She was actually diagnosed with depression so I was on a mission to make her happy.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have dropped several hints about wanting to start a family since their wedding day, which has been getting royal fans extremely excited. As you\u0027d expect, there are lots of royal rules and protocol they\u0027ll have to follow if they do decide to start a family at some point in the future, like with all aspects of their lives. And it\u0027s not just parenthood which comes with royal traditions, and there are also lots of weird rules they must follow during the pregnancy. Prince William and Kate Middleton had to follow the rules (mostly) and it could be Harry and Meghan\u0027s turn soon.  Meghan probably won\u0027t have a baby shower It\u0027s a popular tradition in the UK and the US for friends and family of the expectant mum to thrown them a baby shower, with fun games and presents. But ABC News\u0027 expert Victoria Arbiter said baby showers weren\u0027t common in the royal family. She said: They are clearly very wealthy, and a lavish baby shower would be seen as highly inappropriate. There\u0027s nothing they can\u0027t go out and buy themselves. However there are reports that Kate Middleton\u0027s sister Pippa threw her a baby shower when she was pregnant with George. Overseas travel is limited All pregnant women are advised to avoid flying at the end of their pregnancy, and many airlines won\u0027t actually let them. But for the royals, this is much more strict and travel throughout the entire pregnancy is frowned upon. This probably wasn\u0027t a huge set-back for Kate and other pregnant women before her, but almost all of Meghan\u0027s family and friends live in America or Canada.  According to the Sun , pregnant royals are advised to keep travelling abroad to a minimum for safety reasons.  We didn\u0027t see Kate made as many overseas visits during when she was expecting, although she did go on a royal tour of Sweden and Norway when she was caring Prince Louis.  The sex will be a top guarded secret The gender of a royal baby isn\u0027t revealed until he or she makes their big arrival. Kate and Wills haven\u0027t known for any of their three children, even though people believed they dropped several hints during the pregnany.  A source told E! News : William and Kate don\u0027t know the sex of the baby, so they\u0027re rather looking forward to finding out.  It\u0027s very difficult to be totally prepared when you don\u0027t know if it\u0027s going to be a boy or a girl. A HUGE maternity team - who have to give up booze When Kate gave birth she had a massive team on hand to make sure everything went smoothly. Her dream team comprised of two obstetricians, three midwives, three anesthesiologists, four surgical staff members, two special care staffers, four pediatricians, one lab technician for blood tests, and three or four managers.

Happy and playful Daisy Dymyd had been playing with the two skipping ropes, which the inquest heard were her favourite toy, before the tragic accident. Her mum Charlotte had been doing some housework for around 30 minutes when she suddenly realised it was it was quiet upstairs. She went to check on Daisy and made the horrifying discovery at their home in Tuxford, Nottinghamshire. Daisy was freed by her mother who started chest compressions in an attempt to revive her.  Mrs Dymyd then dialled 999 for help and the phone operator gave her instructions as she continued CPR until a paramedic arrived to take over. Daisy was airlifted to Sheffield Children\u0027s Hospital but was pronounced dead a short time later, the hearing at Nottingham Council House heard today, Friday, July 20.  Assistant coroner for Nottinghamshire, Dr Elizabeth Didcock, concluded that it was an accidental death, reports Lincolnshire Live.  She told Daisy\u0027s father Luke: I extend my sincere condolences to you and those who knew Daisy. I am so sorry for your loss.  My findings are that there is absolutely no suspicion of any third party involvement. I wholeheartedly rule that out. There was no concern that she was anything other than a happy playful girl who enjoyed playing with toys. She liked to play horses and liked to play with animals. And she said the girl had not been left playing alone for a significant period of time. Evidence was given by detective chief inspector Peter Quinn, who was called in to investigate the incident, which took place in Daisy\u0027s home in Lincoln Road, Tuxford on February 18 this year.

The family of tragic Tom Channon, 18, were stunned to discover the walkway where Tom fell from has not been closed since the tragedy. John Channon, 67, and Ceri, 49, flew to Mallorca in a desperate attempt to understand what happened to the teenager, who fell to his death at the Eden Roc apartments as he made his way back to his hotel.  As The Safer Tourism Foundation is calling for the owners of the apartments in Torrenova to make immediate safety improvements, Tom\u0027s dad John said: It is a real danger it is a real hazard. You could lose your life here.  I think we feel it\u0027s an insult to Tom, it\u0027s and insult to what happened to Tom and his memory that five days on nobody had even been back to lock the gate to make some attempt to stop this happening again.  Tom is believed to have fallen 70ft from the walkway while trying to make his way through to the Hotel Florida where he was staying believing there was a garden the other side due to a huge amount of overgrowth. Jane Champ, whose son was also on the holiday with Tom, said: There\u0027s no safety sign to warn anyone of the dangers. There\u0027s just this low wall and actually if you look at it from a couple of steps back, you would just assume it was a garden but you peer over and its oblivion. Kelly Chamberlain, mum of another of Tom\u0027s friends said: If I could go over there now and just sit there every night to stop it happening, I would do. His death comes after bar worker Natalie Cormack West Kilbride, Scotland, fell from the Eden Roc apartment block in April after trying to make her way along an overhang after she discovered she didn\u0027t have keys to get in.   And last month Tom Hughes, 20, of Wrexham, North Wales, died at the same block - and MirrorOnline previously reported that he also fell to the ground.  Gardener Sergio Narvaet, who discovered Tom’s body last Thursday, three months after he also found Natalie’s body in similar circumstances, says that he thinks the boys must have become disorientated in the dark, while Natalie was trying to reach a friend’s apartment at Eden Roc.  He told the Mailonline : It is very dark here — they would not see the drop on the other side of the wall. My opinion is that the boys thought they were staying at the white hotel next door and tried to jump over the wall, but didn’t notice the drop.  John added: It is just so tragic because when you look at it it never needed to happen. Quite clearly if something had been done after the last accident this never would have happened.  I think it is the responsibility of tour operators, I think its the responsibility of hotels, it\u0027s the responsibility of everybody involved to try and get that message across. Tom didn\u0027t die in vain because if we can get this message across. Tom is believed to have left his group of school friends at around 4am on Thursday morning and police believe he may have got lost as he made his way home. After Tom’s death, local officials met British diplomats to discuss the problem, which comes just a month after tour operators’ association ABTA and the Foreign Office renewed their annual appeal for holidaymakers to avoid taking risks on hotel balconies. Town hall officials have also ordered the owners of the block to take action, asking for a fence to be erected within ten days.  Kathy Atkinson, CEO of the Safer Tourism Foundation said: “We are horrified by the tragic loss of life this year at the Eden Roc apartments in Magaluf. “No organisation with a conscience can sell a holiday or a long stay rental at this accommodation without immediate improvements being made. “Any UK based travel company selling this accommodation should use its contracting relationship to reinforce this requirement and should stop selling accommodation at Eden Roc if improvements are not made as a matter of urgency. “And hotels nearby should warn their guests not to stray into the Eden Roc, given the number of fatalities there this year.” Another mum, who asked not to be named, said: Something has to happen now. It shouldn\u0027t take all these kids dying to make sure proper precautions are in place.

German police were waiting on the runway when the flight landed, according to one passenger. It is understood the man and another woman were taken off the flight. He was abusive and aggressive and the pilot took the decision to detour to Munich where we waited on the runway while he was removed and laid out on the tarmac, the passenger said.  The passenger said a family with young children were moved up the plane for their safety as his language and aggression were terrible and the kids started crying. She added: The hostesses were serving drinks and had moved half way down the aisle when suddenly people stared looking over their seats toward the back. This happened a few times, then an air hostess raced down the aisle. A passenger stood up and supported the air hostesses trying to calm him. The staff moved a young family who were sat nearby up to the front. Then the flight started to go down but no one had announced anything. Air staff then asked us to buckle seat belts and a lady nearby asked why we were descending and she said she couldn\u0027t say and pilot would make announcement but it was nothing to worry about. The pilot then asked everyone to return to their seats for an emergency landing. We didn\u0027t know where we were until some passengers identified it was Munich. When we landed there were lots of police on the runway.

He also admitted to a final incident of sexual assault of her in 2010. Murphy is currently serving an eight-year sentence in Arbour Hill prison for previous sexual abuse charges, imposed last February at Castlebar Circuit Court.  Sophia, now 33, was aged between three and 16 years of age at the time of the majority of the offences, reports Irish Mirror. In her victim impact statement which she read to the court, she outlined that she wished to go public to encourage other people in her position to come forward. She said: “Silence protects the abuser and imprisons the victim. Take back your life break the silence. You are not a victim for sharing your story, you are a survivor.” Mr Justice Michael White noted the “length, intensity and depravity of the sexual abuse”.

Olga Solomina, 46, grinned as she knelt down and touched the lion\u0027s mane for the photograph at a safari park in Ukraine. But moments after the picture was taken, things took a turn for the worse when the animal reportedly grabbed her arm and \u0027dragged\u0027 her around. I squatted down and put my hand on the lion as I was told, Olga recalled. Next moment it grasped my arm and dragged me like a rag doll. Olga then lay there believing she was about to die at the Taygan safari park, located in the Crimea region.  She added: The other lions jumped to their feet. I closed my eyes in fear waiting to be torn apart by the pride. It lasted several seconds that felt like eternity for me. Zoo director Oleg Zubkov, who was nearby, came to her rescue by chasing the lions away. He then put her back in a opensided vehicle to drive her to the zoo offices. However the pair are now locked in a bitter battle over who is to blame and what happened next. Olga alleges that despite her horrific injuries, her arm was just wrapped in a towel. She claimed: He asked me not to call the police or an ambulance, saying that my injuries were not dangerous. At his office, his secretary treated my lacerations with hydrogen peroxide. Then a veterinarian came.  He injected me with lidocaine and stitched the wounds. Instead of anaesthetising me they gave me a bottle of cognac. They did not give me any antibiotics. She said that she was then driven home where, drunk from the cognac she had tried to sleep. However, over the next 24 hours her health condition worsened and she was in incredible pain. When her temperature escalated, she finally called an ambulance. Doctors diagnosed her with a serious infection caused from the bite. Hospital spokesman Nikolai Vlasov said: The infection got into her body from the teeth of the animal. It is a very dangerous infection. She underwent surgery. Her health condition became better, but she needs further treatment. At the moment it\u0027s still not clear if she will regain full usage of her arm.

There were gasps in the audience when the \u0027Bullet Man\u0027 flew through the air but missed the safety net and went hurtling towards the ground. Footage has captured the moment Jaime Almarza Quezada is blasted in the air and comes crashing onto the floor among the crowds. The 40-year-old father-of-two reportedly hit a clown who was knocked to the ground but was not hurt. Spectators went running over to help him after the drama unfolded.  The incident happened at the American Circus in the Arauco Maipu shopping centre in the Maipu district of the Chilean capital Santiago. Quezada was taken to hospital where he was treated for fractures to his jaw and knees. He is reportedly still under observation but in a stable condition. Luis Alvarez, the operator of the cannon, appeared to take the blame for the incident, telling local media: It was a mistake on my part, my apologies especially to the audience. I did not disconnect the air-supply hose and the compressor made the air return from the accumulator which then raised the pressure causing a longer distance than what is always programmed.

The Airlander 10, dubbed the flying bum for its unusual shape, will boast posh interiors akin to something off a sci-fi film or a luxury cruise ship.  The \u0026pound25 million aircraft is 92-metres-long and has a wingspan of just over 43 metres, Cambridgeshire Live reports.  Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV), it\u0027s manufacturer based in RAF Cardington, Beds., unveiled more information about the airship at the Farnborough Air Show on Friday.  Photos and footage of the prototype show its stunning observation lounge with a glass floor, luxurious altitude bar and private bedrooms. The Airlander 10 will accommodate 19 passengers, each using spacious en-suite cabins. And HAV, which has received funding from the UK government and EU grants, claims there is a market for as many as 500 of the beasts.  Stephen McGlennan, CEO of HAV, said: Airlander challenges people to rethink the skies – that’s the driving force behind everything we do. Air travel has become very much about getting from A to B as quickly as possible. What we’re offering is a way of making the journey a joy. The firm has teamed up with Design Q to detail the imagery for the newly-released video.

Shirley Potter got an eye infection after using the decades-old product she had in a drawer. She said she was unaware make-up carries an expiry date and it wasn\u0027t until her eye became sore she realised there was aproblem.  Now Ms Potter, from Adelaide, Australia, is expected to lose her eyesight within three years, according to Yahoo!7 .  Beauty expert Sally Nolan has warned against using out of date products - especially around the eyes.  She said: “A general rule of thumb is that product that you put around your eyes, they generally last about three to six months. Foundations and things like that, you can get about a year to 18 months out of them.” According to experts, if you are in doubt about how long you have had a product it\u0027s best to throw it away rather than take the risk. Earlier this year Theresa Lynch, 50, shared her story after finding out her sight was at risk from a common make-up habit.

Even Darren O’Dea has been helping me with my defending and Graham Gartland has helped a lot and every day I’m trying to learn.“If my chance comes I’ll back myself to do the best I can.”Curran came off the bench in the 4-0 win over Stirling last weekend and is hoping to make it appearance No 2 nice and quickly against the Pars on Sunday.He added: “Dunfermline have always been a strong team in the Championship, always competing to get promotion to the Premiership so it will be a good test after they beat Peterhead 3-0 the other night.“There was a great turnout to the Stirling game so, hopefully, we’ll get another good one this weekend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51aaeebafbd-480x564.jpg ","title":"betfred cup ties remain vital as dundee united work to get going","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor Dundee United, this season’s Betfred Cup looks all but over but don’t trying telling stand-in skipper Stewart Murdoch the final two group fixtures are meaningless.The 28-year-old knows today\u0026#8217s Tannadice clash with Alloa and next week’s trip to Elgin will be vital games as the Tangerines work to make sure they are a force in the coming Championship campaign.And while the ties so far against Arbroath and Ross County have ended in disappointment in terms of results, he believes they provided proof they’re heading in the right direction.“I think the thing is it’s really early doors and the manager will tell you we are still building, that’s maybe why we haven’t had the results we wanted,” he said.“We are still basically in a pre-season phase, so, for us, Tuesday was a really good competitive game up at County and gave us an opportunity to see exactly where we are right now.“It was another 90 minutes for the lads together and to help get to know each other. When you get the penalty at 0-0 and late on, if you score you probably go on and see out the game.“We didn’t and it was disappointing to lose but at the same time everybody could see the other night that already we can compete and we can take that forward. Now we move on to the next game.”And that need to be ready for next month’s league kick-off against Dunfermline means, for Murdoch and his team-mates, the next two outings are massive.“It will be difficult to qualify from our group now but we will take every game the same way we’ve always done and that’s as big ones.“We probably need to win both games now to have any chance and that’s what we’ll aim to do.“And they are another two big games leading into the start of the season in the Championship. We can get match sharpness and we will have another few boys who’ve had wee injuries back available.“It’s also another opportunity as well for the gaffer to maybe tinker with the team a bit and get boys some game time.”And, despite what the Betfred group table suggests, his belief this rebuilt United side is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the second tier, is growing.“I think everyone is confident we are building a good team and the manager will be wanting a few more players – I’m sure he’d said that.“I think the more good players we add the better we’ll play and the more we play together the better we’ll become.“It gave us confidence going to a place like County and competing the way we did. It was a good performance, it was just the result that was poor.“We are all excited about the season ahead and I think it’s going to be a positive one.”In the absence of newly-appointed club captain Fraser Fyvie, who’s likely to be out for another month or so as he completes his recovery from knee surgery at the turn of the year, the games so far have seen Murdoch wear the captain’s armband.Well aware of United’s history and some of the greats who’ve undertaken the role, he regards even having it on a temporary basis as a big feather in his cap.“I was captain a couple of times towards the end of last season and to be handed it again while Fraser is still out is nice,” he added.“This is a massive club, so to lead Dundee United out in any game is a huge honour for me.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba laszlo urging dundee united to speed up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo wants Dundee United to speed up when their Betfred Cup campaign continues at home to Alloa today.Despite a draw and a penalty shoot-out loss against Arbroath and a narrow defeat at Ross County in the two group ties so far, Csaba has been pleased with the signs coming from his rebuilt Tangerines.The next step forward he wants to see, though, is quicker use of the ball leading to more chances being created.“If I watch the team, Matej Rakovan, Adam Barton, Christoph Rabitsch, Callum Booth and others, they are really good football players,” he said.“They keep the ball well and have some good ideas, but we have to do more in the offence.“You can’t just control the game, you also have to go and finish, bring more danger in front of the opponent’s goal, be quicker.“I told them that for the second half at Ross County, ‘OK we are comfortable with the ball but we have to bring more danger’.”Fraser Aird will be in the squad after he sat out the County trip.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil mccann says craig wighton needed half time telling off","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann revealed Craig Wighton needed a proverbial kick up the backside at half-time in the weekend victory at Stirling – and he won’t be letting him “rest on” his talent in the future either.After going in at the break 1-0 to the good, Wighton’s second-half performance did show more urgency, with the 20-year-old delivering a telling cross for Sofien Moussa’s second and a classy finish himself.That strike was the Scotland U/21 international’s first since a 5-1 win over Motherwell way back in February 2017 after a serious knee injury curtailed much of the last campaign.And his manager is looking forward to seeing what Wighton can bring to the side in the season ahead.Neil said: “I’m delighted for him. It’s taken him a lot of time.“He went away with Scotland U/21s but he’s looked really fit in pre-season and you can see the quality he has.“I had a wee go at him at half-time because, for me, he was sitting on it, resting.“I don’t like people resting on ability like that and I think second half he was much more of a threat.”The Dens boss has also revealed he will continue to rotate the captaincy in the upcoming games after Genseric Kusunga wore the armband at Stirling.“I think it’s good they all get a wee bit of a shot and feel they can hold that responsibility.“The armband really isn’t that important to me so I’ll probably continue to do that throughout the League Cup.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/DN7D1449.JPG-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fans and tottenham teammates turn out to pay respects to football legend alan gilzean","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFans and former teammates paid tribute to Dundee icon Alan Gilzean on Friday as the legendary striker made his final journey past Dens Park.Supporters young and old braved the rain as the hearse carrying the title-winning forward drove up Sandeman Street just before midday.The ex-Dark Blues and Tottenham Hotspur star died earlier this month aged 79, just weeks after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.Among those to attend his funeral at Dundee Crematorium were several of his ex-Spurs teammates, including Pat Jennings and Alan Mullery.About 80 supporters gathered outside the stadium to pay their respects.Mark Kerr, 64, originally from Lochee, travelled down from Inverness to bid farewell to Mr Gilzean, who he said was one of his heroes.He said: “I was at Dens when Dundee won the league.“I was seven years old and I remember it distinctly.“I watched him playing in Europe and it confirmed I wanted to be a Dundee supporter for life.“I saw Alan at a hall of fame dinner at the Invercarse recently, so I was shocked to hear of his passing.“I’m the chairman of the Highland Dark Blues. I’ve come down from Inverness to pay my respect, and I’ll be raising a drink in his memory tonight.”Born in Coupar Angus, Gilzean is considered one of the finest players to grace Dens Park and netted an unrivalled 169 goals during the halcyon days of the 1950s and 60s.His eye for a goal was a crucial factor in Dundee’s title-winning season in 1961-62, before the club went on to reach the semi-final of the European Cup.Season ticket holder George McLaren, 73, said: “He has been such a big part of Dundee FC. My favourite memories of him are probably the goals against Dundee United.“I was shocked to hear of his passing and wanted to come here today to pay my respects. He will never be forgotten. He proved himself here at Dens and at Spurs.“An absolute legend for both clubs.”Fellow fan Daniel Smith, 33, from Maryfield, added: “There’s been a good turnout of people paying their respects here today at Dens.“He is a Dundee legend. I grew up on stories about Gilzean through the years and the things he accomplished at Dens. He still holds a number of records at Dens Park.”A tribute on the Dundee FC website stated: “Everyone at Dundee Football Club was devastated to learn of the death of Dundee legend Alan Gilzean aged 79 after a short illness.“A true Dundee legend in every sense of the word, we may never see his goal scoring like again and the thoughts of everyone at Dens Park are with Alan’s family and friends at this difficult and sad time.”He made the jump from Tayside to Tottenham in 1964 for a £72,500 fee, lifting two League Cups, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup.As well as the dark blue of Dundee, Hall of Famer Gilzean earned 22 Scotland caps between 1963 and 1971, bagging 12 goals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51aab022de5-e1532091100625-751x564.jpg ","title":"dundee kiltwalk stet for biggest year as 2000 signed up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee\u0026#8217s Kiltwalk is set for its biggest year yet — with all the signs pointing towards a record number of walkers for 2018.Paul Cooney, chief executive of the Kiltwalk, said the number of sign-ups was close to 2,000 with four weeks to go until the big day — almost the same number of people who took part last year.He met up with members of the Tay Road Bridge Joint Board and Dundee United midfielder Scott Allardice to launch the new start point of the five-mile Wee Wander.It’s one of three routes walkers can choose to complete, and follows the banks of the Tay from the refreshed urban art space underneath the road bridge to Monifieth.All three walks take place on Sunday August 19 — with the start points at the Tay Road Bridge, Tayport and St Andrews — and any registered charity can be supported.At the end of the Kiltwalk, all funds raised are given a massive 40% boost by the Hunter Foundation, run by philanthropist Sir Tom Hunter.The Kiltwalk takes no cut of the cash raised — instead funding the events through registration fees, which means every penny raised goes direct to good causes.Paul said: “Dundee has been brilliant with us. This year, we’re closing in on 2,000 people with four weeks to go, and last year we had 2,000 people taking part.“It’s a brilliant way of raising money for your chosen charity. We’re very lucky to have Sir Tom Hunter supporting us, boosting your fund by 40%.“It’s a great way of raising un-restricted funds for local charities.“People still ask what causes they can support and the answer is simply any registered charity — and they will all get the 40%.“There’s still time to sign up but if you’re thinking of doing the 25-mile walk, I’d start training now.”The Tele is continuing backing Dundee’s Kiltwalk as a great way of raising money for good causes across Tayside — a fact that has not gone unnoticed.Paul added: “I have to thank the Evening  and its readers for their support.“It’s made such a difference for us and I can’t overstate the importance of DC Thomson, and the Evening  especially, to what we do here in Dundee.”United star Scott added: “It’s all for a good cause and it’s not every day you can say you’ve been for a walk of up to 25 miles. I’m keeping my fingers crossed for everyone that we get good weather.”As part of its partnership with the Tay Road Bridge Joint Board, the Kiltwalk team devised a road bridge ‘takeover’.Bridge staff have hung flags and banners promoting the Kiltwalk along the length of the crossing.Bridge manager Alan Hutchison said: “With the new space available to all the people of Dundee and the wider community it made sense to lend it to the Kiltwalk.”West End Liberal Democrat councillor and joint board member Fraser Macpherson said: “We’re all very supportive of the Kiltwalk and all the funds it raises for charities across Scotland.“It’s great to see the bridge staff taking such a proactive approach to getting involved and it’s fantastic that there’s such great support for it here in Dundee.”There’s still time to sign up for Dundee’s Kiltwalk — go online to thekiltwalk to find out more.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4f07435f2ed-912x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people alyx set for world stage","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Monifieth street dancer is to represent Scotland on the world stage.Alyx Gray, 11, is through to the under-12 beginner/novice category at the UDO World Championships at the Hydro in Glasgow.She will also represent the country at the European Championships in the Netherlands next year.Alyx qualified after becoming Scottish champion.The former Seaview Primary pupil, who starts at Monifieth High this year, began dancing aged seven.She is coached by Laura Nisbet, who runs the Addicted 2 Dance studio in Dundee.Mum Jody said: “We are chuffed to bits.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united set

kerr","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee favourite Cammy Kerr has called on the club’s supporters to give Alan Gilzean the send off the Dens legend deserves this weekend.The Dark Blues take on Dunfermline this Sunday in the first home game since Gilzean passed away at the age of 79.The club legend’s funeral takes place tomorrow and Sunday’s clash promises to be one full of emotion for everyone associated with Dundee.A special matchday programme will be available while there will be a minute’s silence and black armbands worn by the players but Kerr expects a bumper home crowd to give Gilzean a roaring send-off.The 22-year-old said: “It’s a terrible thing to happen.“Sadly, I never got to see him play or have the privilege of meeting him but what a figure to have played at this football club.“To know you are at the same football club as some of the greatest footballers have played at is fantastic.“I’d like to send my regards and best wishes to his family at this time, obviously a tough time.“In terms of the game, I think it will be emotional and, hopefully, the crowd turn out for a very special player for this football club.“I’ve read a few of things in the papers about the player he was and I actually remember watching the thing on TV at White Hart Lane when they closed the old stadium.“I knew he was a good player but I didn’t know how big he was for Tottenham.“When they said ‘The Original King of White Hart Lane, Alan Gilzean’ it just shows the regard he was held in down there.“Naming a lounge after him doesn’t do him justice because he was, obviously, a great talent.”Being a fan himself, Kerr knows the kind of supporters Dundee have and the loyalty they show their team – something he experienced in a very noisy welcome and send-off at last week’s friendly against Farense in Portugal.“We could hear them when we got off the bus in Albufeira but you can’t see how many there were,” Kerr added.“At the end I got a few photos and things and they were singing away.“The best bit was when we were leaving and they were all banging on the bus – it was great!“You see European games and all the fans waiting on the buses so it felt like that, it felt great.“For the fans to go across there just shows the loyalty that they’ll go across to Portugal for a friendly. That’s fantastic to see.“I gave away a pair of my boots and I think someone had them on running about the streets about 10 minutes later!”Allan Johnston’s Pars side will be looking to spoil Dundee’s return to the newly-named Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park by putting themselves into pole position in Betfred Cup Group D.And Kerr knows the Dark Blues will have to be right on their game to see off a Dunfermline side that swept past Peterhead in midweek.He added: “The game is on the TV as well which is good and the pitch is coming on really well, too. The groundsmen do a great job to give us a good pitch.“It’s always good to come out and have a game on the TV, it’s exciting, but Dunfermline are a side that will definitely try to push this year.“They’ve made some really important signings throughout their side and they’ll be a really tough test, so we’ll have to be firing on all cylinders.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/chelsea4.jpg-e1532095520810-772x564.jpg ","title":"inspirational dundee woman chelsea hoping mentor others and help to change their lives","story":"\t\t\t\t\tShe is the inspirational young woman whose harrowing open letter to her drug addict parents thrust her on to the national stage and led to her sharing a platform with the first minister.Now Young Scot of the Year Chelsea Cameron wants to use her experiences to mentor others and offer them the chance to do life-changing voluntary work.Chelsea, 20, a former head girl at Menzieshill High School, made headlines in January last year after she wrote to mum Tammy and dad Alexander about her upbringing in Menzieshill.Chelsea with First Minister Nicola SturgeonShe described her parents’ behaviour and the devastating impact drug addiction could have on families.Her life has changed dramatically since then and now she wants other young people to be given experiences and skills to build themselves a future.Chelsea, who works as a PA, said: “I’m looking to informally mentor and give a voluntary opportunity to a young person between the ages of 16-20.“If it turns out that I get a huge response I will need to sit down and work out how to make the selection.“It may be possible to take on more than one young person initially – maybe a boy and a girl.“Over the past year I’ve had so many opportunities to attend great events and meet so many incredible people that I used to think were so far out of my reach.“As Young Scot of the Year, I’m committed to helping another young person to have opportunities to broaden their horizons and realise the world is their oyster.“I attend many events ranging from speaking to young people, policy makers, politicians and everything in between – there was even royalty once.”Chelsea added: “I have given this a lot of thought and would love to hear from people who think they would like to take up this opportunity.“I feel a responsibility to do something to help someone else in the way I have been helped.“Along the way, I’d hope this young person develops self- confidence, good communication, presentation and public speaking skills, time management and how to prioritise.“This is a fantastic chance to develop some skills and build networking opportunities that can be advantageous for future employment.“All of this is combined with lots of fun and plenty of chocolate cake. If I can give another young person the opportunities I’ve been given, why would I pass it up?”Chelsea said she would love to identify a suitable candidate by next month.She added: “I have a lot of

charities,” she said.“If this is something you would love to do, please send a short piece about yourself and why you feel this would be a good opportunity for you to Chelsea-cameron@hotmail.”After her letter was made public, Chelsea was invited to London to appear on television and radio, beginning with the Victoria Derbyshire show.She was also interviewed on various news programmes and within

for old iconic dundee pie shop site","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA famous Dundee pie shop bakery left to decay for more than 40 years is to be transformed into a quirky new home.The Auld Dundee Pie Shop at 18-20 Castle Street, which served up the famous Wallace peh, was a household name in the city from the turn of the 20th Century until it closed down in the late 1970s.Owned by David Wallace, it was once part of a string of pie shops run by the family, also featuring a restaurant named Wallace’s Tea Rooms.Dundee-based Castle Development has now been granted planning permission to convert the C-listed bakehouse at the back of the former shop and tearooms into a two-bedroom home.The development will add to the ongoing conversion of the adjacent St Paul’s Church, which is being transformed from a pub into residential accommodation.The business originally opened in 1892 in the Vault under the Caird Hall, an area now being converted into trendy restaurants such as the recently-opened Brassica.In the early 1920s Mr Wallace moved to the building on Castle Street, when the Vault was due for demolition, as the building was big enough to open the tearoom as well as the two-floor bakehouse.During the Second World War it is reported the queues for pies and bridies used to stretch down to the bottom of the street as they were able to supplement the meat ration. Now hidden from street view, the bakehouse has not been used since it closed 41 years ago, in 1977.A pend between two shops allows access from the street, which then opens up into a large courtyard and the entrance to the bakery.A design statement submitted by RDA Architects, on behalf of Castle Development, says the history of the building will be incorporated.It states: “The proposals seek to highlight the historic elements on the replacement elevation highlighting the area from which the dilapidation began, visibly documenting the history of the site and ensuring the preservation of the remaining structure.“The materials have been carefully considered against the context of the former bakery, its perceived history and gradual dilapidation and eventual demolition of its western elevation.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"social enterprise conference to be held in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn event aimed at promoting social enterprise in Tayside and Fife is being planned.The inaugural Tayside and Fife Social Enterprise Conference will be held in Dundee this autumn.A spokesman for Dundee City Council said: “Having teamed up with our partners Dundee Social Enterprise Network, Perth and Kinross Association of Voluntary Service and Perth and Kinross, Angus and Fife councils, we are looking to attract about 150 delegates from third, public and private sector organisations from across the regions with an exciting conference programme.“The conference focus will be inclusive growth, welcoming influential keynote speakers such as Will Tyler-Greig, head of social enterprise, social innovation and investment at the Scottish Government, and Aiden Pia, executive director at Senscot, with more speakers to be announced in the coming weeks.“There will be the opportunities for social enterprises to enter our awards.“The categories are best new start-up – under two years, best innovative idea, best social impact, best growth business and young social entrepreneur.”Nominations for the awards will open in August, with the winners being announced at the conference.Anyone wanting more information about the conference and sponsorship opportunities should email elaine.cox@dundeecity.gov.uk or admin@dundeesen.org.The conference will be held in the city’s Apex Hotel.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4f0793923bf-771x564.jpg ","title":"stirling albion or celtic its all the same to dundee new boy jean mendy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn his very short time at Dundee, Senegalese striker Jean Mendy has already shown he can get fans off their seats at Dens Park this season.And he plans to continue doing that – as well as getting goals – whether he’s playing against Stirling Albion or Celtic, it’s all the same to him.He told the Tele: “I don’t know the teams at the moment!“For me, playing Stirling is like playing against Celtic, it’s the same for me – I just play my game, it doesn’t matter, and try to win every game.”The 28-year-old was delighted to start his career in dark blue with a goal after he knocked in a good strike from the edge of area as his new team began the season with a morale-boosting 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion.“It was good and we won of course – it’s very important to start winning,” Mendy added.“It was a little bit hot, I think, on the pitch on Saturday, we could feel it.“The performance was good, can be better you know, it was the first game but it was good to get the confidence with this game.“It was great for the team to score a lot of goals and we have shown we have people who can score.“I was pleased to get the goal, I got the chance and I put it in.“It was perfect for me to start with a goal and good for my confidence so I’m very happy to start like this.”Mendy joined the club from Belgian top-flight side Lokeren where he struggled to make an impact.That was after piling in the goals in the Norwegian lower leagues.Back in 2012, he banged in 27 goals in 25 league games for Elverum in the third tier before 27 in 52 in the next tier for Kristiansund. A move up to the top flight only brought a return of six in 23 for Sandefjord before returning to Kristiansund and then getting the big move to Belgium.Manager Neil McCann said he’d been keeping an eye on Mendy’s progress after missing out on him when he departed Norway.He’s finally got his man and the forward is delighted to be at Dundee, even if he’s not spent much time in the city with the club spending a week-long training camp in Portugal.He said: “I’ve enjoyed my time so far, it’s a good club with good players, too, and I think this year will be a good one.“Portugal was a lot of training.

Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone. I think it is a good project and if necessary I will be the first to dip my toe in the water there.\"Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"This has had youth engagement all along and I think it is something that is going to sit well in the environment of a place that will become even more popular as people engage with the river.\"Masterminding the project is Bespoke Atelier, a Glasgow-based design studio.Its design statement, which will be discussed at a planning meeting later this summer, explains the lades and weirs already around the River Ness were used as inspiration. The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116731.jpg","title":"New cinema proposed for the Black Isle","story":"\u0026nbspA THRIVING film society on the Black Isle looks set to take its next big step after plans were submitted for a permanent cinema to cater for growing demand.The brand new cinema, which would be located on the seafront in Cromarty, will cater to Cromarty and Resolis Film Society events and serve as a base for the town\u0027 increasingly popular annual film festival.Cromarty Estate, which owns the land, has lodged the application in partnership the film society, which would act as its tenant.The plans feature two key elements. The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.The cinema would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0027 growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country late every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.In a supporting statement submitted by the estate alongside its application, its agents said: \"A dedicated cinema space will allow screening all year which currently is not possible using existing buildings with poor black out facilities.\"The cinema may also be available for other users to hire for screenings, presentations and lectures.\"They added that the cinema would also \"ideally\" feature an outdoor area \"for summer screenings and festival events\".Making the case for new office space in the town, the estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"In a statement supporting the application, the film society said that a survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.Justifying the decision to proceed with an all-new site for the cinema, the estate\u0027 agents said the site\u0027 position close to adequate parking and its location away from homes were both positives, as was the existing vehicle access from the harbour.The buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.If the plans are approved construction could start as early as spring next year.Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:35

It is in the right location.”Exhibition documents said the preferred option has the least impact on the environment, would reduce delays and was the cheapest of the three possibilities.It was announced in January 2016 the road upgrade would be part of £504m of investments allocated to the north-east to improve infrastructure and attract jobs.Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity Michael Matheson said: “Having put a number of options for the planned improvements at Laurencekirk on display last year and considered the feedback following the public exhibition, we are now able to let the public see and comment on the preferred option that has been identified for this much-needed upgrade.“The plans on display will help reduce accidents and delays by preventing traffic turning or crossing at the busy A90 junction to the south of the town.“This will be achieved by grade-separating it which will also improve safety and accessibility for all active travel users.“I would encourage as many people as possible to attend the exhibitions to see the preferred option or view the material online and give us their views.“All comments we receive will be considered as we develop the preferred option in greater detail and look to publish draft orders for the scheme in 2019.”Aberdeenshire Lord Provost Bill Howatson, who represents the Mearns, said: “I think this is long overdue and we have been waiting for this for some time, but this is a positive step forward.“It still has to go through due process but with all going well and all boxes being ticked work could start in 2020 or 2021.”Councillor Jeff Hutchison, who represents the Mearns ward, said: “There is still a small consultation to go but I am happy with the junction that has come forward and the residents also seem happy. It is a horrendous junction and this is a step in the right direction and allows the town to move on and plan its future.”Fellow ward councillor Leigh Wilson said: “After speaking to members of the public they appear to be happy with the preferred option.“This is a positive move for Laurencekirk.”Mearns councillor George Carr said: “It will be welcomed by the community.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

John\u0026#8217s 72 was the best gross score on the day with Peter Mclean Jnr moving into third place when he recovered from a horror start to post a 76.The handicap trophy was another tight affair with Jimmy MacNab showing the youngsters how it is done with a superb net 64 taking a one shot lead over David Ronald and a two-shot lead over James Smyth.The John Reid Quaich which is played as part of the championship was won by Duncan Johnstone on 134, edging out Iain Macalister by one shot.Despite the weather conditions, the members gathered in good spirits for the final round of the championship, a day that everyone looks forward to and with all competitions very close an interesting days play lay ahead.In the leading group, play was a bit nervy with neither player at their best on the front nine with Iain reducing the deficit to one shot with eight holes left to play. John got one back at the 11th and then another two at the 12th before a birdie at the 14th pretty much saw him home and dry.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a look at the advertiser of yesteryear","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 11:54 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowWith the success of the Islay Mòd still fresh in our minds, it is clear that taking part in regional and the national Mòd is a long-standing tradition for Mid Argyll youngsters.For more than 20 years Mid Argyll students have done us proud at the Gaelic singing competitions, as seen here in our edition from 1998, when singers from all over Argyll made their way to the Royal National Mòd on the Isle of Skye.The Lochgilphead Primary Gaelic Choir came fourth in their competition, with the Lochfyneside Junior Gaelic Choir gaining top music mark in their unison singing competition.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema paradiso as screen machine parks up in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA familiar large blue lorry rolled into Lochgilphead recently, offering the latest movies to the public for two nights.The cinema on wheels parked itself outside Kilmory resource centre for movie buffs to enjoy on Tuesday July 10 and Wednesday July 11, with screenings of Gnomeo and Juliet sequel, Sherlock Gnomes superhero epic Avengers: Infinity War Part I and LGBT rom-com, Love, Simon.The Screen Machine has a busy few weeks ahead.

It is also the story of a family trying to reunite cousins on both sides of the Atlantic.Except this is not fiction. This is the mysterious story of James Campbell Hay Robertson, known as Jim, who was born and raised in Lochgilphead, and who was so determined to make a fresh start in America that he never saw or spoke to his Scottish family again.Why Jim would cut himself off from his family is something his granddaughter Morgan has been trying to find out and she has asked the Argyllshire Advertiser to help solve this mystery.James Campbell Hay Robertson was born in Lochgilphead and lived in Calman Villa in Ardrishaig. He was the son of the schoolmaster, a noted talent on the Lochgilphead football team and an aspiring doctor. Born in 1896, he had just turned 18 when the Great War began. He enlisted and, when the call for new officer candidates came, he signed up, becoming a \u0026#8216temporary gentleman\u0026#8217 rising to the rank of acting captain in charge of a battery of 4.5-inch Howitzers at the Ypres front. When the war ended, he spent six months in the army occupying Germany near Bonn.Jim was a smart boy, who loved his parents, and he was especially fond of his older sister Alexandria – a very talented pianist. She is often mentioned in the Advertiser as leading musical events in Lochgilphead, and was known as \u0026#8216Miss Lala Robertson\u0026#8217. According to Jim, she went off to study piano around 1910 in London or Edinburgh, but returned to Lochgilphead by the time the Great War broke out.After the war, Jim left for America and banished all of them from his life. It is here the mystery begins: what caused Jim to turn his back on his family and keep their existence hidden, from leaving Scotland in 1921 until his death in 1995 at the age of 99?Jim had a long and happy marriage and he and his wife Ruth had four boys who have grown up without extended family and under the impression that no relations existed in Scotland, which is not true. On a visit to Lochgilphead, Morgan found cousins in Furnace.Jim did share some clues about his family, but they were not all they seemed. He said his older brother William was in the Navy during the Great War, but had become an alcoholic, fallen overboard and drowned. This was not true. William\u0026#8217s signature was on their mother\u0026#8217s death certificate, signed in Aberdeen in 1943. William clearly lived a long life after Jim left Scotland and perhaps had his own family, themselves unaware of their American relatives.Jim\u0026#8217s telling of Alexandra\u0026#8217s story is even more tragic, saying she volunteered as a nurse in the war, fell in love with a South African soldier and left for Cape Town, only to die of food poisoning six months after arriving. This too was false, as the Advertiser\u0026#8217s obituary for their father in 1926 stated he \u0026#8216is survived by three children\u0026#8217, including Alexandra. Part of the story was true, however, as the Advertiser noted in 1920 that she married Henry Beck of Cape Town, in Dorset.Why Jim wanted to make a clean break with his family to such a degree he pretended his brother and sister had died will never be known. But it is possible his brother and sister lived long lives and had large families. Jim\u0026#8217s family in the United States now amounts to three surviving children, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.Jim\u0026#8217s father, William Robertson, came from a family of printers and dyers in Bonhill, Vale of Leven, and served as a schoolmaster from 1883 to 1920.

Council bosses have sized up the task, fearing the iconic structure has reached the end of the line. Large parts of Ayr railway station are closed to the public as safety teams comb the site. But the Post has learned that even a short-term salvage mission will cost more than \u0026pound300,000. Senior councillors have been briefed to expect a hefty hit to the wallet. South Ayrshire bosses will bid to retrieve whatever they spend from the hotel’s absentee Malaysian owner. But a senior adminsitration source said: “We have to face the reality of the situation. “The cost of refurbishing the hotel would be well in excess of \u0026pound10m, so that’s a non-starter. “I think that knocking it down is quickly becoming our only option.” That prospect is likely to face a strong challenge from groups such as Historic Scotland. And political tensions could further complicate the picture.  It comes as the hotel’s safety cordon was extended to take in part of the road over the railway. Teams are inspecting the condition of the building’s gable end amid concerns it could collapse on to people and cars below. Trains continue to run as normal, but access for commuters has now become fraught with difficulty. And worried rail chiefs are now said to be hatching contingency plans, should Ayr become become a no-go zone. But council bosses this week refused to confirm whether an official briefing on demolition had taken place. In a statement, they said: “Work to fully assess the condition of the former Station Hotel is continuing on site. “However, a decision on any future action will be dependent on the findings of the ongoing works and surveys.” But the council’s opposition group claim they are being kept in the dark over developments. Tory boss, Martin Dowey, said the public need to be kept informed. “I’m surprised this figure appears to be being quoted by members of the administration,” he added. “The SNP’s claim of inclusion and transparency is just one more empty promise. “The public need to be kept informed about the hotel and the council’s plans for its future, if that does indeed involve demolition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHistoric ScotlandScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTransportAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12945474.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_110718WINDOW_01JPG.jpg","title":"ayr window cleaner keith mckissock","story":"NewsAyr window cleaner Keith McKissock says South Ayrshire Council parking wardens are \"stopping\" him from workingFurious Keith McKissock claims he is being \"stopped\" from going about his business in Ayr town centre.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson10:49, 19 JUL 2018NewsKeith has won support from customers and some councillors (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA popular window cleaner claims council bosses are blocking his bid to work. Keith McKissock washes up to 50 properties – many of them businesses – in Ayr town centre. But the dad-of-two faces a stand-off with parking wardens on his tail. Keith, who runs Craigie Cleaning Services, wants a special permit allowing his van into town. But despite offers to pay an annual fee, red tape and fines have dogged his progress. The 53-year-old said: “I’m just trying to go about my work – what I do actually improves the town. “If I wasn’t cleaning these windows, would the council? “I can’t carry 22 litres of water on my back with all my ladders. “Maybe they expect me to balance everything on my bike.”  Keith, once a top Scottish cyclist, was backed all the way by customers this week. Kenny McLachlan, of Ayr, said: “Keith’s been washing our windows for five years and you couldn’t meet a harder working guy. “The High Street needs all the support it can get – we shouldn’t be harassing people doing it a turn.”  Now Tory councillors are  hoping to ride to the cleaner’s rescue by proposing a new parking charter.  Group chief Martin Dowey said: “Examples exist in other councils where they charge an annual window cleaner permit. “Keith is someone who legitimately services our High Street and there needs to be a common sense solution.” Ayrshire’s roads boss Stewart Turner said: “Vehicles can’t remain in the same location for longer than 10 minutes without activity. “In addition, it is not possible to move a vehicle from one bay to another in attempt to buy time. “In Mr McKissock’s case, he can use the bays to undertake cleaning operations but can’t use them to park or collect money from customers. “He was recently asked to move his vehicle from a bay by a parking attendant as he was not carrying out any window cleaning activities. “The Alliance wrote to Mr McKissock, once again, regarding his behaviour towards our parking attendants. “Our employees deserve to be treated with respect and we have a responsibility to protect them.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"former wwe star hurricane tops","story":"NewsFormer WWE star The Hurricane tops bill as Pro Wrestling Elite stages anniversary show at Ayr CitadelPWE will stage their latest extravaganza - and are promising fans one of their biggest and best shows yet.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:03, 19 JUL 2018NewsPWE will stage their big event this weekend (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrappling fans are in for a treat this weekend as a host of wrestling stars will descend on Ayr.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

Catherine also works in the entertainment industry as a photobooth attendant for Foxy Photo booths. The couple are from Irvine and have two kids together, David, 9, and Darcy, 2. The pair met on a night out in November 2013 in Irvine town. Catherine said: “We exchanged numbers and the rest was history. “We dated for several months before Jamie settled into family life with my little boy David and since then the two of them have been inseparable.” The couple tied the knot on Friday, June 8 at the Gailes Hotel.  “We had a Rugby Glam theme with lots of sparkle,” said Catherine. “We had centre pieces with feathers, rugby balls going down the aisle and silver sparkly table covers. “My son David wrote and shared a reading at the ceremony, which no one knew about, for Jamie about how he has made his mum so happy and how he is proud that this man is his step dad. The bride wore a strapless princess ballgown with cathedral train and sparkly cathedral veil. The 32 layered dress was MoriLee from J’Taime Bridal in Stevenston. The groom and groomsmen wore full kilt attire from Kilts4U in Kilmarnock. The wedding party consisted of Maid of honour, auntie of the bride Anna Marie Darroch Bridesmaid, best friend Emma Sneddon Flowergirl, daughter Darcy Doolan Bride’s parents Luigi and Julie Coppola Best man, best friend Aaron Robertson Ushers, Craig Wilson and David Darroch, Page boy, son David and Groom’s parents Jim Doolan and Una Doolan.

Hugh McFedries Photography and Magic Memories Videography captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. Flowers were arranged by Myra Craigen @ Balloons and Blooms and their cake created by Not Just Cake, Bellshill. Catherine said: “It was six tiers of white and sparkle- exactly what I had envision on my day. “It was made with different flavours but the Irn Bru and Toffee layers were our favourite.  Hair and Make-up was styled and created by Forever Diamonds, Prestwick Catherine added: “Hair and make up and all things beauty were done by my cousin Sean Diamond’s salon. His team worked very hard to give us exactly what we wanted. “We can not thank all our suppliers enough - but to the venue Gailes Hotel, the effort the staff put in down to every detail and ensuring everything ran on time and smoothly . “Also, our Venue dresser John at LG Wedding and events he made everything look so magical and sparkly, this guy is a miracle worker. “As I work in the industry and have met many brides over time, it was such a strange feeling having the day being about me and having my very own photobooth and marryoke that my boss Marc from Foxy Photobooth provided. “All my guests loved it and the marryoke video ‘She is a belter’ has hit 5k views.” For more photos of Catherine and Jamie\u0027s wedding, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

And the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block. For Tam and Isa actors in Still Game - Mark Cox and Jane McCarry - were among those clinking champagne glasses. It was staged at his country mansion near Dailly which has become the Scottish seat of Ferguson. The party follows shooting of his new movie has been filmed in Argyll. Along with 140 cast and crew he was staying near Arochar while filming for ‘Love You To Death’ at locations around Argyll and Bute.  Stars include male lead Craig, Craiglang favourite Ford Kiernan and Liz Hurley Producer Matthew Weiner - the creator of the hit TV series Mad Men, said: “Our experience of filming in Argyll and Scotland as a whole has been phenomenal, we have never felt so welcomed and supported as Americans.” Sources say the party was a grand affair, with “lots of great people.” One guest said: “Craig really put on a show and his house is incredible. “As well as actors some of the Ayrshire gentry were there. They had a ball . . . and it was so funny to see ‘Tam and Isa’ there. “Craig is a huge fan of Still Game and appeared in it alongside Jane and Mark. “While Jane and Mark had no problem fitting in to the glamour surroundings, Tam and Isa would have been completely overawed.”  Craig bought his Ayrshire property for \u0026pound2million cash six years ago, bidding over the \u0026pound1.85m asking price. The 56-year-old was once the highest earning talk show host in the US, taking home \u0026pound8m a year. He fell in love with the mansion in the Girvan Valley and was keen to have a Scots base for his three sons. The house is 336 years old and has 14 receptions and 15 bedrooms over four floors. But it also boasts facilities fit for a Hollywood superstar with cinema, games room, billiard room, gym and tennis court. Craig has kept a low profile since, but four years ago popped up to watch the panto at the Ayr Gaiety with the family and wife Megan. Amazingly he actually trod the Gaiety boards 20 years ago in a touring show, starring with the late Gerard Kelly in ‘The Odd Couple.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"vandal hunt after cars vandalised","story":"NewsVandal hunt after cars are vandalisedNeighbours are furious about old cars the owner refuses to move\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston12:29, 18 JUL 2018Updated12:33, 18 JUL 2018NewsFour motors are always parked at Raithhill (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIT’S a highly curious tale that’s causing unrest in an Alloway neighbourhood. A line of four cars all belonging to the same man have hardly turned a wheel for more than a DECADE. The road beneath them is a weed and dirt splattered state, tarnishing the pleasant surroundings of the horseshoe-shaped Raithhill. Every year the forlorn fleet is removed with the help of the AA to ensure they get their MOT and are road legal. And when they are away, a reserve takes their place in case someone else grabs the spot. Last week the story emerged as the cars’ owner Derek Cumming - who runs a chartered accountancy business in Ayr - told police his cars had been vandalised. Police then issued a statement saying the damage had been of “significant financial impact on the owners of these vehicles.” Ayr CID said they are “speaking to the community and reviewing CCTV” and added damage happened between May 1 and June 26. But far from sympathy from residents who insisted the cars were a menace and claimed Mr Cumming couldn’t care less about the annoyance they caused. Neighbours claimed Mr Cumming does not stay in the villa, which was owned by his late mother, and that he lives in nearby Glenalla Crescent. Meanwhile, the cars remain at Raithhill. Usual residents are an 18-year-old silver AUDI TT convertible, two Mercedes SL500’s aged 10 and 11 and usually a Range Rover rather than the 16-year-old Toyota Avensis. On closer inspection there is no significant vandalism to the four cars currently there other than a few minor scrapes and scratches. The Audi and the red Mercedes have small scrapes to the pavement side which look like it has been “keyed.” The Mercedes also has a small panel missing next to the rear window. Residents queued-up to tell the Ayrshire Post of their displeasure. One lady said: “You won’t get any sympathy for him here. Nobody can understand what he is playing at and he doesn’t care he causes us upset.” Another lady added: “In the winter when there is ice it is actually dangerous as we don’t want to hit his cars. “There is grass growing through the tarmac as the council road sweeper cannot get to it. “The so-called vandalism looks nothing to me . . . in fact if that is all there has been in 10 years then he should count himself lucky. “It was his mother’s house and his aunt also used to live there.” And a gent added: “It obviously costs money to keep them road legal and the cars are usually taken away at night so they can get a new MOT. “The batteries are down so the AA has to re-start them. “Three of the cars have private plates and he is doing nothing wrong, but the mind boggles as to why. “Sadly there doesn’t seem to be anything we can do about it but it seems they are there to spite someone and is so infantile. “He once put flower pots down his driveway because he thought neighbours were parking there.” Sixty-three-year-old Mr Cumming runs an accountancy firm in Cathcart Street. This week he was unrepentant he was causing the neighbours stress. Asked why the cars had been there for up to 13 years, he replied: “Because that is my home.” When it was put to him that he actually lived in Glenalla Crescent, he said: “That’s my home. Nothing is bizarre. I do live in the house. “Don’t report anything outwith the police report. “I can park cars legally and that is the end of the matter. I have no further comment.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.  Stuart Gibb, area manager of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership (DELAP), said that consultation had already taken place with groups such as DELAP and the town\u0026rsquos community council, as well as various departments of East Lothian Council.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe area partnership is supporting the acknowledgement that the town is getting bigger.  \u0026ldquoFacilities and amenities need to be on the ball in terms of that growth to ensure that we have suitable and sustainable facilities moving forward."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8055467.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scottish-open-the-renaissance-club-to-stage-2019-tournament","story":"  This year\u0027s tournament is due to get under way tomorrow (Thursday) at Gullane Golf Club and, in 12 months\u0027 time,\u0026nbspwill move just three miles along the coast as it is played at the Renaissance Club, at Archerfield.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.

He told the Courier how the drastic change in career came about: \u0026ldquoWhen I was a PT people used to come to me and ask for a diet plan or a training plan.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod say \u0026lsquohave you had one of these before?\u0026rsquo and they\u0026rsquod tell me they\u0026rsquod had seven or eight.

I then went to Thailand on a course and it\u0026rsquos all gone from there.  John, a former Ross High School pupil, initially worked with youth football clubs across the county while trying to make a breakthrough to top-level players. He said: \u0026ldquoI sent messages, filled out contact forms and heard nothing until this time last year, when John [Souttar] got in touch.  \u0026ldquoI think there is a bit of a stigma because it\u0026rsquos psychology and people think you\u0026rsquove got to have a \u0026lsquoproblem\u0026rsquo but it\u0026rsquos not about that.  \u0026ldquoI focus on three things: mindset, the player as a person and their performance. I believe that a better person is a better player so what they do off the pitch is massively important.  And he explained how he worked with players on an individual basis, saying: \u0026ldquoI get to know the players.  \u0026ldquoSomeone could be struggling with self-confidence, or we all know what social media is like \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos where I come in to help them.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.  During the engagement, Prince William watched a short film about the history of the NHS and listened to singing by the NHS Forth Valley Nurses Choir."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064994.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"rugby-stars-take-on-golfers-at-gullane-ahead-of-scottish-open","story":"  Scotland caps Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings faced off against South African Dean Burmester and New Zealander Ryan Fox in a \u0027rugby vs golf\u0027 challenge.\u0026nbsp  Kinghorn and Hastings kicked rugby balls around the championship course, while Fox and Burmester got some practice in earlier this week, with the rugby stars coming out on top 2-1.\u0026nbsp  Below is a video of the challenge. . .\u0026nbsp      Rugby \u0026#127386 Golf    With @LeuchieHouse and @MNDoddie5 as the official charities this week, we decided to have fun with a little #RugbyGolf challenge \u0026#127945\u0026#9971 pic.twitter/eCH0KBEjin  The Scottish Open\u0027s two charity partners this year are the My Name\u00275 Doddie Foundation, set-up by former Scotland rugby star Doddie Weir following his diagnosis with Motor Neurone Disease and Leuchie House, the North Berwick-based national respite charity of which Adam\u0027s dad Gavin Hastings is patron."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8070351.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"all-the-latest-from-day-three-of-the-scottish-open-at-gullane","story":"  He carded a two-under-par 68 in his third round today (Saturday) to lead the tournament at Gullane Golf Club.\u0026nbsp  He\u0026rsquos a shot clear of a six-strong group that includes American Rickie Fowler, the 2015 Scottish Open\u0026nbspchampion at Gullane.

And he indicated the EU was ready to amend its \"backstop\" proposals for the Irish border, which have become the biggest stumbling block in talks.  But the chief negotiator also made clear there were elements of the plan agreed by the Cabinet earlier this month, which the European Commission did not understand, and said further discussions would be needed over the coming weeks to establish how much \"common ground\" exists between London and Brussels.  Mrs May\u0027s proposal for a \"facilitated customs arrangement\" opened up the risk of major fraud, additional bureaucracy and damage to EU businesses, he claimed.  Mr Barnier was speaking shortly after the PM issued a challenge to Brussels to \"evolve\" its negotiating position in response to the publication of her Brexit blueprint.  He said the EU had always been \"creative and flexible\" in its approach to negotiations.  But he insisted that future talks would be based on the guidelines issued by the European Council in March - which included the controversial proposal to keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union - and not on Mrs May\u0027s document.  \"There will be a deal if there is an agreement on the backstop,\" declared Mr Barnier.  \"It\u0027s not necessarily our backstop. We can work on this, amend it, improve our backstop - the one that the Commission proposed on behalf of the Union.  \"Technically we feel that it\u0027s workable, we can improve it further, we can work on it. We are doing that work.  \"But we need an operational backstop now, in the Withdrawal Agreement, and not later.\"  In her first major Brexit speech since the wave of ministerial resignations which followed her Chequers deal, Mrs May described the White Paper proposals as \"a significant development of our position...a coherent package\".  And she said: \"It is now for the EU to respond - not simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable, but to evolve their position in kind.  \"And, on that basis, I look forward to resuming constructive discussions.\"  Speaking in Belfast, the PM also took aim at critics from the hard Brexit wing of the Conservative Party, accusing them of being ready to \"betray\" the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic.  She took on the argument of prominent Eurosceptics including Jacob Rees-Mogg, who say the UK should simply declare it will impose no checks on its side of the Irish border and leave it to Brussels to decide whether to require the Republic to erect barriers on the other.  \"The protection of the peace process and upholding our binding commitments in the Belfast Agreement are grave responsibilities,\" she said.  \"Not to seek a solution would be to resume our career as an independent sovereign trading nation by betraying commitments to a part of our nation and to our nearest neighbour.\"  And she took a swipe at former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson\u0027s claim - repeated in his resignation speech to the Commons on Wednesday - that technological solutions could be used to avoid the need for infrastructure at the border.  \"No technology solution to address these issues has been designed yet or implemented anywhere in the world, let alone in such a unique and highly sensitive context as the Northern Ireland border,\" she said.  Mrs May restated her implacable opposition to the EU backstop, which she said would involve the creation of a customs border within the UK, which was \"something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept\".  Equally, she said that a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic was \"almost inconceivable\".  Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement, the return of any form of physical checkpoints or other infrastructure would be \"an alien concept\".  The PM said that her White Paper proposals, which would see the UK remain within the single market for goods and adopt a \"common rule book\" of regulations with the EU, represented a \"credible third option\" that would \"honour the Belfast Agreement, deliver on the referendum result and be good for our economy\".  In Brussels, Mr Barnier pointed out the Withdrawal Agreement could not be concluded without a legally binding backstop setting out the fall-back arrangements if a wider solution for the Irish border could not be found.  This, he stressed, would be based on the Commission\u0027s proposal but \"not necessarily\" stick precisely to the outline released in March."},{"url":null,"title":"dozens-of-major-scottish-infrastructure-projects-are-delayed-or-over-budget","story":"  Dozens of schools, hospitals, rail upgrades and roads have been subject to spiralling costs and overruns, sometimes racking up millions of pounds more than initially anticipated.  High-profile schemes to suffer setbacks include the \u0026pound1.35bn Queensferry Crossing, the new Aberdeen bypass and Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children.  Meanwhile, the cost of the ongoing Edinburgh to Glasgow rail upgrade has soared by more than \u0026pound100m, the latest estimates show.  Impartial Holyrood researchers found 15 projects went over budget between November 2016 and March this year, while 29 had their estimated completion date pushed back.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the scale of the figures \u0026ldquoseriously calls into question the SNP\u0026rsquos handling of major infrastructure projects.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe already know the SNP government is putting billions of pounds of taxpayers\u0026rsquo money for public projects in the hands of private companies \u0026ndash and these figures show that people in Scotland are not getting value for money.  \u0026ldquoThere needs to be a wholescale review of public procurement in Scotland, including spending on major infrastructure projects.  \u0026ldquoPeople in Scotland deserve better than a policy that lines the pockets of shareholders only to leave important works delayed and over budget.  Research carried out by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe), and commissioned by Labour, compared details for 48 major projects between 2016 and this year.  It found 33 of them saw their estimated budgets rise in that time or had their completion dates pushed back, or both \u0026ndash including 12 schools.  But the real figure may be even higher, as there are more than 80 schemes currently being advanced in which the Scottish Government is involved.  St Joseph\u0027s College in Dumfries cost \u0026pound10m more than expected in 2016, while Boroughmuir High School in Edinburgh had its opening delayed multiple times and now needs a new extension because it can\u0026rsquot cope with booming school rolls.  Motorway improvement works on the M8, M73 and M74 cost \u0026pound13 million more, while a new hospital and healthcare facility on Orkney is currently \u0026pound10m over budget and delayed by five months.  Last year, NHS Lothian confirmed there would be further delays in the opening of the new Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh.  Of the projects examined by SPICe, only one \u0026ndash the A737 Dalry Bypass \u0026ndash saw its estimated cost drop between November 2016 and March this year. Two schools, Kelso High and Dunoon Primary, were completed earlier than expected.  Researchers said some cost increases could be due to a change in the scope of a project.  But Ms Baillie said the fact that financial and timescale details are only available for a limited number of schemes meant the figures \"could just be the tip of the iceberg\".  Ronnie Hunter, the former chairman of the Institution of Civil Engineers in Scotland, said there were a variety of reasons why projects might stumble into difficulties.  This could include bad weather, problems with ground conditions and late variations to a contract. Archaeological finds are also increasingly holding up work.  But Mr Hunter said in most modern contracts, the risk is increasingly borne by the contractor \u0026ndash meaning the public don\u0026rsquot shoulder the cost when things go wrong.  He said contractors are forced to pay \"liquidated damages\" if they run over agreed time frames.  He added: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos no benefit to them of running over. There\u0026rsquos always a cost. It\u0026rsquos not in the contractor\u0026rsquos interests to be late.  \"The public are not paying for it \u0026ndash the public don\u0027t get use of the asset, but they don\u0027t pay for the cost of the overrun or the damages.  \u0026ldquoFor all these contracts that we have got, it\u0026rsquos not straightforward to say it\u0026rsquos a Scottish Government problem. It might be a contractor problem.  But he added: \u0026ldquoIt does seem quite a big number that do run over. That does seem odd.\"  He referenced the Queensferry Crossing, where delays incurred no cost to the public purse.  A Scottish Government spokesman said a number of \"significant projects\" were on course to be delivered this year.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to delivering critical infrastructure projects and have a strong record in this field, including major road improvements to the M8, M73 and M74, the Queensferry Crossing, which came in \u0026pound245m under budget and the new Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.  \u0026ldquoWhile it\u0026rsquos not uncommon to encounter challenges when delivering such a large number of ambitious projects of this size, scale and complexity, we have made excellent progress on our infrastructure plan, with further significant projects set to be completed this year. All of which is good for jobs, our economy and Scotland overall.  It comes amid widespread fears over the quality of construction work being carried out in Scotland.  A panel of experts recently found developers and contractors cannot be fully relied on to assess whether their buildings have been built to a high enough standard."},{"url":null,"title":"eus-michel-barnier-picks-major-holes-in-theresa-mays-brexit-plan","story":"  After Theresa May urged Brussels to \u0026ldquoevolve its thinking and stop coming up with unworkable proposals, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator underscored the fundamental obstacles to a Brexit deal with just 13 weeks of negotiating time to go.  Speaking after briefing ministers from the EU27 in Brussels, Mr Barnier opened his remarks by saying how the UK\u0026rsquos White Paper had created a way for \"constructive discussions\" on the post-Brexit relationship between Britain and the EU.  And he indicated Brussels was ready to amend its \"backstop\" proposals for the Irish border, which have become the biggest stumbling block in the talks.  But for most of his press conference the chief negotiator, without completely dismissing the Chequers Plan altogether, raised serious questions about key elements of it:  *noting how it only included alignment for goods checked at the border, he pointed out how rules on areas like pesticide used in the agri-food sector were not included. \u0026ldquoHow can we protect consumers in Europe?\" he asked.  *pointing to the plan to collect differing tariffs under the UK Government\u0026rsquos facilitated customs arrangement, he asked: \"How can custom services verify the final destination of goods so that they apply the right tariff is there not a major risk of fraud?  *given the UK wants divergence on services \u0026ndash 80 per cent of its economy \u0026ndash how would the EU avoid \"unfair competition?\".  Mr Barnier declared: \"Our main aim is to protect the EU\u0027s single market to protect what we are.  Responding to the EU chief negotiator\u0026rsquos remarks, Labour\u0026rsquos Owen Smith, on behalf of the pro-EU Open Britain, said: \u0026ldquoMrs May\u0026rsquos July of horrors just got a lot worse as Mr Barnier made it clear her White Paper was a dead letter.  Tom Brake for the Liberal Democrats claimed Mr Barnier had systematically torn apart the PM\u0027s White Paper and that the prospect of a \"catastrophic no-deal Brexit is becoming more concrete by the day\".  Earlier in Belfast, the Prime Minister insisted her compromise plan offered a \u0026ldquocoherent strategy and a \u0026ldquopractical working solution to delivering on the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU.  She made clear any UK Government could \u0026ldquonever accept that the way to prevent a hard border with Ireland is to create a new border within the United Kingdom to do so would also be a breach of the spirit of the Belfast Agreement, insisted Mrs May.  In Edinburgh, Jeremy Hunt diverged from his Cabinet colleague Andrea Leadsom, the Commons Leader, who made clear that the Chequers Plan was the UK\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquofinal offer and that if it were not accepted by Brussels, then there would be no deal.  The new Foreign Secretary described Britain\u0026rsquos White Paper as a \u0026ldquosubstantive offer, adding: \u0026ldquoIt should be the basis upon which a deal can be done. But it\u0026rsquos going to need imagination and flexibility to make sure that we continue to make progress.  Meanwhile, No 10 brushed aside the claim from Leo Varadkar that British aircraft would be barred from his country\u0027s airspace and \u0026ldquowould not fly in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  A Downing Street spokeswoman insisted the Irish Taoiseach was \u0026ldquowrong, pointing out how so-called \"overflight rights\" were guaranteed by international treaties rather than EU membership.  Commenting on the day\u0026rsquos developments, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Council, tweeted: \u0026ldquoToday\u0027s aggressive comments by Messrs Varadkar and Barnier show why we are right to be leaving the mafia-like European Union.\""},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-michel-barnier-politely-but-forensically-picks-holes-in-theresa-mays-chequers-plan","story":"  The press conference began relatively well as the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator highlighted how 80 per cent of the deal with Britain had been done and that the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Chequers Plan had opened up the way to \u0026ldquoconstructive talks.  On that very fraught issue of the Irish border there were more positive-sounding words with Mr Barnier making clear what he was after might not turn out to be the EU\u0026rsquos offer but just a \u0026ldquoworkable plan.  He insisted the EU27 had no intention of creating a border down the Irish Sea \u0026ndash the reddest of Mrs May\u0026rsquos red lines \u0026ndash and stressed: \u0026ldquoWe can work on this, amend it, improve our backstop.  But after the positivity came the negativity and the chief negotiator\u0026rsquos catalogue of concerns from how the proposed reciprocity of tariff-collecting could lead to fraud and increased bureaucracy to how the alignment of rules on goods did not cover everything and so could endanger EU consumers.  There was also the little matter of how while the UK wanted divergence on goods, it did not want the same on services, which covered 80 per cent of its economy. Mr Barnier pulled out his mobile phone to illustrate how much of what this particular good contained was services.  If the Irish backstop is the fundamental element that could scupper the whole deal, then his promised flexibility on the issue might be a ray of sunshine that appears from behind a large dark cloud.  His key sentence was: \u0026ldquoThere will be a deal if there is an agreement on the backstop.\"  Indeed, the f-word was used by Jeremy Hunt, the new Foreign Secretary, who detracted from the take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum offered by his Cabinet colleague, Andrea Leadsom she had insisted the Chequers Plan was Britain\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquofinal offer, rejection would mean no deal.  Mr Hunt told reporters in Edinburgh Mrs May\u0026rsquos compromise was the \u0026ldquobasis upon which a deal can be done but added it was going to \u0026ldquoneed imagination and flexibility to make progress.  This weekend as Dominic Raab, the new Brexit Secretary, takes to the airwaves to emphasise his desire to \u0026ldquointensify the talks with Brussels, time is beginning to zip by - and with it the chances of getting a deal."},{"url":null,"title":"julian-smith-and-brandon-lewis-join-theresa-may-in-a-would-i-lie-to-you-special","story":"  The opposing team is conspicuous by its absence but there should be plenty here from Team May.

She\u0026rsquos determined to win \u0026ndash even if the losers are the British public.  She\u0026rsquoll be playing against her own side, but can her teammates convince her they\u0026rsquore playing it straight? Or only playing fast and loose?

Ms McVey, now Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, has said the Universal Credit system will create \u0026ldquoan agile service. As agile as her ability to present alternative truths.  Julian Smith, Chief Whip, joining them. Mr Smith seems to have no concerns about lying to a colleague who\u0026rsquos on maternity leave \u0026ndash so why the pregnant pause before Mrs May does the right thing and sacks him?  Brandon Lewis MP. You might have been trying to help, Mr Lewis, but you\u0026rsquove left your captain holding the baby.  And Andrea Leadsom. John Bercow has asked us to clarify that his words were \u0026ldquoa far from stupid woman. Mrs Leadsom\u0026rsquos new complaints scheme for MPs and peers grants anonymity to honourable members being investigated for wrongdoing, including harassment and expenses fraud.  Voting for legislation to cover up their own misdoings: what a beautiful demonstration of the current contempt politicians hold for their citizens.  Now for the Quick-Fire Lies round.  Ms McVey wilfully misled Parliament by insisting a highly critical National Audit Office report said there were no problems with the implementation of the Universal Credit system. Demonstrating agility, she has now admitted there are continuing problems.  \u0026ldquoWhere we need to put our hands up, she said, \u0026ldquoWe will do.  Mr Smith and Mr Lewis have insisted they broke the \u0026ldquopairing arrangement on a knife-edge Brexit customs union vote on Tuesday, which the Government won by six votes, in \u0026ldquoerror.  Mrs May said the agreement was broken in an \u0026ldquohonest mistake. Would the Prime Minister clarify \u0026ldquomistake, given she once said leaving the EU would be a mistake but now is Brexit champion?  To the Homes Truths round.  The foreign secretary tried to draw the limelight to himself during a constitutional crisis, even when a British citizen had been killed on home soil by an apparently foreign nerve agent.  A cabinet minister has deliberately given false information to parliament but escaped with barely a slapped wrist when the victims of her sustained bungling would have had their benefits sanctioned.  Two politicians have cheated a system of parliamentary fairness yet days later are still in post with the PM obfuscating about their actions.  While the Government is rapidly losing any respect from or credibility with the people it serves, MPs have voted to give themselves anonymity when investigated for wrongdoing.  This lackadaisical approach towards the truth, towards fairness and towards respect for its citizenry comes from a Government in need, more than ever, of facing up to inconvenient truths.

But according to reports the party may be taking place in the Caribbean, as William and Kate are rumoured to have taken their children on a summer break to the exclusive island of Mustique.  George has made a number of eventful public appearances over the past 12 months, from starting school to a cheeky moment on Buckingham Palace\u0026rsquos balcony, as the royal family celebrated the Queen\u0026rsquos official birthday.  But he can sometimes appear a little shy and reluctant in front of the cameras \u0026ndash understandable for a young boy who is slowly getting to grips with life in the limelight.  Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge was born at the private maternity unit of St Mary\u0026rsquos Hospital, Paddington, the Lindo Wing, at 4.24pm on July 22, 2013, weighing 8lbs 6oz.  He made his public debut in front of the world\u0026rsquos media on the hospital steps one day later, wrapped in a white merino wool shawl, cradled in his proud parents\u0026rsquo arms.  A great-grandchild to the Queen, he will be the 43rd monarch since William the Conqueror obtained the crown of England if, as expected, his reign follows those of the Prince of Wales, then William.  A few months after his last birthday George started his first day at school with his father, but without his mother, Kate. She was experiencing severe morning sickness as she was pregnant with Prince Louis.  The duke managed his parenting duties alone and said later: \u0026ldquoIt went well. There was one other parent who had more of an issue with their children \u0026ndash so I was quite pleased I wasn\u0026rsquot the one.  The youngster has just completed his first year at school, attending Thomas\u0026rsquos Battersea in south London.  He even played a sheep in his school\u0026rsquos Christmas nativity play, and loves helicopters, flying and is obsessed with all things police-related.  When baby brother Louis was born he joined younger sister Princess Charlotte outside the Lindo Wing in April as they visited their new brother with their father.  In June George and his family joined the Queen and other royals on Buckingham Palace\u0026rsquos balcony as the monarch\u0026rsquos official birthday celebrations drew to a close with the traditional fly-past.  But the young prince was seen playing up with seven-year-old Savannah, the daughter of Peter and Autumn Phillips, who jokingly put her hand over his mouth.  George was last seen at the christening of his baby brother Louis at the Chapel Royal at St James\u0026rsquos Palace on July 9, and in official photos marking the royal baptism."},{"url":null,"title":"denis-thatcher-queried-paul-mccartneys-inclusion-on-showbiz-reception-guestlist","story":"  The reception in April 1988, to be attended by Thatcher and her husband, was planned as a thank you to the 45 celebrities who attended the Wembley Rally during her 1987 General Election campaign.  Thatcher decided more guests were needed and a longer list of \u0026ldquoa possible 229 without spouses was drawn up \u0026ndash including some suggestions from former culture secretary John Whittingdale, then political secretary to Thatcher.  \u0026ldquoHe was not then the grizzled elder statesman of the present day, said Chris Collins, of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation. \u0026ldquoThis was the young man whose evenings were spent watching Meat Loaf at the Hammersmith Odeon.  \u0026ldquoHis idea of a good party was to invite Paul McCartney, Freddie Mercury, the Jaggers.  However, Denis Thatcher went through the proposed guestlist with a red pen, marking ticks against those he \u0026ldquowould personally like to see included and question marks beside \u0026ldquothose who, I believe, do not help.  In a note to the Private Office, he wrote: \u0026ldquoWhilst I accept of course that not everyone who comes to our receptions are necessarily on \u0026lsquoour\u0026rsquo side I find it both unpleasant and embarrassing to entertain those who publicly insult the PM.  \u0026ldquoThis list therefore needs some careful checking in this regard.  He explained that more than one red tick \u0026ldquomeans super person and a known friend and wonderful to have them here.  His absolute favourite was comedian Eric Sykes, who got four ticks.  There were also ticks for Rolf Harris, Andrew Lloyd-Webber, Dame Judi Dench, Ronnie Corbett and golfers Tony Jacklin and Nick Faldo, among others.  Question marks were placed beside names including Paul McCartney, Sir David Attenborough, Sebastian Coe, Shirley Bassey and magician Paul Daniels.  Mr Collins said it was \u0026ldquounusual for Denis Thatcher to involve himself to such lengths, and that this may be explained by an earlier episode in which Thatcher considered suing BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme for libel over a show aired in January 1988.  Denis Thatcher criticised the show\u0026rsquos satirical story, entitled Thatcherism: The Final Solution, writing that never has \u0026ldquoso foul a libel been published against anyone let alone a Prime Minister.  Mr Collins said: \u0026ldquoThe special coded system of question marks and ticks and crosses, that\u0026rsquos actually slightly unusual.  \u0026ldquoI think perhaps he was in a somewhat irritable frame of mind and maybe the story about the BBC helps to explain that.  \u0026ldquoCertainly the steam is coming out of his ears at various points in 1988 and this party he jumps on.  In the end the longer guestlist was dropped in favour of the original 45 plus the Parliamentary Skiing Team and the British Winter Olympics Squad.  Eddie \u0026ldquothe Eagle Edwards, who competed in the ski jump at the Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada, in February 1988, does not appear on the list.  He said he was invited to the reception but could not attend due to a clash with a charity event.  Mr Collins said documents do not reveal why \u0026ldquosuddenly they changed tack from plans for the longer guestlist.

One MP said the penalties the EC was currently able to hand out were \u0026ldquolaughable and viewed \u0026ldquosimply as the cost of doing business.  The group suggested police should be given powers to investigate breaches of electoral law that should be punishable with unlimited fines.  A number of revelations in recent months have seen action being taken against members of the official Brexit campaign, Vote Leave, and pro-Leave groups Leave.EU and BeLeave.  However, the size and nature of the sanctions meted out have raised questions about the strength of rules in place to protect democracy, the MPs said.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos clearer now than ever before that our electoral system is not fit for purpose and in dire need of reform, the group said.  Their concerns were laid out in a letter to Commons speaker John Bercow, who chairs the Speaker\u0026rsquos Committee on the Electoral Commission.  The signatories, who include Labour and Lib Dem MPs, along with Green MP Caroline Lucas, recommended four reforms to help prevent electoral abuse. They are:  1. Hand the EC\u0026rsquos powers of investigation and prosecution to police and remove limits to fines.  2. Require campaigns to report expenditure online in a similar way to MPs\u0026rsquo expenses.  3. Prohibit transfers from a designated campaign to satellite campaigns.  4. Regulate, or possibly pause, paid political advertising during an election period.  Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP who organised the letter, said British democracy was \u0026ldquounder attack by a mixture of foreign influence and abuses of our laws.  \u0026ldquoThe Government must act immediately otherwise abuse will continue and trust will decline \u0026ndash more dark money and dark data will flood the system and buy influence, he said.  The MP for Aberavon said the EC was an \u0026ldquoanalogue regulator in a digital age that was in \u0026ldquodesperate need of reform, adding: \u0026ldquo(Its) fines are laughable and seen simply as the cost of doing business.  In June, the EC said \u0026ldquourgent action was needed by the UK\u0026rsquos governments and parliaments, along with social media companies, to improve transparency around how voters are targeted online.  Earlier this week, Vote Leave was fined \u0026pound61,000 and was accused of failing to declare money it spent with controversial data firm Aggregate IQ.  The EC said an investigation found \u0026ldquosignificant evidence of joint working between Vote Leave and youth Brexit group BeLeave, which was founded by student Darren Grimes.  Mr Grimes was fined \u0026pound20,000 and referred to the politan Police along with David Halsall, the responsible person for Vote Leave, \u0026ldquoin relation to false declarations of campaign spending.  The action came after Leave.EU was fined a record-equalling \u0026pound70,000 and its chief executive Liz Bilney referred to police in May over its spending.  Vote Leave said the Electoral Commission\u0026rsquos report contained \u0026ldquoa number of false accusations and incorrect assertions that are wholly inaccurate and do not stand up to scrutiny.  Mr Grimes said the fine was \u0026ldquoentirely disproportionate and unjustified and he \u0026ldquodid nothing wrong."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-heading-for-no-deal-brexit-says-jacob-rees-mogg","story":"  The prominent Tory MP insisted that leaving on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms was now likely.  Presenting a phone-in on LBC, Mr Rees-Mogg said: \u0026ldquoI think we are heading to WTO and I think WTO is nothing to be frightened of.  But he said talks should continue with Brussels, stating: \u0026ldquoI think we should carry on negotiating until the end.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think we necessarily need the theatrics of walking away, but the truth is that WTO is likely to be all that they will offer us.  The comments came as Theresa May was digging in on her Brexit deal offer to Brussels after the EU publicly doubted the controversial proposals were workable.  Government sources insisted the Prime Minister was \u0026ldquostanding over the Chequers Cabinet compromise on withdrawal plans despite a mauling of the initiative by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.  Mr Barnier openly questioned the credibility of the UK\u0026rsquos proposals in his first response to the Government\u0026rsquos white paper on Brexit.  And in comments that will likely alarm arch-Brexiteers in Tory ranks, the vice president of the European Parliament, and MEP for Ireland\u0026rsquos governing Fine Gael party, Mairead McGuinness, made it clear that Mrs May would need to abandon some of her red lines to clinch a deal.  Speaking to the BBC, she said of London\u0026rsquos proposals: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a starting point, it\u0026rsquos not an end deal.          \u0026ldquoAs we go through the details, we will not be able to accept everything that\u0026rsquos in there \u0026ndash Vice-President of the European Parliament @MaireadMcGMEP on Theresa May\u0026rsquos Chequers deal pic.twitter/oBAApFAKMe          \u0026mdash BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight) July 20, 2018  \u0026ldquoI think the British Prime Minister set out red lines too early on and too deeply.  \u0026ldquoWe are prepared to show flexibility if the British Prime Minister can show flexibility.  Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood insisted the white paper was a workable compromise.  He told the BBC: \u0026ldquoThere is no yes/yes solution here which will balance out the extreme views of the Brexiteers and the extreme views of the Remainers.  \u0026ldquoIt is therefore essential that we have compromise.  \u0026ldquoAnd this is exactly what the white paper does.  \u0026ldquoIt means that we have for the Remainers, we have access to goods and services, a deal with Europe as well.  \u0026ldquoWe have financial markets as well.  \u0026ldquoAnd on the Leave campaign side of things, the bill, the EU bill stops. We leave the customs union, we leave the agricultural policy, we leave the common fisheries policy, and, of course, we are able to strike our own deals.  The comments came after Mr Barnier expressed concern that Mrs May\u0026rsquos proposal for a \u0026ldquofacilitated customs arrangement opened up the risk of major fraud, additional bureaucracy and damage to EU businesses.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Vet finds Major mess on record paddle run","story":"A VET caused a bit of a splash when she swapped her stethoscope for a paddleboard to complete a memorable Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats journey.Cal Major was paddling along the seas, rivers and canals of Britain in order to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our waters and to also raise money for mental health charities the Samaritans and Vetlife.The 30-year-old completed her momentous journey inside 59 days \u0026ndash as she\u0026rsquos the first to do this by paddleboard, she is now the official world-record holder.Cal, who hails from North Devon, is keen to highlight not only the untidiness of plastic litter left on our beaches and in our seas but also the damage it can do to both the sea wildlife and the environment.She found many examples of plastic pollution along the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats and hopes people will give more though to their use and disposal of plastic products.\u0026ldquoThere was plastic wherever I went. I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected. One morning in Wigan I counted 691 plastic bottles just in the first hour of paddling.Cal admitted that the marathon paddle was not without a scary moment or two.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Mull of Galloway paddle was one of the more terrifying moments. Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful. When I was 12 miles across, the waves were almost as big as me and the storm came in early. I was very scared and felt very alone \u0026ndash panic was starting to set in.\u0026ldquoOnce I was within a mile of the island, and knew I was safe, fear turned to exhilaration, and the feeling of being propelled along by 20-30 knot winds was incredible.Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Wick River green slime passed safe for canines","story":"THE Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has allayed fears that an algae that has appeared on the surface of Wick River is harmful.Dog walkers in Wick had voiced concerns about the \u0026ldquogreen slime following the poisoning death of a dog by blue-green algae in the River Conon in Ross-shire last week.A spokesman from Sepa said that officers had confirmed the presence of enteromorpha in Wick River.\u0026ldquoEnteromorpha is a type of green algae\u0026nbspwhich, unlike blue-green algae, is not harmful.

This means 42 per cent of all eligible LFASS 2017 claims have now been paid, with more payments to follow in the coming weeks.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Given the pressures that farmers and crofters continue to face, due in part to the extreme weather conditions during the winter and summer periods, I’m glad to see these important payments starting two months earlier than last year.“Earlier in the year we provided a loan option for farmers in advance of these payments, to help provide cashflow and financial certainty. Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting them wherever possible.\u0026#8221On behalf of the Scottish Farmers Union, NFU Scotland, LFA Committee Chairman, Robert Macdonald, welcomed the news saying: “The news that LFASS payments will be reaching farmers and crofters is welcome, particularly for those who did not apply for or receive an LFASS loan of 90 per cent through the LFASS loan scheme. The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues. NFU Scotland continues to press the Scottish Government for a timetable for payments, delivered in a timely manner to allow farmers and crofters to efficiently plan their cashflow.“Whilst these payments will bring relief for some, NFUS continues to highlight to farmers and crofters the importance of planning ahead for straw and feed supplies with three key messages — Plan ahead, Be flexible and collaborate.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions. As a result, the society decided to develop its own system that could be adopted across its growing portfolio of homes.Matt Stevenson of Carbon Dynamic said of FitHomes: \"I truly believe that this housing method can change the way that we view construction of new housing developments as well as feeding into the wider healthcare and societal issues.\"Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known. He is an example to us all.\"Mike is a great colleague but more importantly a great friend to all of us in the Highlands.\"Since their launch of the Utility Week Stars Awards in 2014, the annual event has grown to become the de facto celebration of dedication, ingenuity and teamwork in the UK utilities sector.SSEN picked up another gong, as the SSEN Safety, Health and Environment team won the Health and Safety Initiative award for the roll-out of an influencing behaviours training programme and safety licence across the division.Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaSaturday 21 Jul 2018 9:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre (OGTC) is leading the industry-backed “Facility of the Future” initiative that could halve the cost of developing and operating an oil and gas facility and help to access the equivalent of more than 3.5 billion barrels of reserves in so-called marginal discoveries.            A discovery is classed as marginal when the risks or technology involved make it too challenging to develop economically, for instance because of its geographical location or the specialist equipment needed.            The project wants to design a new approach that will make this process more efficient than traditional methods, such as fixed platforms.It aims to develop lower-cost, reusable facilities that can be remotely operated from onshore control centres, thereby increasing reducing the requirement for staff to work in the hazardous offshore environment and creating skilled onshore jobs. Chris Pearson, the OGTC’s small pools solution centre manager, said: “Oil and gas is playing catch-up with many industries when it comes to automation and remote operations. We’re exploring how the combination of existing and new technology can be best used in the offshore environment to improve safety, reduce life cycle cost and increase efficiency.“New, smarter and more automated ways of developing oil and gas fields are required if we’re to fully unlock marginal discoveries and maximise economic recovery from the UKCS. “The Facility of the Future initiative will help to significantly reduce life-cycle costs and strengthen the investment case for both marginal discoveries and more traditional reservoirs.”            The initiative will kick off with a study led by Crondall Energy and Buoyant Production Technologies to develop a floating facility adapted from the type of installations currently used for shallow water gas fields, known as NUIs, to make them suitable for oil discoveries. It hopes to design an NUI concept that will function at any water depth and uses a minimal manning approach by involving remote control and automation technologies.Niki Chambers, project manager at the marginal development solutions centre, said: “This study is looking at unlocking the capabilities of these floating facilities to work across any kind of discovery. It is opening up the whole of the UKCS.” The OGTC is supported by the Scottish and UK governments, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire councils and Opportunity North East. It also generates funding from industry and university partners, and is currently in the process of securing further funds for subsequent studies as part of this initiative."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770822.1531988489!/image/image.jpg","title":"business stream looking to make waves with sales and marketing director","story":"        Water supplier Business Stream has hired a sales and marketing director from a rival business.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4771968.1532111485!/image/image.jpg","title":"jane bradley the sad end of this sporting life","story":"        Top athletes and sportspeople can find it difficult to come to terms with the end of their career, writes Jane Bradley.                It is Saturday morning. All over the country, right as you’re reading this, thousands of young people will be practising sport.            You may be a parent, grandparent or friend of one of the dedicated young sportsmen or women. You might have picked this up to help while away the time waiting for them in a leisure centre in Edinburgh, or Stirling, or Thurso - while your offspring completes lengths of the pool, swings in circles from a pair of gymnastics rings, or practices their double-handed backhand. You might be waiting by an ice rink in Dundee, watching sit spins and spirals or at the side of a rugby pitch in Melrose while your son or daughter launches themselves into a ruck.            While some of these young people are doing all of this entirely for fun or fitness,  others will harbour dreams of a sporting career. A proportion of those will dedicate their childhood and teenage years to trying to get to the top of their profession, while an even smaller number will actually make it to competing at a high level. For the ones who do make it to the Olympic Games, it is all too easy to assume they have made it, reached their final goal.Yet a first-person account from a retiring athlete made me think hard this week about the difficulties of what happens next. Most sports people – with some exceptions, showjumper John Whitaker is still contemplating the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, when he will be 64 – reach the pinnacle of their careers by their early 30s. The question is, then what?In a week when retired sprinter Usain Bolt looks set to sign for an Australian football club, Edinburgh-based Team GB Olympic swimmer Lizzie Simmonds published a blog post about retiring from competitive swimming aged 27.READ MORE: Justin Gatlin gatecrashes Usain Bolt’s farewell partyIn a piece called “How to be a real person”, Simmonds – who hit the headlines earlier this year after tweeting about an exchange with a woman in a swimming pool in the capital who had told her that she was so good she should consider joining a club team – writes of the struggles of moving from a regimented and focused daily life into the real world.            “Lots of athletes get into trouble when they leave elite sport, and it’s not too difficult to understand why. After being identified as ‘Lizzie the swimmer’ for so long, I’ve just morphed into ‘Lizzie the normal person’,” she wrote.“If, like me, an athlete has often defined themselves by their successes in sport, then it can be difficult to surrender their hard-won identity in the search for a new one.”She has a point. We see them, standing there on the podium, medals around their necks and assume that they have it made. Yet managing to merely financially survive in competitive sport is a feat in itself – for many without lucrative endorsement and sponsorship deals, there is little room for financial planning for the future.Athlete Jesse Owens, who scooped four golds at the 1936 Olympics, famously defended his decision to move into racehorse training for the money after retiring from running, saying: “I had four gold medals, but you can’t eat four gold medals.”            In addition, the psychological impact of carving out a life doing the thing that you love – and the only job you have known – then finding it has come to an end cannot be easy and sport as an industry is beginning to realise that. Sport Scotland employs dedicated ‘performance lifestyle advisers’ to help athletes through transitions, while Abertay University in Dundee two years ago appointed the world’s first ever professor of duty of care in sport.READ MORE: Olympic heroes, no 3: Jesse OwensThere are, of course, those who can keep on competing. Golfers, particularly, have access to a lucrative Masters tour, through which many can earn a decent amount of cash up to retirement age. But for long jumpers or javelin throwers, the spectator dollar is not likely to be as forthcoming.Some retired athletes manage to move on to teaching, training or reporting. They are elite athletes, with decades of experience in a very specific field. Yet, even for those who are able to remain within the sector in some way, life is never quite the same. While coaching – or joining sports-related organisations, or becoming commentators or pundits – might mean a chance to keep on wearing the trainers, kicking the ball, wearing the skates or at least talking the talk, it is simply not the same as actually taking part. Which is why many former athletes move into something else entirely.            Back in the days when rugby was non-professional – this only changed fully in 1995 – players would have kept “normal” jobs the whole time, which they could easily step back into after their sporting career came to an end. Many were dentists, lawyers or, like Scottish rugby player John Jeffrey, a farmer.In other sports, George Foreman is probably almost better known now for his cooking grill than his boxing success, while British hockey player Crista Cullen, who came out of retirement to take part in the Rio games in 2016 after winning gold in London 2012, now works in conservation in Kenya.My sympathy is with Simmonds as she transforms into a “normal person”.

In a time of Brexit, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, austerity and an economy that seems eternally peely-wally, it feels like a long time since Scotland had some really good news, something to celebrate.            But finally, we do, with the numbers of tourists flocking to Scotland last year almost appearing to be too good to be true.            There were a staggering 3.2 million overseas visitors to Scotland last year, setting a new all-time record. Just think about that figure – it’s the equivalent of almost 60 per cent of the Scottish population.And they spent a record £2.3 billion, up by 23 per cent on the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics, helping to sustain an industry that employs more than 200,000 people.The popularity of the TV series Outlander is said to be one reason why as people flock to see the castles and glens where the Jacobites and Hanoverians once fought to the death. But some might suggest a 17 per cent rise in the number of European tourists could be something to do with Scotland’s strong support for Remain in the EU referendum, particularly when the overall figure for the UK remained about the same.READ MORE: Donald Anderson: How a tourist tax would help Edinburgh stay great            However, while all this is good news for the economy, large numbers of people do bring some challenges. Congestion can be just as big a problem in popular rural areas during the summer as it is in the cities, perhaps even more so given it’s less expected.So the Scottish Government and local councils need to work hard to make sure tourist hotspots are able to cope with the extra influx of people. For example, if our transport network becomes overloaded, those tourists may decide to go elsewhere and local frustrations may grow. And more work could be done to encourage visitors to travel to less well-kent but equally beautiful parts of the country, which would benefit their local economies and take some of the pressure on the busiest places.And tourism isn’t only good business for hotels, restaurants and the like. It is also a key part of Scotland’s image on the world stage. A holidaymaker who has a lovely time visiting Edinburgh Castle, wild-swimming in Loch Ness and getting a selfie with the Harry Potter bridge – sorry, the Glenfinnan Viaduct – in the background might decide Scotland would make a great place to live, to be a student or to start a new business.READ MORE: Alexander McCall Smith: Save Edinburgh from tourism boom"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772007.1532114342!/image/image.jpg","title":"stay informed top 10 opinions of the week","story":"        The Scotsman is publishing a selection of its best opinion articles from the previous seven days to showcase some of the most insightful writing in Scottish journalism.                Ruth Davidson’s barnstorming attack on Donald Trump created headlines in other newspapers after she accused the US President of “desperate – and dangerous – sycophancy” towards Vladimir Putin.            “Nothing attracted a wannabe strong man, it seems, than thuggish strength,” she wrote, adding that Putin’s regime was “contemptuous of international law and our democratic way of life”.             But she said Trump would not bring about the end of Western democracy as we know it because those fighting to preserve our hard-earned freedoms would ultimately prevail.READ MORE: Ruth Davidson: Putin-sycophant Trump will never destroy Western democracyLesley Riddoch also had a thing or two to say about Trump, saying reports that he “totally hates” First Minister Nicola Sturgeon were essentially a feather in her cap.“Whether the head of state is North Korea’s Kim Jong Un or Germany’s Angela Merkel, [Trump] flatters and insults by turn, aiming to destabilise rivals in the run-up to important trade talks. But hate? That’s an emotion largely reserved for his own former members of staff ... and now it seems the First Minister. That’s no mean feat.”By taking part in Scotland’s largest gay pride march in Glasgow during Trump’s visit, Sturgeon delivered an “indirect rebuke” to the US president as this allowed her to “contrast a society which ‘champions equality and fairness at all times’ with Trump’s America where transgender people are banned from the US military and LGBTI content has been removed from US government websites, including an apology to gay people persecuted in the 1950s and 60s”.

The need for unlikely alliances in these strange times was the theme of Joyce McMillan’s column.\u2028“We are ... in a situation where those who want to combat the rising tide of racism, xenophobia, institutional collapse and jingoistic brutalism across the West now have to shape up, pick their side, and put an end to pointless disputes about who, among the opponents of Trump, Brexit and all that they bring in their wake, has the best claim to perfect political virtue. “Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows,” says Shakespeare in The Tempest and all our futures may depend on our ability to see that new times also demand new alliances, and a willingness to stop being distracted from the main task by increasingly irrelevant arguments,” she wrote.READ MORE: Joyce McMillan: New political alliances vital to stop Brexit disasterDarren McGarvey, The Scotsman’s Orwell Prize-winning columnist, had an unusual take on the US President, warning that we all have an “inner Trump”.             “For me, Trump is a mirror, a mirror in which I see clearly the kind of man I am capable of being should I become unvigilant in the face of my glaring absurdities,” he wrote.And, with the searing honesty for which he has become well known, he added: “Drunk and sober, I’ve behaved poorly. I’ve lied to people to preserve a false self-image. I’ve mistreated those I love, whether family, friends or partners in relationships. I’ve engaged in ‘locker-room banter’ and co-signed misogynistic and racist ‘jokes’. For me to get up on stage and pretend I’m some paragon of virtue would be to engage in the very hubristic nonsense for which ‘The Donald’ is infamous.“I did all those things, without a modicum of self-awareness, because the ego I constructed to fortify my demoralising insecurities was so huge that when it came time to hear a bit of sobering truth, I was ill-equipped to take incoming calls. I wonder how many people, at these rallies across the country, are pondering similarly uncomfortable truths about themselves?”READ MORE: Darren McGarvey: Beware your inner Trump, the monster inside us allJohn McLellan, a Conservative councillor and former Scotsman editor, pulled no punches as he tore into fellow Tory Ross Thomson on the issue of our times, Brexit. The Aberdeen South MP had attacked Theresa May’s Brexit plan, claiming it would turn the UK into a “vassal state”, and praised Boris Johnson and David Davis for “standing by their principles” and resigning from the Cabinet.             McLellan suggested this appeared to be “a pitch to be Scotland Secretary in PM Bojo’s Barmy Cabinet”. He pointed to a different take on Johnson’s character by Max Hastings, the ex-editor of the Daily , who wrote that it was a “common mistake to suppose Johnson a nice man ... he is a man of remarkable gifts, flawed by an absence of conscience, principle or scruple”.“The aim for Team May, if I may be so bold, should be to get Brexit over the line, and the word from people a lot closer to this than me beyond the Conservative Party is that the key principles laid out in the Chequers blueprint, like customs alignment for manufactured goods and the end of free movement, are very close to doing just that.”READ MORE: John McLellan: Bojo’s Barmy Army is polishing a t**dBrian Monteith, however, took a rather different stance. The public were being “taken for fools by the Prime Minister”, he wrote. \u2028“There are only two viable positions for our country, or indeed any country: being fully in the European Union or being fully out. Anything else is a self-deceiving construct that in time brings servitude to what the EU wants,” he argued.“May has failed to make Brexit mean Brexit.

Susan Dalgety, on an epic clockwise trip around the entire mainland United States, arrived in New Orleans, a city that has an unusual attitude towards death. The Museum of Death warns visitors to prepare themselves as there have been a number of what it calls “falling down ovations” – people fainting. After recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, the city has returned to being a place famed for its non-stop party atmosphere. “At four in the afternoon, the party was in full swing. James, squeezed into a silver, sequinned jacket three sizes too small, was drinking Bud from a champagne flute, while handing out stuffed toys from a large bag under his seat. ‘He always does that, he’s got a big heart,’ explained Cordell, who came back from the bathroom with a penguin,” wrote Dalgety in the latest instalment of what is a wonderful series of reports.READ MORE: Susan Dalgety: The party city where only musicians keep timeAdmitting this might be seen as “heresy” by some, Kenny MacAskill, Scotland’s former Justice Secretary, called for fellow Nationalists to push for a second Brexit referendum, which he was confident would be won by the Remain camp, before another one on independence.“The political circumstances of Brexit aren’t good for the independence cause and most certainly not a hard Brexit ... An implosion of the economy and collapse in living standards aren’t the best circumstances for a confident people to vote for independence. Suggestions that Scots will see no alternative to leaving the UK are offset by worries that when things are grim they ‘hold on to nurse for fear of something worse’. I’ve never believed that the worse it gets the more folk are likely to vote for independence. No! Sorry, the worse it gets, heads go down and hope fades!” he argued.READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Nationalists must push for Brexitref 2 before Indyref 2Bill Jamieson had a fairly scary warning for the BBC – that it could cease to exist as we know it within five to ten years. The rise of Netflix, Amazon Prime and other global giants of entertainment posed an existential threat to Aunty Beeb, he claimed, while bemoaning the number of repeats.“The BBC’s ... authority has all but gone. Broadcast rivals are no longer reliant on advertising for their income but can raise massive amounts by subscription. The BBC and its £150.50-a-year license fee system has wilted under the assault. It still has the capacity to create stunning and opinion-changing programmes such as Blue Planet, and mount great documentaries and prize-winning historical drama. But why are viewers deserting in their millions? Netflix is capable of mounting first-class drama such as The Crown and House of Cards. Check into a hotel and the likelihood is your room TV will default to Sky News,” he wrote.

People drop names with charming regularity in the Mississippi Delta.            The bluesman who entertained us over breakfast in Clarksdale, birthplace of the blues, is friends with John Lennon’s sister.            “I got a lovely note from Paul McCartney congratulating me on my album of Beatles’ songs, he loved our version of Lady Madonna,” he smiled, before sliding into another three-minute classic.“I drive Carla Thomas a lot,” said Rufus (no relation), our cheerful cab driver in Memphis, “and if you’re around on Sunday, go down to Al Green’s church, he is still singing as well as preachin’.”Al Green, the man whose soulful voice has spread love and happiness across the world, is clearly very popular. “I spent five hours with Reverend Green yesterday,” said Gordon, the man we bumped into in BB King’s club on Beale Street.“And I was with Zelma earlier this week, talkin’ about her music academy. That’s Zelma Redding,” he added quickly, just in case we hadn’t worked out she was the widow of the legendary Otis Redding.There is music in the air in this sultry corner of the United States.            It was here, in the cotton fields of the south, that African American sharecroppers sang ancient rhythms in the blistering heat to ease their breaking souls, while their poor, white neighbours plucked country tunes on cheap guitars.It was in Clarksdale where one Robert Johnson, so the story goes, met the devil at a crossroads, and the blues was born. Muddy Waters was raised in the same small town, as was Ike Turner, the man credited with writing the first rock’n’roll song, ‘Rocket 88’.And it was in Memphis that an introverted, rather strange 19-year-old man picked up his battered guitar one summer’s night in 1954, sang an old blues number ‘That’s all right (Mama)’, and changed the world forever. They say all roads lead to Memphis, and in Memphis all roads lead to Graceland, the home of that young man, Elvis Aron Presley.            Elvis bought the modest mansion in 1957, and he lived there until his sad, lonely death only 20 years later at the age of 42. It is now one of most visited historical houses in America, second only to the White House.It is unexpectedly poignant. He had clearly tried to create a haven of peace here, a home where he and his family and friends could hide from the suffocating fame that eventually killed him. Even the vicious green shag-pile carpet in his infamous den seemed comforting.READ MORE: Susan Dalgety: The party city where only musicians keep timeGrowing up with the Beatles, then Bowie, I used to think Elvis Presley was an old-fashioned crooner, someone your auntie liked, a hillbilly rocker with greasy hair who starred in cheesy films.I had no idea that before Elvis, blues music was played by black people, country by their white neighbours, and gospel by both, but never together.            I was blind to the fact that, before Elvis, radio stations and record labels, like everything in the south, were divided by colour.It was Elvis, guided by the effervescent record producer Sam Phillips, who, as if by magic, merged the blues, country and gospel and created the soundtrack to the modern world.He didn’t “steal” black music, as some have accused him. He absorbed it from an early age, growing up in poor neighbourhoods in Tupelo, then Memphis.He lived and breathed rhythm and blues. He had soul. And a voice that Placido Domingo yearned for: “His was the one voice I wish to have had,” said the tenor.Memphis is also home to Stax Records, the label that produced some of the best soul music of the 20th century.Stax was home to legends like Isaac Hayes, Carla Thomas and her father Rufus, Booker T and the MGs, and the almost mythical Otis Redding.Otis died aged only 26 years old, when his plane crashed into a lake in Wisconsin. He had yet to finish his biggest hit, ‘Sittin’ on the Dock of a Bay’, but listening now the whistled verse seems an integral part of the classic record.And his legacy lives on, even beyond the beautiful music he made. The annual Otis Music Camps provide young people with soul and music education, and his wife, Zelma is opening a charter school in his birthplace of Macon, Georgia, later this year.READ MORE: Susan Dalgety: USA – a land born of racism and slavery returns to its rootsIt aims to “empower students to maximise their full potential through integration of arts and academics”. Just as the Soulsville Charter school does in South Memphis. It is the legacy of Stax Records, which folded in 1975, and is now considered the best public school in the state.These schools may never produce another Elvis or Otis, but that is not their aim. They want to create “well-rounded and well-prepared leaders for a world of tomorrow” – leaders with soul.The man currently in charge of the country is creating a cacophony all of his own. Since Trump’s controversial meeting with Vladimir Putin on Monday, the airwaves here have been jumping. Words like treason and traitor are being used by respected, usually measured, commentators to describe the President of the United States.The former director of the CIA, John Brennan, was apoplectic at what he saw as his commander-in-chief’s betrayal, tweeting that Trump’s press conference with Putin was “nothing short of treasonous. Not only were Trump’s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you???”The country is in the midst of a nervous breakdown. Not even the soothing tones of the Reverend Al Green could calm it down just now.But a few thousand miles away in sunny South Africa, a middle-aged, grey-haired African American got to his feet, and a familiar voice resonated across the oceans. “Keep believing. Keep marching. Keep building. Keep raising your voice. Every generation has the opportunity to remake the world,” said President Barack Obama, in his speech to mark Nelson Mandela’s 100th birthday. “We don’t just need one leader ... what we badly need is that collective spirit. “Mandela said young people are capable when aroused of bringing down the towers of oppression and raising the banners of freedom. Now is a good time to be aroused.”Amen brother, amen."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772036.1532164446!/image/image.jpg","title":"work on the queensferry crossing to continue for another 18 months","story":"        Work on the Queensferry Crossing will not be completed until the end of next year, ministers have admitted.                The news follows drivers over the River Forth suffering months of delays from snagging work, which was due to be finished in September.            However, new transport secretary Michael Matheson has revealed that painting the underside of the road deck will not now be finished until December 2019.            This is because of delays installing a platform to ensure the safety of workers in all weathers.It means the finishing touches will not be put to the bridge until more than two years after it opened last August.Last November, it was revealed that off-peak lane closures would continue for ten months to finish the project.But Mr Matheson said the painting work would not affect drivers.He said contractors building the £1.35 billion crossing had “confirmed that undertaking this work will not compromise the use or integrity of the structure and traffic flow will not be impacted”. In a letter to Holyrood’s rural economy and connectivity committee, he said: “Whilst Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors (FCBC) have provided their firm assurance that the work will be completed, they have requested a relaxation of the delivery timescale to deliver the work in the most economical manner possible, allowing them to better manage available resources.            “In this context, and in the knowledge the work will be completed at no additional cost to the public purse, I consider it appropriate that additional time is permitted to allow the contractor to work in the most economical fashion and to complete the works by the end of 2019.”Mr Matheson said his officials had been assured by FCBC they were on schedule to complete the rest of the 23-point snagging and finishing list by September. It includes lighting, drainage and concrete work.Last November, one carriageway was closed for five days for repairs after surfacing around expansion joints was laid too highTransport Scotland had said the snagging work would have a “minimal impact” on traffic.            However, drivers have complained that even late evening Edinburgh-Fife trips have taken twice as long as normal because of lane closures.John Baxter tweeted: “What’s going on with Queensferry Crossing? It’s back to looking like a building site. What a mess and many delays.”Peter C tweeted: “10pm. Long queue when you just want to get home! Finish this bridge!”Neil Greig, of motoring group IAM RoadSmart, said: “Despite assurances on traffic flow being unaffected, any activity around the bridge could cause delay due to distraction or extra works vehicle movement. Although it is absolutely essential the builders get everything right, these ongoing uncertainties are not good for people and businesses trying to plan ahead.“Traffic management around the bridge also needs to be constantly reviewed to maximise the benefits of the massive investment in this new iconic structure.            “So far, a few extra days of unlimited operation during high winds seems little reward for drivers who still find themselves in long queues every morning and evening.”Scottish Labour transport spokesman Colin Smyth said: “The Scottish Government have consistently claimed the crossing would be completed by September, so it is hugely frustrating this work will drag on for another year.“The SNP are quick to pat themselves on the back when it comes to the crossing, but they’ve been slow admitting to the yet more delays and the failure of the contract to deliver on time.”His Scottish Conservatives counterpart Jamie Greene said: “In its first year, the bridge has been subject to constant congestion and lane closures as contractors perform vital work that should have already been completed.“Minor works on infra-\u2028structure projects are expected, but given the time it is \u2028taking to complete them, it raises questions about whether the bridge was opened too early.”A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “It was always our intention to open the bridge at the earliest opportunity to ensure the benefits of a more reliable crossing over the Forth could be realised quickly.“FCBC has informed us they intend to complete all outstanding work, apart from under deck painting, by the end of September.“All of this work forms part of the original contract and there is no additional cost to the public purse.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772126.1532171522!/image/image.jpg","title":"uk heading for no deal brexit jacob rees mogg","story":"        Hardline Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has said Britain is heading for a no deal exit from the EU.

Mr Barnier openly questioned the credibility of the UK’s proposals in his first response to the Government’s white paper on Brexit.And in comments that will likely alarm arch-Brexiteers in Tory ranks, the vice president of the European Parliament, and MEP for Ireland’s governing Fine Gael party, Mairead McGuinness, made it clear that Mrs May would need to abandon some of her red lines to clinch a deal.Speaking to the BBC, she said of London’s proposals: “It’s a starting point, it’s not an end deal.“I think the British Prime Minister set out red lines too early on and too deeply.            “We are prepared to show flexibility if the British Prime Minister can show flexibility.”Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood insisted the white paper was a workable compromise.He told the BBC: “There is no yes/yes solution here which will balance out the extreme views of the Brexiteers and the extreme views of the Remainers.“It is therefore essential that we have compromise.READ MORE: MPs visit farm to highlight ‘crisis’ of berry picker shortage             “And this is exactly what the white paper does.“It means that we have for the Remainers, we have access to goods and services, a deal with Europe as well.“We have financial markets as well.“And on the Leave campaign side of things, the bill, the EU bill stops. We leave the customs union, we leave the agricultural policy, we leave the common fisheries policy, and, of course, we are able to strike our own deals.”The comments came after Mr Barnier expressed concern that Mrs May’s proposal for a “facilitated customs arrangement” opened up the risk of major fraud, additional bureaucracy and damage to EU businesses.Meanwhile, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said she ‘hated’ the Chequers compromise, according to The Times which said it was quoting minutes of the Cabinet meeting at the PM’s country residence earlier in July."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ferry to leave early 2 ","story":"\nThe vessel will now leave at 4.30pm bound for Hatston Pier in Kirkwall and Aberdeen.\nWhat a brilliant picture of the northlink ferry.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.

A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials.

Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward.

A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"vacancy kitchen assistant and dispatch assistant with sandwick baking co ","story":" We currently have a vacancy in our kitchen department assisting in making our range of filled products and also selected confectionery lines.\n We also have a vacancy in our dispatch department wrapping, labelling products and making up customers orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best

conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and

obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nSaturday 21 Jul 2018 9:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_0946-e1530785665580.jpg","title":"harold davis 1933 2018 from the korean front line to footballing glory and a spot of fishing in wester","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nHis surname should in fact better reflect the Wester Ross area he’s called home for almost 40 years.\n“I like that to be known up here in MacKenzie country,” he notes from his home near Badachro, on the shores of Gairloch. “My mother was Catherine MacQueen Kirk, and my father was Angus Davis, though originally he was born Angus MacKenzie. The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-the-visitor-large-1.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

Derry will take to the streets tonight to challenge what Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald has described as the \"warped, negative, regressive , and dangerous\" agenda of those behind the disturbances that have occurred in the city\u0027s Bogside area in recent nights. \nA rally in solidarity with the local community will be held in the city tonight at 7pm, supported by a range of parties and organisations, at Fahan Street/Butcher Gate. \nIt follows several nights of disturbances in the area which included a gun attack on PSNI officers, several blast bombs and dozens of petrol bombs. \nSome of those involved in the disturbances have been young children. \nThe Sinn Féin leader encouraged as many people as possible to attend tonight\u0027s rally to show solidarity with the people of the Bogside and Fountain and to send a clear message that there is no support for the violence witnessed over the last week. \nMary Lou McDonald made the comments in the Bogside this afternoon alongside Sinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O\u0027Neill as they met with local residents and community leaders and ahead of a meeting with PSNI Chief Constable, George Hamilton, to discuss the violence. \n\nSpeaking to the media at the Gasyard Centre in the Bogside, Mary Lou McDonald said those behind the violence had a \"warped agenda\" and \"cynical, calculated manipulation of young people.\" \n\"What we have witnessed here is a sustained and a calculated attack on the community of the Bogside, spilling into the Fountain and the whole of the city of Derry,\" she said. \n\"What we have seen here is a deliberate strategy by those who would style themselves as dissidents to misuse, mislead and manipulate children and to cause fear, hardship and anger across this community. \n\"But they have also created a sense of determination, Because this is Derry and because the Bogside is the Bogside and the people here aren\u0027t having it. This is the city of Martin McGuinness, of John Hume, of civil rights, this is the maiden city, these are proud communities and this evening the people of the Bogside and beyond will come on to the street and stand shoulder to shoulder to face the thuggery, the criminality, the manipulation and the warped thinking of a small, small minority of people who would wish to cause damage here,\" the Sinn Féin leader added. \nMary Lou McDonald also said the local community are angry and that what has happened is not a reflection of the vast majority of local people. \n\"This is every reflection on warped, negative, regressive , dangerous people who think it is OK to manipulate young people and young children to throw petrol bombs and the like for an agenda that is nothing but a road to absolutely nowhere bar anger, fear and destruction,\" she explained. \nThe Sinn Féin President also said the PSNI have a responsibility to keep people safe but laid the blame for the disturbances squarely on dissident groupings. \n\"There is a sense in the community that the police need to do more, that there needs to be a more effective engagement but let me be clear about this, we will talk to George Hamilton about all of those things but be clear here who the instigator of this hardship is, let\u0027s be clear on that. That problem here emanates from so-called dissident elements who are behaving in a manner that no person could describe at any stage to be a republican behaviour,\" she said. \nShe also called on those orchestrating the violence to listen to the voice of the local community and stop immediately. \n\"The important thing is that they listen to the people of Derry because these street, this place is their home, this is where they have grown up, generation after generation, raised their kids, made good lives in what is a fantastic city often in very difficult circumstances and I tell you this, particularly the older residents, have said \u0027we are not having this, nobody every broke us and the dissidents and their sick approach will not break us either\u0027 so I hope they hear that, not from me, but from the people of the Bog.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27416  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\n“I welcome acknowledgement by RTÉ of the growing frustration among people in the north at the constant blockage of sports programmes on satellite TV.  - Sinéad Ennis\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis has called on RTÉ’s new Head of Sport to take the concerns and growing frustration among northern viewers on board when negotiating deals for GAA coverage with satellite providers. \nThe block on major sports programmes for northern viewers is continuously causing anger among sports fans, this was increased with the recent geo-blocking of The Sunday Game on RTÉ. \nThis frustration is matched by a recent cut in coverage by the BBC to the 2018 GAA Ulster Championship from seven live games to two has causing huge anger among GAA members and fans in the north. \nGAA fans expressed their frustration on social media as BBC provided no live coverage of Super 8 games, despite a clear public interest for coverage with three Ulster teams competing in the competition.\nWriting in the Gaelic Life, RTÉ’s new Head of Sport said they “don’t geo-block” citing that your internet service provider address governs whether or not you have access to a particular outlet. \nSinn Féin’s Culture, Arts \u0026amp Sports spokesperson Sinéad Ennis said she recognises the complexities in licensing and broadcasting rights, but that there is a responsibility on RTÉ to address the “digital partition” of Ireland. \n“I welcome an acknowledgement by RTÉ of the growing frustration among people in the north at the constant blockage of sports programmes on satellite TV. \n“RTÉ negotiate deals with satellite providers such as SKY, therefore they are in a position to renegotiate the terms to meet the needs of northern viewers,” she said. \nThe South Down Gael recently launched the ‘Fair Play For Ulster Gaels’ campaign to ensure that the 250,000 Gaels in the north would no longer be left behind when it comes to viewing rights. \nThe campaign, which included a Twitter poll, was endorsed by 95% of those who voted.

Incidentally, both of those claims were the highest in the 40-member chamber.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a02f.jpg","title":"65207  ","story":"    \nTHE Department of Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairs believes that the recent sustained spell of hot weather - rather than pollution - has led to the deaths of a number of fish in a section of the Dunore River near Antrim.\nLocal man, James Cousley - who has lived on the Drennans Road\u0026#160 for more than 70 years - was distressed when he discovered the fish in the river, which runs alongside his property.\n\u0026#8220That river has been polluted before, less than two years ago, he said.\nBut after two visits by officials, DAERA was able to confirm that pollution had not caused the fish to die on this occasion.\nA\u0026#160 spokesperson said: The recent warm weather has led to high water temperatures in conjunction with lower base river flows in many waterways and this can have an adverse impact on the fishery and river ecology. \n\u0026#8220It is not unusual for dissolved oxygen levels to drop to critically low levels, particularly at night, which can result in fish mortalities.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a01f.jpg","title":"65208  ","story":"    \nSINISTER footage has emerged of a masked man pointing a gun out the window of a house at a pre-Twelfth Church parade in Randalstown.\nSunday\u0027s annual parade saw brethren from Randalstown District LOL No 22 and members of two local bands taking part in a church service and act of Remembrance.\nAs the bands and the brethren - including young children - made their way down Station Road, watched by spectators, they were unaware of a more sinister set of eyes trained upon them.\nVideo footage, which has spread on social media, shows a man in a beret and camouflage jacket with his face obscured by a scarf and sunglasses, raising what looks like an assault rifle before training it on those marching.\nWatching from a house on the route, he is being filmed as he appears to cock the rifle.\nAs the camera pans back towards the parade going past the house, he points the weapon in its direction before a disturbing \u0027click\u0027 - believed to be the trigger being pulled - can be heard off-camera.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06f1.jpg","title":"65301  ","story":"    \nMUCKAMORE Seconds have reached the Ulster Plate final against Ardmore Seconds or Donemana Seconds on August 19.\nAnd the club\u0027s First XI gained more valuable points when they travelled to Stormont on Saturday to play CSNI in their latest Premier League match and completed the double over their arch-rivals in a vitally important game. \nThe fixture marked the debut of new signing Adam McDaid, who has joined this week from North West Club, Eglinton. \nThis weekend Muckamore travel to Armagh seeking a win against the bottom team, which would almost certainly secure the Antrim club\u0027s position in the Premier League next season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f1.jpg","title":"65302  ","story":"    \nANOTHER break between rugby seasons draws to an end this week as Randalstown Rugby Club\u0027s pre-season training begins.\nAfter a 10-week period in which the senior squad had the opportunity to get some excellent strength and conditioning work completed at Ballymena Academy under the guidance of Ryan Keating, the players now return to the pitch.\nThis season, Randalstown will field three senior sides in the Ulster Branch leagues with the First XV in Qualifying League 2, the Second XV in Junior League 3 and the Third XV in Junior League 6.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a04f.jpg","title":"65303  ","story":"    \nTHE Opening Ceremony for the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship will take place in Antrim this weekend.\nTwo hundred young people representing USA, Russia, Belgium, Great Britain, Republic of Ireland, France, Denmark, Canada and Northern Ireland will compete, live and learn together in the town as part of the Atlantic Challenge. \nDuring the week-long contest, 38-foot wooden gigs will be sailed and rowed on Lough Neagh.

She was devoted to the needs of the less fortunate in Romania.  Both her and Samuel travelled many times to Romania thus allowing Barbara to speak passionately at home in Northern Ireland at many events and meetings. At the same time Barbara was busy fundraising, filling and organising containers to be transported out to Romania with all kinds of essential supplies and gifts and was still finding time to help Samuel on their farm.\n\nBarbara inspired many others in the community to travel out to Romania to help the people there in any way they could and see for themselves the need that Barbara so passionately spoke of back home.\n\nBarbara was a people’s person and this was certainly borne out by the large attendance at her funeral at Toberdoney Presbyterian Church last Monday and all those who paid their fitting tributes having travelled from near and far.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBarbara’s passing has left a huge void for her husband Samuel, her father Jim, brother Robin and sister Alison, nephews, nieces, wider family and all who knew her. She was predeceased by her mother Grace.\n\nThe charity ‘Smiles’ has also paid tribute to Barbara on its website.\n\nIt said the Smiles Family is now one less, adding: “It is hard to imagine life or Smiles without her’ but we thank God for the amazing legacy of achievement that Barbara leaves, for what she meant to so many and look forward to continuing the work in Romania which Barbara so passionately loved and supported.”\n\nThoughts and prayers go out to Samuel and the family circle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try { _402_Show() } catch(e) {}    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8571942.1531923675!/image/image.jpg","title":"children s charity to benefit from ni open","story":"\nThe Northern Ireland Open, which takes place at Galgorm Castle from August 15-19, has selected Cancer Fund for Children as its official charity partner for 2018.\n\n                \nThe local charity will benefit from the tournament next month, which will see 156 European Tour golfers take to the course, as well as an extensive schedule of events and activities away from the fairways to entertain all the family.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAs well as selling the official programme for the NI Open, the charity will benefit from a range of events including an Ambassadors Q\u0026ampA Evening on August 14 in the Braid, and the Pro Am Dinner, following the Pro Am Day on August 15.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFunds raised from the tournament will enable Cancer Fund for Children to provide a range of practical, emotional and financial support to families affected by cancer, to help them cope with its impact on their lives.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe Taylor family from Ahoghill are just one local family who have benefitted from the charity’s support, after their 12-year-old daughter Molly was diagnosed with cancer in 2014.\n\nMum Lisa said: “When Molly was diagnosed with cancer, it was a massive shock.

A recent change to the law means that an MP who receives a suspension of more than 10 days must face a by-election if 10% of the voters in their constituency sign a petition asking for that.\n\nAlthough Mr Paisley has a huge majority in North Antrim, the 10% figure could easily be reached if many of those who voted against him in the last election chose to sign such a petition.\n\nThe Commons’ standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone – whose report into the matter went to the committee, which endorsed her findings – ruled that the DUP MP had received a “very substantial personal benefit” from the Government of Sri Lanka in the form of luxury holidays which were first revealed last year by The Daily .\n\nHe did not declare the visits – and then went on to lobby the Prime Minister on behalf of Sri Lanka’s controversial government.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn a report published this morning, the commissioner said: “These two visits to Sri Lanka provided a very substantial personal benefit to Mr Paisley and his family. “I find it surprising that such an experienced MP did not ask himself whether it was proper to accept such benefits from a foreign government. \n\n“I also find it surprising that he did not realise that, if accepted, these benefits would call into question his impartiality when he next spoke about the affairs of that government.\n\nThe commissioner found that Mr Paisley had “breached the House’s rule on paid advocacy by writing to the Prime Minister on 19 March 2014 asking for an exclusive benefit for Sri Lanka, having received personal benefit and hospitality from that government within the previous twelve months”.\n\nShe also found that he had “breached the House’s rules on declaration by failing to declare the personal benefit and hospitality from the Sri Lankan government in his letter to the Prime Minister of 19 March 2014”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, in a third finding against the veteran DUP figure, she found he “breached the House’s rules on registration of interests by failing to register within the 28 days agreed by the House the two visits made to Sri Lanka with family members in March/April 2013 and in July 2013”.\n\nThe Commons’ Standards Committee has now recommended that Mr Paisley be suspended from the Commons for 30 sitting days “in view of the seriousness of this matter”, with the suspension to start on 4 September.\n\nThe suspension will have to be endorsed by a vote in the House of Commons.\n\nMr Paisley responded to the report via a statement from his lawyer, Paul Tweed, and he hinted at the matter coming before the Commons tomorrow. Mr Tweed also said Mr Paisley was “considering” unspecified legal action against The Daily , over the way in which it broke the story last year.\n\nMr Tweed said: “My client has apologised unreservedly at the outset for his unintentional failure to register the hospitality he received.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While accepting the decision of the House Standards Committee, he nonetheless continues to take issue with the sensationalised report in the Daily . Legal proceedings are being considered.\n\n“No further comment will be made until Mr Paisley has addressed the House on Thursday.”\n\nIn a letter to the commissioner during her investigation, Mr Paisley said: “I certainly refute any claims that I made an intentional decision not to register, that it was a secret that I was in Sri Lanka, or, worse, that it impacted any comments or decisions I made then or now as a Parliamentarian. None of those claims can in any way be substantiated”.\n\nBut, drawing attention to Mr Paisley’s political experience and the fact he had registered other trips the commissioner said he “must have been aware that there are particular sensitivities about accepting gifts and hospitality from foreign governments”.\n\nShe added: “It is difficult, therefore, to avoid the conclusion that the reason why the third visit was registered and the two earlier ones were not, was that Mr Paisley was conscious of the potential embarrassment that would be caused to him were it to become publicly known that he had accepted very expensive hospitality, for himself and his family, from a foreign government accused of serious human rights violations.”\n\nShe also put it to Mr Paisley in writing during her investigation that he had written to the Prime Minister “urging the government to change its position on a UN motion to the benefit of Sri Lanka. You had received financial benefits from the Sri Lankan government in the previous 12 months. That was a breach of the rule against paid advocacy”.\n\nThe full report is online here: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmstandards/1397/1397.pdf\n            \n    \n    try { _402_Show() } catch(e) {}    \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_866291.jpg--.jpg?1531813262000\n","title":"ballymena gets in frame with new dementia project","story":"  \nBALLYMENA will be in the frame over the summer months as a new group of friends get out and about together as part of an exciting new walking and photography group. \n  \nDoury Road Youth Group and Alzheimer’s Society are just two of the 30 groups which have been partnered in the ‘Peacing Ages Together’ PEACE IV project.\n  \nThe project has been supported through the European Union’s PEACE IV Programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB).\n  \nThis intergenerational partnership is the first to meet out of 15 cross-community partnerships created by MEAAP, and they plan to visit local beauty spots over the summer, for walks and photography sessions.\n  \nThese will then form an arts project they will take part in together in September.\n  \nTwelve older people who live with dementia will meet up with 12 young people and spend 10 sessions together having fun and making new friends over the next few months.\n  \nMEAAP Peace IV Project Officer Sarah McLaughlin said: “This is an amazing opportunity for young people to build their awareness of dementia and take part in fun activities with older people who have so many experiences to share.\n  \n“The ‘Peacing Ages Together’ project is all about tackling loneliness and building friendships between people who may not normally get the chance to meet in everyday life. \n  \n“We have 14 more partnerships just like this one who are meeting for the first time and getting to enjoy new adventures together through 2018/2019.\n  \n“We are supporting each partnership to participate in 10 fun activity sessions ranging from circus skills workshops to cooking food from around the world.
