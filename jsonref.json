He did not specify howA lawyer for AMI meanwhile described the source on Sunday by stating: \u0027The story was given to The National Enquirer by a reliable source that had been giving information to the National Enquirer for seven years prior to this story. It was a source that was well known to both Mr. Bezos and Miss Sanchez.\u0027                            They were talking marriage. The three of us had discussed before that, at some point, this was going to be a scandal. My advice was, let’s get to the other side. Our analogy was always that they were landing a 747. I told them, You’re both pilots and you’ve never landed a 747, but that’s what we’re trying to do here.\u0027                        Michael makes an analogy comparing his sister\u0027s affair to a large plan  His sister is actually the second person close to Michael whose texts have shown up in The National Enquirer recently, with the tabloid also running racy exchanges between Fox Business Network host Charles Payne and Scottie Nell Hughes. American Media defended the emails sent by the National Enquirer\u0027s Chief Content Officer and the firm\u0027s legal team threatening to publish nude photos of Bezos and Sanchez if he did not drop an investigation into how editors learned of the billionaire\u0027s affair.  \u0027American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos. Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him,\u0027 the company said in a statement released on Friday. \u0027Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.\u0027            Cheers: His sister is actually the second person close to Michael whose texts have shown up in The National Enquirer, with Scotty Neal Hughes (above) suffering a similar leakThe American Media board is comprised of four iniduals, including: owner David Pecker Evan Ratner, a partner  at Chatham Asset Management Barry Schwartz, also a partner at at Chatham Asset Management and David R. Hughes, the former executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer of Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc. Chatham Asset Management has an 80 percent stake in American Media according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, it was revealed on Friday that federal prosecutors were reviewing the emails sent by AMI to Bezos in order to determine if the company violated its immunity deal by blackmailing Bezos. Bezos meanwhile said that he believed Saudia Arabia played a role in AMI\u0027s decision last week.\u0027Several days ago, an AMI leader advised us that Mr. Pecker is “apoplectic” about our investigation. For reasons still to be better understood, the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve,\u0027 wrote Bezos in a post on Thursday.\u0027A few days after hearing about Mr. Pecker’s apoplexy, we were approached, verbally at first, with an offer. They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn’t stop our investigation.\u0027When asked if there was any Saudi involvement in the leaking of Bezos\u0027 texts on Friday, the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs Adel Jubeir said \u0027I doubt it,\u0027 and then a short while later said \u0027no.\u0027   “My Only Goal Has Been to Protect Jeff and Lauren”: Michael Sanchez, Suspected Bezos Leaker, Supplies His Own Theory About the Affair, the Enquirer, Some Below-the-Belt Selfies, and “a Legendary Romance” | Vanity Fair"},{"url":null,"title":"Runner says fought mountain lion stepping neck","story":"    Recovering from his ordeal, Travis Kauffman, 31, has come forward as the man who killed a mountain lion that attacked him as he was on a run on February 4 by stepping on its neck and suffocating it to death          Kauffman opened up about the traumatizing animal fight on Thursday during a press conference held by Colorado Parks and Wildlife, North East region          Travis Kauffman (pictured above following the attack), says the lion locked its jaws on his wrist and was clawing his face and arms during the February 4 attack, leaving his with bloody gashes across his nose and cheek          Kauffman pictured above with his girlfriend Annie Bierbouer before speaking about the life-threatening lion attack on ThursdayKauffman, accompanied by his girlfriend Annie Bierbower, spoke on the horrifying experience in a interview with state wildlife officials on Thursday. The experienced runner said he was heading out on a trail at the Horsetooth Mountain Park when the lion appeared and pounced on him.When the creature pinned him down, Kauffman said his \u0027fear response turned into more of a fight response\u0027 and he began to attack the lion. The lion leaped on Kauffman and locked its jaws on his wrists and started clawing his face and arms.\u0027It was going up towards my face so I threw up my hands to kind of block my face, at which point it grabbed onto my hand and wrist and from there it started to claw at my face and neck.

In a video shared by Colorado Parks and Wildlife the injuries to his face are visible          He retraced his steps in the mountainous trail in Fort Collins with wildlife officials to give a play by play account of the mountain lion attack           Tracing his steps at the Horsetooth Mountain park he found the paw marks of mountain lionsWith a burst of energy Kauffman wrestled the young giant cat to the ground, hit its head with a rock and futilely tried to stab it in the neck with twigs. As they fought each other they ended up rolling onto the south end of the trail. \u0027From there it was just like a wrestling match,\u0027 Kauffman said. Finally, Kauffman managed to pin down the lion\u0027s back legs with his knee then lodged his foot on the cat\u0027s neck and suffocated the animal to death. \u0027Because I\u0027m a recent cat owner, I know that the back claws are pretty dangerous when it comes down to an attack. And I was pretty worried about its claws just sinking into my my stomach and groin area,\u0027 Kauffman said to radio show KUNC.\u0027I was able to shift my weight and get a foot on its neck. … I stepped on its neck with my right foot and just slowly after a few minutes I thought I would be getting close and then it would start thrashing again and I had a few more scratches that resulted from those thrashes at that point, and I’d say another couple minutes later it finally stopped moving,\u0027 Kauffman recalled. Kauffman managed to walk away from the animal fight with his life, suffering bloody gashes running along his face and arms.    Injuries: The Colorado Parks and Wildlife shared these pictures of his bloody gashes and lacerations to his face and neck          He said the lion pinned him down at his wrists and started to attack his face and neck          Kauffman also suffered scratches on his legs in the attack and required 20 stitches to recoverHe suffered numerous wounds including lacerations on his nose and cheek and required about 20 stitches to recover.  By Thursday he had largely recovered from his ordeal but still sported a scar across his cheek from the attack. Kauffman said he\u0027s saddened that he killed the animal, but during the attack he wasn\u0027t even sure if it was actually dead. After the animal seemed unresponsive he ran off, worried more predators might be lurking nearby. The whole fight lasted about 10 grueling minutes.\u0027I was on a crazy fear high,\u0027 he said on the fight.  Kauffman ended up running three miles to get out of the park. He found another runner and a park visitor who jogged with him to a trailhead. Once there he was given a ride to the hospital and treated for his injuries. Wildlife officials released a statement saying that Kauffman was very lucky to escape the attack with his life. \u0027We all feel extremely lucky that this attack was made by a young mountain lion on a knowledgeable runner, otherwise we may have been hosting a very different press conference,\u0027 Mark Leslie, a Colorado Parks and Wildlife manager, said as per CBS. \u0027These animals are ambush predators, and are trained to take quick and lethal action whenever possible,\u0027 he added.          Larimer County officials reported increased mountain lion activity in the area and increased patrols on trails the day after the attack. File image of a mountain lion above Kauffman is originally from Arkansas but has lived in Colorado for over five years. He\u0027s a seasoned runner and frequented the Fort Collins trail at the Horsetooth Mountain park for a year. He was planning to go on a 12 to 15 mile run on the day of the attack. Following the attack the park was closed but finally reopened this week. Larimer County officials reported increased mountain lion activity in the area and increased patrols on trails the day after the attack.  \u0027We have removed additional lions that we believe are siblings of the lion involved in last Monday’s attack,\u0027 Leslie said. Those lions, also juveniles, will be moved to a rehabilitation facility and will be re-released into the wild. While the park is back up and running, officials warn there\u0027s still a chance visitors will find mountain lions there.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Former RHOBH star Eden Sassoon unveils new look face lift","story":"    Fresh faced!

Above, a surgeon peels back her face and slices chunks of skin away  Our cameras captured the graphic moment a surgeon peeled back the star\u0027s face and sliced chunks of skin away.But while footage of the three-hour procedure may be gruesome, the end result is undoubtedly impressive with no visible scars or marks.Eden says the \u0027incredible\u0027 face-lift, performed earlier this month, has truly boosted her confidence.\u0027I look amazing. I feel 24, I\u0027m 45. It\u0027s been an incredible experience. I see myself in the mirror and that\u0027s me,\u0027 she told DailyMailTV. \u0027I\u0027ve been exercising a lot. I feel like I feel as if this is how I should have always been.\u0027I showed up there 45 minutes early, I was dancing and singing. From the moment we decided to do this I\u0027ve been ready. I\u0027ve wanted to do this for the last four or five years.\u0027The AuraLyft face-lift uses the same technique as facial reconstruction for cancer patients.The procedure was conducted by Dr. Ben Talei, one of the most respected facial plastic surgeons in the country, who was featured in September on CBS show The Doctors.His state of the art Beverly Hills Center for Plastic \u0026amp Laser Surgery specializes in advanced face-lift procedures, rhinoplasty, eyebrow lifts, non-surgical skin rejuvenation, among other things.

I really don\u0027t know what he\u0027s doing, but oh it feels tighter there,\u0027 she said The AuraLyft technique requires only a local anesthetic to the patient\u0027s face, which reduces recovery time and cost, but also meant Eden was awake during the procedure as our camera rolled.And the blonde beauty says she experienced every moment.\u0027I was really nervous about that,\u0027 Eden confessed. \u0027But everyone in the room was so incredibly full of love and positive energy that I felt so safe. I could hear them speak and I could feel them turn my neck and pull this way, and I could make noises. If I really tried, I probably could have opened my eyes and spoke.\u0027I was lying there and in my own head I\u0027m thinking, Wow, this is really an interesting experience. I really don\u0027t know what he\u0027s doing, but oh it feels tighter there. I could feel him touch my leg every sort of 30, 45 seconds and it, and it gave me this sense of calm.

But I think it\u0027s more of an internal job. I wasn\u0027t happy with this extra skin. I wasn\u0027t happy with my neck.\u0027And thanks to Dr Talei that\u0027s now fixed.\u0027AuraLyft is completely different and the best type to do on anybody,\u0027 Dr Talei said.\u0027Without the need for fat grafting or fillers it gives the maximum that any surgery can give you in terms of rejuvenation of the face and neck while also providing the absolute most natural outcome from the top of the brow to the bottom of the neck.\u0027Dr Talei said the procedure on Eden was a \u0027zero-tension lift\u0027, requiring no stitches, but took off a lot of skin.\u0027She\u0027s only mid-40s and she had a shocking amount of laxity in the skin, and that\u0027s usually the case for someone who\u0027s getting a face-lift a little younger. We took off enough skin to form a wallet, a woman\u0027s purse.\u0027She came back the next day and took the head wrap off, and already she looked great. We\u0027re doing a lot things now in the operation to prevent bruising and make sure they heal as quickly as possible, so she looked good in the first couple of days. Now about three weeks later she\u0027s doing Pilates and already looking great in photos.\u0027Dr Talei claims the results are so refined, \u0027that nobody, no matter how close they are to the patient, knows they\u0027ve had surgery.\u0027Eden said she wanted a more natural-looking face-lift, after getting compliments over her natural look compared to her \u0027glammed-up\u0027 appearance in Real Housewives.\u0027There are eyes on you and everyone\u0027s gonna have their own judgment.

Britain\u0027s biggest ever...Holby City star John Michie\u0027s daughter is only person in the...Share this article\u0027Christopher Hampton\u0027s play is drawn from the testimony Pomsel gave when she finally broke her silence, shortly before she died, to a group of Austrian filmmakers, and from their documentary A German Life.\u0027Dame Maggie will be alone on stage for the entire production, directed by Jonathan Kent.She was last on stage in The Lady From Dubuque in 2007.       Brunhilde Pomsel worked Joseph Goebbels but denied any knowledge of what was going on in the Nazi party Born in 1911, Brunhilde Pomsel left school in 1926 and started an apprenticeship with a Jewish wholesale manufacturer.But as the Great Depression hit Germany - leading to the rise of the Nazis - she became unemployed, before getting a job as a shorthand secretary for Jewish insurance broker Dr Hugo Goldberg.Dr Goldberg, like many Jews, fled Germany after Hitler gained power in 1933 so Pomsel began working for author Wulf Bley, who was closely connected to the Nazi Party.She used these connections to get a job with the German Broadcasting Station radio channel and joined the Nazi party.Joseph Goebbels spent much of his time at the radio station making speeches, and offered her a job as his assistant.Thrilled to be working with the second most important person in the Third Reich, she jumped at the opportunity.But she insisted that she was not aware of the \u0027Final Solution\u0027 - the extermination of millions of Jews in death camps in Germany, Austria and German-occupied Poland - until after the war and said Goebbels \u0027must have kept correspondence about it away from her sight.\u0027She was inside the Fuhrer\u0027s bunker in Berlin in May 1945 when he shot himself as the Red Army closed in on his lair. After the war Pomsel was captured by Soviet troops and jailed for five years.Astonishingly, after being released from prison in 1950, she went back to working in broadcasting in democratic West Germany until her eventual retirement in 1971. She is not thought to have married or had children.    It was only in 2011 that she re-emerged, when a German newspaper published an interview with her and sparking a flurry of interest in the last surviving members of the Nazi leadership\u0027s inner circle. In a documentary Pomsel talked about her three years working for the man responsible for spreading Hitler\u0027s poisonous ideology in newspapers and across the airwaves.She said: \u0027I wouldn\u0027t see myself as being guilty. Unless you end up blaming the entire German population for ultimately enabling that government to take control. That was all of us. Including me.\u0027 Pomsel described in the film how she was told to keep the Nazi top brass supplied with alcohol \u0027in order to retain the numbness\u0027 and stave off the reality of their imminent defeat by the hated Russians.                                                       In 2011, Brunhilde Pomsel broke a 66-year vow of silence about the Nazi regime when she gave an interview to popular German newspaper Bild. Her revelations about the Nazi power circle\u0027s last moments shocked the world.She revealed that even after a lifetime of service, Goebbels barely acknowledged her: \u0027You couldn\u0027t get close to him,\u0027 she said. \u0027He never once asked me a personal question. Right up until the end I don\u0027t think he knew my name\u0027.Pomsel spent the last 10 days of the Third Reich in the cellars of the propaganda ministry as Russian artillery and American bombers flattened her surroundings.She continued to pump out orders from Goebbels until the very last minute - when Goebbels shot his wife then himself.Immediately before the murder-suicide, Goebbels and his wife killed their six young children by breaking cyanide vials into their mouth.Aides were ordered to pour petrol on the corpses of the dead generals - but the remains were only partially burned, and later found by the Red Army.On May 1 1945, shortly after \u0027The Boss\u0027 - Hitler - committed suicide, the Russians came into the bunker and \u0027dragged\u0027 Pomsel out. She spent the next five years as a prisoner of the Russians in special camps.She claims not to have known about the Holocaust: \u0027I was a stupid, politically uninterested little sausage of simple means. I only learned about the Jewish extermination programme after the war. Goebbels never mentioned it in his correspondence.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Roma Mexican actor finally gets United States visa approved present Oscars","story":"    Jorge Antonio Guerrero, who starred in \u0027Roma\u0027, announced to his followers on Instagram that we will be travelling to Los Angeles for the Oscars           Guerrero is looking forward to the eventful night in Los Angeles on February 24 where \u0027Roma\u0027 is up for 10 gongs\u0027It\u0027s just too f**king dumb for words\u0027: Russell Crowe leads...Emilia Clarke and Jason Momoa named as Oscar presenters......Share this articleDuring his second meeting with U.S. immigration officials in Mexico City, Guerrero was asked if he was seeking a visa for employment north of the border. He said he was looking forward to attending one of the many events that have honored the hit movie.In January, \u0027Roma\u0027 won the Golden Globe for Director of a Motion Picture and and Foreign Language Film but Guerrero missed out on the festivities one again.Guerrero, who didn\u0027t have any acting experience until last year when he debuted in three series, including the Netflix hit, \u0027Narcos: Mexico\u0027, also saw another petition go down the drains towards the end of the year when he received an invitation from Netflix to attend a gala.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Kevin Spacey showed uninvited college party spent night trying swap cell numbers","story":"    Shafted: A student at Towson University recalled the the time Kevin Spacey showed up uninvited to a party on campus in 2015 (Spacey above at the 2015 party with a co-ed drinking out of a penis-shaped bottle)            This happened a year before he allegedly groped a teen at a Nantucket bar in July 2016 (Spacey leaving his arraignment in January)          Waving through a window: Spacey chats with some of the younger attendees at a party for the cast and crew of Dear Evan Hansen following the Tony Awards in June 2017 (above, with Harvey Weinstein in foreground with his back turned away from camera)Spacey spent a good deal of time in the area while filming House of Cards.He later bought a house in Baltimore where he has been holed up for the past year with manager Evan Lowenstein.On the night in question, it is not clear how he made his way to the college party, but his aims seemed clear to the eyewitness. Spacey asked that no one take pictures or post on social media, then mingled with some of the guests.\u0027I could\u0027t help but notice he sowed a particular interest in talking to young men at the party,\u0027 said the eyewitness.   \u0027He would ignore any girls at the party.\u0027 Spacey was also allegedly looking at one male student with \u0027an intense stare\u0027 as they spoke to hikm. \u0027He was asking to swap cell phone numbers,\u0027 said the eyewitness. Bill Cosby speaks out for the first time from prison as he...REVEALED: REI CEO who resigned over an affair is a...Rapper 21 Savage is released on bond after nine days in...Share this articleThis report comes after an eyewitness told a Nantucket detective that he saw Spacey groping a young man at a bar in 2016.Police interviews that have been filed in the sexual assault case against Spacey reveal that one man who was at the bar on the night the actor groped a teenage busboy had seen the Oscar winner touching another young man at the same establishment.Brian Buch, the man who was playing the piano at The Club Car that night did not witness Spacey groping his accuser, but did see him with another man earlier that summer.A police report that was obtained by DailyMail.com stated: \u0027Brian told me he witnessed Kevin Spacey touching a male who was celebrating his 21st birthday.\u0027It went on to state: \u0027To the left of Spacey was the man and to the right of Spacey were the man\u0027s parents.

The uncertainty over how the decision will be implemented remains.

Pictured is an early rendering by Airbus of the aircraft            Construction finally began in 2002. Pictured is a large section of fuselage being transported by road to the jetliner\u0027s final assembly plant in Toulouse, France          Parts for the A380 are produced across four European countries before being brought to Toulouse to be assembled. Pictured is a section of A380 being loaded on to a ship in Pauillac, France           A380 fuselage and wing sections are put on a freight ship ready to be shipped to Toulouse in October 2004           A barge carries an A380 central fuselage down a river in the French city of Bordeaux in April 2004, during the development and construction of the first superjumbos            A fuselage section for the A380 is moved to the double-deck jetliner\u0027s final assembly facility in Toulouse in October 2004 It was more than 30 years ago in 1988 when the idea for a super-sized 500-seat airliner was first mooted at Airbus. The aim? To directly challenge Boeing\u0027s extremely popular 747.By June 1994, Airbus announced it was to develop a very, very large double-decker airliner, called the A3XX.And six years later the $8.8billion (£6.8billion) project to develop the plane, renamed the A380, began in earnest.After the design of the huge new aircraft was finalised, construction finally began in 2002.          A section of fuselage is unloaded off a ship in Paulliac. A380 parts arrive by ship in Paulliac in France before being loaded on to barges to take them through Bordeaux to a dock at Langon and then by oversize road convoy to the assembly plant          A section of the first A380 fuselage arrives at the final assembly plant in Toulouse in January 2005, just months before the A380\u0027s maiden flight           Inside the Toulouse Airbus plant in January 2005, showing the first three A380s side by side as they are constructed            One of the construction milestones came in January 2005, when the first A380 Rolls-Royce engine was assembled            The first A380 passenger airliner is moved between hangars at the Airbus factory in Toulouse          Team effort: The forward and centre fuselages are made in France, the horizontal tail plane made in Spain and the tails fins and rear fuselages built in Germany          Workers gather in front of the nose cone of an Airbus A380 at the opening ceremony for the new final-assembly plant at Airbus\u0027s Toulouse factory in 2004. At that time, Airbus expected to sell more than 1,000 A380s. Total orders in the end totalled just over 320 The parts for the plane were built across Europe. The wings were constructed in Wales, the forward and centre fuselages made in France, the horizontal tail plane made in Spain and the tails fins and rear fuselages built in Germany.They were then brought by sea, air and road, to the production plant in Toulouse to be assembled. Roads around the plant had to be widened in order for the huge new plane parts to be transported in.The maiden flightAirbus finally unveiled the first five test A380s in Toulouse in 2005 and the first maiden flight took place on April 27 of that year.The giant plane touched down to applause after a flight of just under four hours. Nearly 30,000 spectators watched the behemoth take off and land.          In April 2005 the first A380 was moved from the assembly plant across a busy road to Airbus\u0027s flight test centre at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport           The A380 touches down in Toulouse after its maiden flight on April 27, 2005. The giant plane landed to applause after a flight of just under four hours    Airbus staff and media gather around the A380 after its maiden flight. During the first flight it recorded measurements for 150,000 separate parameters and beamed real-time data back to computers on the ground           The crew on the maiden flight took no chances - they donned parachutes and a handrail was installed inside the test plane leading from the cockpit to an escape door that could have been jettisoned had the pilots lost control. The plane was jointly captained by Claude Lelaie, Airbus\u0027 Senior Vice President Flight Division, and Chief Test Pilot and Vice President Jacques Rosay          Once testing of the aircraft was complete, the A380 went on a world tour. It first came to Britain in 2006 when it appeared at the Farnborough Airshow and flew alongside the RAF\u0027s Red Arrows           In March 2007, the A380 touched down on US soil for the first time, during its world tour. It is pictured landing at New York\u0027s JFK Airport             After landing at JFK, the world\u0027s largest passenger plane was honoured by the New York Fire Department, which sprayed water over the aircraft           While travelling around the US on a world tour, the A380 also made a pit stop in Washington DC. The aircraft is pictured flying across Capitol Hill and the Washington Monument           The A380 flies past the high rise buildings of Hong Kong during its world tour in 2007     The first customer to have an A380 delivered for service was Singapore Airlines.

It now has over 100 A380s in its fleet, making it the biggest customer.Following Singapore\u0027s lead, it created lavish cabins, with first class ticket holders given showers and private suites.Australian flag-carrier Qantas was third to take delivery of the A380 while British Airways received its first A380 in 2013. No US carrier has ever ordered an A380.Problems ariseDespite being launched to much fanfare and receiving orders from 13 different airlines, the A380 has been beset with issues.In November 2010, Qantas Airways and Singapore Airlines temporarily suspended flights of the A380 after an engine failure forced an emergency landing in Singapore.          In November 2010, the Airbus A380 test aircraft flew a special flight over the Pyramids in Egypt following airport compatibility tests carried out at Cairo International Airport to confirm the airport was capable of handling A380 operations           British Airways received its first A380 in July 2013 and on its arrival at Heathrow, BA staff greeted it with Union flags. BA has 12 A380s in its fleet And by July, 2016 Airbus announced that it was cutting production of the A380 in half, going to just one jet a month by 2018.By 2018, Airbus said it would have no other choice but to halt the costly A380 programme if Dubai\u0027s Emirates airline, its biggest customer of the A380, did not place another order.Last year Emirates Airlines struck a $16 billion (£12.3 billion) deal to buy 36 A380s, but it is now switching some orders to the smaller A350.Analysts have pointed to customers demanding flights directly to their destination rather than following Airbus\u0027s model of taking a long haul journey from hub-to-hub followed by a short hop on a smaller plane.          The 100th A380 was bought by Malaysia Airlines and delivered in March 2013          A special celebration was held at the Airbus factory in November 2017 when the 100th A380 for Emirates was handed over       Engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce secures order to build 140 aircraft engines for Emirates | City A.M."},{"url":null,"title":"No news not good news Donald Tusk trolls PM Brexit","story":"    Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok posed with a blue Brexit monster for an extraordinary photograph mocking the crucial issue          Donald Tusk (right) underlined his tough stance after holding talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier (left) in Brussels last night          The EU council president demanded the PM finds a way through the increasingly bitter rowMrs May has been pleading for more time to secure concessions from the EU on the Irish border backstop that could win MPs\u0027 support for her deal. But she is confronting fresh challenges to her authority tonight as she seeks endorsement from Parliament for her approach, with Tory hardliners accusing her of trying to rule out a no-deal Brexit by stealth and threatening to join forces with Labour to inflict a stinging defeat.Trade Secretary Liam Fox pleaded with his colleagues not to rebel, warning that the Commons is not an \u0027internal debating society\u0027 and it would \u0027send the wrong signals\u0027 to Brussels. May slumps to crushing 303 to 258 Brexit defeat at hands of...Labour\u0027s John McDonnell REFUSES to back down on his claims...Share this articleMeanwhile, cross-party Remainers have tabled amendments designed to bind Mrs May\u0027s hands in the negotiations and force a referendum that could cancel the UK\u0027s departure from the EU altogether. Mr Tusk underlined his tough stance after holding talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels last night.He tweeted: \u0027No news is not always good news.

It was a source that was well known to both Mr. Bezos and Miss Sanchez.\u0027                            They were talking marriage. The three of us had discussed before that, at some point, this was going to be a scandal. My advice was, let’s get to the other side. Our analogy was always that they were landing a 747.

Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him,\u0027 the company said in a statement released on Friday. \u0027Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.\u0027            Cheers: His sister is actually the second person close to Michael whose texts have shown up in The National Enquirer, with Scotty Neal Hughes (above) suffering a similar leakThe American Media board is comprised of four iniduals, including: owner David Pecker Evan Ratner, a partner  at Chatham Asset Management Barry Schwartz, also a partner at at Chatham Asset Management and David R. Hughes, the former executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer of Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc. Chatham Asset Management has an 80 percent stake in American Media according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, it was revealed on Friday that federal prosecutors were reviewing the emails sent by AMI to Bezos in order to determine if the company violated its immunity deal by blackmailing Bezos. Bezos meanwhile said that he believed Saudia Arabia played a role in AMI\u0027s decision last week.\u0027Several days ago, an AMI leader advised us that Mr. Pecker is “apoplectic” about our investigation. For reasons still to be better understood, the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve,\u0027 wrote Bezos in a post on Thursday.\u0027A few days after hearing about Mr. Pecker’s apoplexy, we were approached, verbally at first, with an offer. They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn’t stop our investigation.\u0027When asked if there was any Saudi involvement in the leaking of Bezos\u0027 texts on Friday, the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs Adel Jubeir said \u0027I doubt it,\u0027 and then a short while later said \u0027no.\u0027   “My Only Goal Has Been to Protect Jeff and Lauren”: Michael Sanchez, Suspected Bezos Leaker, Supplies His Own Theory About the Affair, the Enquirer, Some Below-the-Belt Selfies, and “a Legendary Romance” | Vanity Fair"},{"url":null,"title":"Runner says fought mountain lion stepping neck","story":"    Recovering from his ordeal, Travis Kauffman, 31, has come forward as the man who killed a mountain lion that attacked him as he was on a run on February 4 by stepping on its neck and suffocating it to death          Kauffman opened up about the traumatizing animal fight on Thursday during a press conference held by Colorado Parks and Wildlife, North East region          Travis Kauffman (pictured above following the attack), says the lion locked its jaws on his wrist and was clawing his face and arms during the February 4 attack, leaving his with bloody gashes across his nose and cheek          Kauffman pictured above with his girlfriend Annie Bierbouer before speaking about the life-threatening lion attack on ThursdayKauffman, accompanied by his girlfriend Annie Bierbower, spoke on the horrifying experience in a interview with state wildlife officials on Thursday. The experienced runner said he was heading out on a trail at the Horsetooth Mountain Park when the lion appeared and pounced on him.When the creature pinned him down, Kauffman said his \u0027fear response turned into more of a fight response\u0027 and he began to attack the lion. The lion leaped on Kauffman and locked its jaws on his wrists and started clawing his face and arms.\u0027It was going up towards my face so I threw up my hands to kind of block my face, at which point it grabbed onto my hand and wrist and from there it started to claw at my face and neck.

And I was pretty worried about its claws just sinking into my my stomach and groin area,\u0027 Kauffman said to radio show KUNC.\u0027I was able to shift my weight and get a foot on its neck. … I stepped on its neck with my right foot and just slowly after a few minutes I thought I would be getting close and then it would start thrashing again and I had a few more scratches that resulted from those thrashes at that point, and I’d say another couple minutes later it finally stopped moving,\u0027 Kauffman recalled. Kauffman managed to walk away from the animal fight with his life, suffering bloody gashes running along his face and arms.    Injuries: The Colorado Parks and Wildlife shared these pictures of his bloody gashes and lacerations to his face and neck          He said the lion pinned him down at his wrists and started to attack his face and neck          Kauffman also suffered scratches on his legs in the attack and required 20 stitches to recoverHe suffered numerous wounds including lacerations on his nose and cheek and required about 20 stitches to recover.  By Thursday he had largely recovered from his ordeal but still sported a scar across his cheek from the attack. Kauffman said he\u0027s saddened that he killed the animal, but during the attack he wasn\u0027t even sure if it was actually dead. After the animal seemed unresponsive he ran off, worried more predators might be lurking nearby. The whole fight lasted about 10 grueling minutes.\u0027I was on a crazy fear high,\u0027 he said on the fight.  Kauffman ended up running three miles to get out of the park. He found another runner and a park visitor who jogged with him to a trailhead. Once there he was given a ride to the hospital and treated for his injuries. Wildlife officials released a statement saying that Kauffman was very lucky to escape the attack with his life. \u0027We all feel extremely lucky that this attack was made by a young mountain lion on a knowledgeable runner, otherwise we may have been hosting a very different press conference,\u0027 Mark Leslie, a Colorado Parks and Wildlife manager, said as per CBS. \u0027These animals are ambush predators, and are trained to take quick and lethal action whenever possible,\u0027 he added.

She wears size 6-8 clothes.Technically, at 5ft 7in, and weighing just over 8 stone, she is underweight. ‘I’m just in the underweight zone,’ she confirms. ‘But I’ve been this size since I was 18. I never put on weight. I just can’t.’Why? It’s the question at the heart of this quite astonishing series. Why can some people seemingly eat what they like without putting on a pound, while the rest of us only have to look at a KitKat and start ballooning? Why is life so unfair to the rest of us?Mother who snapped famous \u0027Fab Four\u0027 royal photo reveals her...\u0027Worn once by mistake on trial run to a compulsive liar\u0027:...What happened to the stars of Crackerjack? From alcoholism...I could crush a grape! BBC\u0027s children\u0027s classic Crackerjack!...Share this articleGaby signed up to take part in the programme because she wanted the answers too. ‘It’s always just been one of those things. My friends watch me just eat whatever I feel like, and they just get confused about why I’m the size I am. I wanted to find out if there was a “reason”.’The format of the show has the experts piling in. Gaby undergoes a series of tests to determine that she is healthy, and to check that she has no history of eating disorders.Her family are interviewed (her baffled mum reveals that as a baby Gaby was anything but thin. She weighed 11½ pounds at birth).          The 35-year-old landscape garden designer from South London and husband Roy feature in a new Channel 4 programme following people who remain slim despite horrible eating habitsThen cameras are installed in her home — particularly in the kitchen, and by the fridge. When she leaves her home, private investigators go too. For one week, every item she puts in her mouth is recorded, and the calorific content is analysed. Every bit of her (dietary) life comes under scrutiny, even to the point of her poo being sent away for analysis.In Essex, Karl Marley, a 37-year-old car alarm engineer from Braintree, is having his diet similarly examined. Like Gaby, Karl — who has a toddler daughter and another child on the way — has always been thin. He weighs around 9 st, and has never gone above 10 st ‘even when I’ve been really trying to put on weight with protein shakes and the like’. He’s the odd one out in his family.‘They are all slightly larger than average. They just look at me — and the amount I eat — and tut. They say it doesn’t make sense. My sister is a dietician and even she says: “The maths don’t add up here.”‘When I was younger, everyone said that it was because I did a lot of sport, and that I’d just blow up one day when I stopped. But I don’t do sport any more, and I’ve stayed the same size. I’ve worn the same size trousers — 28 in waist — since I stopped growing in my teens.’Karl has a sedentary life now. He spends much of his day in his car, driving to see clients. A camera is put in his car to record what he actually eats en route.          Big appetites: Karl Marley, a 37-year-old car alarm engineer from Essex, weighs 9 stone despite having sugary cereal, two packets of crisps, a fizzy drink, a chocolate bar, a tangerine, an apple, five mini-sausages all before tucking into a ham sandwich for lunchBrace yourselves, because Karl eats, and eats, and eats. Or so it seems. Every day, he has a sugary cereal with milk before he leaves home, but from mid-morning onwards, he starts the lunchtime routine. He has two packets of crisps, a fizzy drink, a chocolate bar, a tangerine, an apple, five mini-sausages. Then he has a ham sandwich for lunch proper.‘It has to be ham,’ he says. ‘When we were filming, the TV people got my partner Bethany to put tomato in it, because they were fascinated by how I always ate the same things, and that was a complete no-no. I hate tomato.’He is an extraordinary creature of habit. ‘I have to have my three meals a day, however much else I have eaten. My wife can skip lunch, or just have a banana, and not think about it. For me, the world would end if I didn’t have my lunch.’The filming process reveals Karl eats exactly the same things every day, in pretty much the same order and his mealtimes run like clockwork — almost to the minute. Once he has had lunch, though, he doesn’t eat again until evening (although he might have another packet of crisps or two).When he goes home to a meal prepared by Bethany. It might be a half pizza, with chips, or a stir fry. Whatever, dinner is most certainly followed by dessert. ‘I always have to have something sweet, even if it’s just an ice-cream bar. What the filming did show up, though, was that I eat with military precision. There’s something even robotic about the way I eat.’          Karl (with his daughter and wife) eats exactly the same things every day, in pretty much the same order and his mealtimes run like clockwork — almost to the minuteWhat on earth to make of these very different — but equally unhealthy, surely —approaches to food? Well, the experts are baffled at first. ‘They just saw me eating junk food, and more junk food,’ admits Karl, but the first surprising revelation comes when the calorie content is worked out, and averaged out over the week.While there are some days that both Gaby and Karl seem to eat their own body weight in food, the average consumption is not quite as high as you’d imagine. Karl averages 2,600 calories a day which — as resident nutritionist Amanda Ursell calculates — is exactly the amount a man of his age and size should be eating.‘But because I was quite rigid in when I ate, there wasn’t any uncontrolled snacking,’ says Karl. ‘I didn’t go mad. I don’t really. Everything happens in a specific time-frame.’Is this significant? Yes, believes Amanda. She wonders if Karl could be inadvertently following a ‘chrono diet’. There is quite a buzz about chronobiology in the nutrition world at the moment.The thinking behind it is that it’s not just what you eat that influences weight and health, but when you eat it. Karl consumes the majority of his calories early in the day — a good thing, we are told. The meticulously regulated nature of his eating, in terms of the clock, could help too.‘I found that fascinating. I’d never even heard of chronobiology before,’ he says. ‘I will now have to test it out by stopping eating my food in the way I do — and see if I turn into a whopper!’What about Gaby and her seemingly endless appetite? Surprisingly, the calorie results are similar. Her meals are much more varied than Karl’s. She may have cereal or toast for breakfast, or pick up a muffin on her way to work. Lunch may be a sausage roll, or a salad grabbed on the hoof. She will tend to wolf down crisps for snacks.Evenings are interesting. Every night, without fail, her husband Roy cooks. He piles her plate with lots of vegetables as well as meat. For every burger she eats, she will have a mountain of fresh vegetables. She loves pickled vegetables. The couple make their own and she will snack on these.When the maths is done, it seems that Gaby is NOT eating an obscene amount. (She’s averaging 2,000 calories a day — again the recommended amount for a woman).There is something rather unusual about Gaby though. Her poo. Samples are sent off to a laboratory in Cork and scientists there make a remarkable discovery. The test they are doing is on gut bacteria, assessing the numbers and types of (good) bacteria present in the digestive system.They discover that Gaby has the most varied range of gut bacteria they have ever seen — ‘the most erse bacteria we have ever seen in the whole of Western Europe,’ says Professor Paul O’Toole.Gaby, who understandably has never given this a thought, is stunned at the news. ‘I feel special,’ she says. What does it mean, though? There is a direct link between gut bacteria — and the speed in which food moves through the system — and obesity.In a nutshell, low levels of gut bacteria are more likely to be associated with obesity. ‘Those are not the levels you would expect to find in an overweight person,’ says Prof O’Toole, of Gaby’s results.‘I can only conclude that because I eat a really varied diet, I get away with the stuff that some people might think “bad”,’ says Gaby. She does have her own theories about why she is still slim. Gaby reckons that her job as a landscape gardener plays a role.‘I’m always outside. There’s a physical aspect — carting big plant pots around — but it’s also usually quite cold. My theory is that I expend so much energy just trying to stay warm that I can eat anything.’There is also something, she reckons, in her vinegar obsession. ‘I’ve always had that. As a child my mum had to take the vinegar off me because I’d try to drink it out of the cap. I can drink salad dressing straight from the bottle.’          Mother-of-two Rinia Rijker, 30, of Surrey, also features in the new show. In less than 24 hours, the 30-year-old was seen tucking into a fast food breakfast, pictured, munching on crisps and enjoying swigs of cola. She later had a takeaway for dinnerSome believe that a daily dose of vinegar can help you lose weight, though this has never been scientifically proven. Few doctors would suggest glugging it straight from the bottle.If there are lessons to be learned from both of these people, though, it seems to be that being relaxed about what you eat might well work to your advantage. Neither has the word ‘diet’ in their vocabulary. Neither frets about what they are putting in their mouths.Neither thinks of any food as ‘bad’ or ‘off-limits’. Neither starves themselves all day, then binges — the thing that horrifies dieticians more than anything (even more than asking for a second burger, it seems). They eat simply when they are hungry.‘I do feel that I have a very pragmatic approach to food,’ says Gaby. ‘I eat when I’m hungry. I’ve never eaten for comfort, to cheer myself up. When I eat I’m not filling a void in some way.’And while she can appear to eat her own weight in burgers, all washed down with loads of vinegar, she can turn down a biscuit.‘I don’t go for sweet things. We can have a packet of biscuits in the house for months and I really won’t be tempted. We still have chocolate left over from Christmas. It might sit there for a year. I honestly won’t be bothered.’Is this the true answer to why some people are sickeningly slim, though? Perhaps it is.Secret Lives Of Slim People is on Channel 4 on Monday at 8.30pm."},{"url":null,"title":"Meet Greta worlds unlikeliest strike leader","story":"    Climate activist Greta Thunberg attend a session of the World Economic Forum in Davos, SwitzerlandA good number of them have been inspired by Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old pig-tailed Swedish schoolgirl who has been obsessively researching climate change for seven years and who, since last summer, has been skipping school every Friday to sit on the steps of the Swedish parliament, the Riksdag, with a home-made sign that reads \u0027Skolstrejk för Klimatet\u0027 (School strike for the climate).She grows her own vegetables, refuses air travel and luxury hotels — even if the only option is a 32-hour train journey and a tent — and with her round face and simple clothes, looks even younger than she is.          Greta\u0027s mother is Swedish opera singer Malena Ernman. She is seen performing during the Eurovision grand final in Moscow on May 16Greta also struck the fear of God into attendees at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland in December 2018, accusing them of leaving the burden of climate change with future generations.\u0027I don\u0027t want your hope. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day,\u0027 she told them firmly in her clear, calm, barely accented English.She gave business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month both barrels, too — \u0027our house is on fire!\u0027 she said, and looked IMF Chairwoman Christine Lagarde very hard in the eye as they shook hands.How brilliant! Regardless of what you think about climate change, for once we have a proper role model who practises what she preaches with dedication and courage.And, of course, had every child that\u0027s going \u0027on strike\u0027 today, as part of the so-called \u0027Fridays for Future\u0027 movement, been inspired and mobilised by Greta, then teachers, heads, parents and politicians alike would probably be more relaxed about them bunking off school to join her protest.But sadly, Greta\u0027s campaign has been hijacked by a band of opportunistic militant anti-Tory career activists who are co-ordinating the walkouts and drumming up support among children on social media in an effort to further their own hard-line agenda, not just on green issues, but also promoting civil disobedience.          Greta Thunberg was born on 3 January 2003. Her father is actor Svante Thunberg, - here with her sister Beata. She is pictured with her other family membersThey include in their hoary ranks Roger Hallam, 52, founder of Extinction Rebellion, whose roadblocks bought parts of London to a standstill in November Janine O\u0027Keeffe, an academic who specialises in \u0027empowerment struggles\u0027 Jake Woodier, a former vegan cafe owner and Robert Possnett, a 57-year-old ex-paratrooper and fanatical Remainer.Little wonder Education Secretary Damian Hinds said yesterday that skipping school \u0027won\u0027t do a thing to help the environment\u0027, while teaching leaders say parents will face £60 fines if their children walk out.So what inspired the girl who\u0027s sparked such a remarkable situation?When Greta was 11, she became depressed and stopped talking and eating.In December, she described herself as having been \u0027diagnosed with Asperger\u0027s syndrome, OCD and selective mutism — \u0027I only speak when I have something important to say\u0027 — and insists her autism helps her concentrate. \u0027I see the world a bit differently, from another perspective… I can do the same thing for hours.\u0027 She comes from an eminent family.Her mother is the beautiful blonde Swedish opera singer Malena Ernman who was the country\u0027s entry in the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest.Her father is actor Svante Thunberg, who was named after a distant relative, Svante Arrhenius, the Nobel-prize-winning scientist who in 1896 first calculated the greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide emissions.(While much of his work has stood the test of time, he did predict that it would take another 2,000 years for us to reach today\u0027s levels of warming.)Greta\u0027s own crusade began when she was nine years old and learned about climate change at school in Sweden — a nation which prides itself on its progressive approach to climate control.\u0027They were always talking about how we should turn off lights, save water, not throw out food,\u0027 she said in one interview.  Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old pig-tailed Swedish schoolgirl, has been obsessively researching climate change for seven yearsBut she couldn\u0027t get her head around the fact that there were potential solutions available, but no action. \u0027If humans could really change the climate, everyone would be talking about it and people wouldn\u0027t be talking about anything else,\u0027 she said. \u0027But this wasn\u0027t happening.\u0027So she started researching climate change herself, and found she couldn\u0027t stop. She became a vegan, stopped buying anything that was not essential and refused to fly anywhere.Her research was so time-consuming she was forced to give up her hobbies — theatre, singing, dancing, music, horse-riding — but she didn\u0027t care.\u0027You have to see the bigger perspective,\u0027 she insisted.Then she began working on her parents. \u0027Some people claim my parents have brainwashed me, but it was the opposite: I brainwashed my parents,\u0027 she said. They quickly fell into line.By 2016, her mother had given up flying — putting an end to her international performing career. The family gave up meat and dairy because of what they regard as the damaging environmental effects of raising animals, installed solar batteries, started growing their own vegetables, went vegan and cycled everywhere, keeping an electric car for emergencies.But Greta was only just starting.In August last year, her private personal protest went public when she walked out of school and plonked herself outside the Riksdag. Her demands were simple — that politicians reduced carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement of 2015.(Her protest chimed with a country struck by heatwaves and wildfires in the hottest summer since records began 262 years before.) And her homemade leaflets, handed out in the shadow of the Riksdag, were to the point: \u0027I\u0027m doing this because you adults are sh****ng on my future,\u0027 they read. She was moved on several times by police, and was reprimanded at home by her parents.But she sat there, alone, for three weeks during school hours, school books in her lap, until after the Swedish general election on September 9, and has been there pretty much every Friday since, in rain, sleet, snow and hail.In November 2018, still aged just 15 and dressed in a blue hoodie and hair in long plaits she gave her first TED talk (the series of talks given by eminent speakers online for a global audience). It has had nearly a million views.Soon her word was spreading across the world.Tens of thousands of Belgian children have played truant from school to march on the streets of Brussels, Namur, Leuven and Liege, inspired by Greta\u0027s simple message. At the World Economic Forum convention in Davos last month, she camped in the snow in temperatures of -18C rather than accept luxury hotel accommodation — and that after enduring a 32-hour train journey with her long-suffering dad.\u0027I want to practise what I preach,\u0027 she said, in one simple sentence shaming her fellow Davos eco-campaigners, who descended on the Swiss resort in more than 1,500 private jets and helicopters.  Students gather to demand the government take action on climate change at Martin Place on November 30 last year          Greta  holds a placard next to students during a \u0027strike for climate\u0027 held on the sidelines of the World Economic ForumAnd despite looking more like Pippi Longstocking than a global climate activist, she wasn\u0027t remotely fazed either by her fellow panellists (who included Bono, primatologist Jane Goodall and singer Will.i.am), or her audience of some of the world\u0027s richest and most powerful people.\u0027Someone is to blame,\u0027 she said. \u0027Some people. Some companies, some decision-makers in particular have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money,\u0027 she said. \u0027And I think many of you here today belong to that group.\u0027Unlike so many politically motivated campaigners, Greta has never wavered.\u0027I am doing this because nobody else is doing anything it is my moral responsibility to do what I can,\u0027 she said.Today, of course, she is no longer protesting alone, sitting bravely in the snow, clasping that damp banner to her chest.No wonder so many kids were inspired by her. And no wonder school strikes have also been held in Germany, Switzerland, Australia and even Uganda.But what a shame that her cause has been embraced, piggybacked, hijacked even, by a worrying number of militant activists in this country, desperate to politicise her campaign for their own selfish ends."},{"url":null,"title":"Schoolboy uses pocket money buy rose girl year Valentines Day","story":" Callum Drew, eight, spent his own hard-earned pocket money on silk roses for every girl in his school yearWhile kids his age would usually spend their money on sweets or toys, the eight-year-old bought every girl a silk rose, which last forever, as he doesn\u0027t want any girl to feel bad about herself.\u0027I just wanted to get some flowers for the girls in year four as I don\u0027t want them to feel let down on Valentine\u0027s Day,\u0027 he said.\u0027I will go around every class and give them their present.It\u0027s a HOT Valentine\u0027s Day!

It is where chief executives fly to in private jets to discuss the dire consequences of climate change, where hot-money speculators deliver homilies on responsible investing, and the world’s media receive every falling cliche with unctuous warmth. Yet last month it was here in Switzerland, amid the sharp shooters and roadblocks, that a very revealing skirmish broke out.Were I Anand Giridharadas’s publisher, I would broadcast that exchange as an advertisement for his latest book, in which he takes aim at his favourite targets. The elevation of business people to “leaders”, whose views somehow soar above self-interest the nose-wrinkling dismissal of messy politics the blimpish disregard for even recent history – all are present and shown as incorrect in Winners Take All.The big questions animating this book are the ones central to western politics today: why is the state of affairs made nonsense by the economic crisis still in place? What explains both the governing class’s lack of serious response to 2008’s banking crash, and the vast inequality that continues in its wake? Rather than economic or political analysis, Winners Take All is a study of the alibis and strategies used by Dell and his kind to justify inertia. Giridharadas takes us inside charitable foundations and back-slapping summits to meet management consultants, greying politicians and a few of the most important names in philanthropy. His is the view from the panel discussion, the venture capitalist’s boardroom and the fundraiser with its bespoke canapes.As reporting assignments go, this calls not so much for a flak jacket as a sick bag. In a Manhattan crammed with visiting dignitaries for UN week, Bill Clinton convenes a conference at which the audience is told: “Empowering girls and women is the hot new branding thing!” David Miliband gazes on as the boss of Western Union chides the prime minister of Sweden: “One of the issues in the politicians, with all due respect, Mr Prime Minister, is that you guys are voted by local people, but you’re responsible for global issues.” Never mind that Mr Western Union is beholden to his shareholders, it’s the nation state that’s parochial.Giridharadas boards a cruise ship bound for the Bahamas, doubling as a floating conference for entrepreneurs apparently hungry for social justice. Into this arena is beamed Edward Snowden, whose exposing of the US’s surveillance regime led to his exile in Moscow. He talks to the assembled cruisers about the necessity of heretical thinking, before the Silicon Valley moneyman interviewing him breaks in: “So I invest in founders for a living. And I gotta tell you … I smell a founder here … there’s probably investors waiting for you here.”Witnessing such hubris and hypocrisy must have been hard on the stomach it does, however, make superb hate-reading. Through these vignettes, Giridharadas depicts an elite he dubs MarketWorld, an international nexus of consultants and business people and centrist politicians who want “to change the world while also profiting from the status quo”. Its hubs include Silicon Valley and Wall Street, its feeding stations Davos and all the other expensive talking shops. Its denizens have access to political power and millions to buy wider influence, through donating to universities and museums. In his bemused defensiveness over higher taxes, Dell was the embodiment of MarketWorld. The billionaires in this book prefer markets to governments, policies to politics, and love solutions that are win-win – which is another way of saying that they should never lose. Theirs is conservatism camouflaged in radical adjectives change you can’t believe in.In this exotic land, Giridharadas is an insider-outsider. Having spent half a chapter beating up McKinsey management consultants, he later reveals that he worked there. Pages are spent laying into TED talks, even though the author has delivered two. His wife is Priya Parker, who describes her business as helping “activists, elected officials, corporate executives, educators, and philanthropists create transformative gatherings” of precisely the kind her husband skewers in this book. As for networking, Giridharadas admits to mingling with “the ultra-rich in antler-decorated mansions overlooking the Roaring Fork Valley”. Fair enough: a man’s got to eat – and he might as well eat devilled eggs.That background allows him precious access and imbues the text with a catty intimacy that is hugely enjoyable. His one-liners and storytelling zest make Giridharadas the guy who you want to hang out with on the sidelines of that earnest cocktail party. But his analysis could do with some deepening. The ugly vanity of MarketWorld may be eye-catching, but what makes it unfair is that it is bankrolled by the rest of us, through lower wages and low taxes on wealth. Simply put, we pay the billionaires to tell us what to do. What gives their demands such amplification isn’t just their money, vital though that is, it is that they and their friends in government have razed many of the countervailing institutions, whether organised labour or local government. Winners Take All doesn’t name it, but what it’s really describing is an institutional crisis in which the political landscape has been cleared of its forces for representation and reformation. Instead, power has been put in the hands of a group that believes trade unions are merely cartels, thinkers are far inferior to “thought leaders” and hell is other people voting.Giridharadas’s answer to all this is simple: a bigger and more powerful state. “The government is us,” he quotes Italian philosopher Chiara Cordelli approvingly. And he is right that it is high time politics took back the ground it has lost to policy. But barely more than a line is spent acknowledging that there are plenty of times the government is not us – when it is taking away our benefits, when it is displacing us from our homes, or when it is cutting taxes for corporations while closing children’s centres.Arguments aside, this is a good book whose most subtle and powerful moments come when Giridharadas finds other insiders with a hankering to be on the outside, agents of change who know that the system they work within only shortchanges us. People such as Darren Walker, the sharp-minded African American head of the Ford Foundation charity, who knows the root problem goes deeper than poverty and bad luck it is inequality. Riding his black limousine into “the belly of the beast”, a private equity firm, Walker plans how he will broach that argument, but finds himself in front of an impassive audience and resorts to a familiar vaudeville act of telling his harsh life story: born in a hospital run by a charity, raised single-handedly by his mum, working as a busboy aged 12 … The executives respond by asking how he motivates staff.In this way, banal humiliation is heaped on a good and relatively powerful man trying to reform a system that, on all the available evidence, may not be reformable.• Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World is published by Allen Lane (£12.99).

On this week’s books podcast, the ’s resident thriller fan Alison Flood struggled to finish The Flower Girls, a new thriller by Alice Clark-Platts, the plot of which contains similarities to the James Bulger murder case. This sparked a discussion on the books desk about the books that have most disturbed us: commissioning editor Richard Lea had nightmares after reading Colson Whitehead’s zombie novel Zone One I once had someone hide my copy of American Psycho so I’d stop dwelling on it and associate culture editor Claire Armitstead once destroyed a copy of Naked Lunch by William Burroughs, because she was so disturbed by a particular scene: “I put it in the fire! I have never destroyed another book … but I didn’t want anyone else to read what I’ve read.”On Twitter, readers shared the books that have most disturbed them: Hanya Yanagihara’s A Little Life was a common choice, as was John Fowles’s The Collector and VC Andrews’s Flowers in the Attic. (Which, as one user tweeted, everyone seems to read far too young.) Others included:Commonly, readers reported having to physically distance themselves from the book itself:What books have most unsettled, shocked or disturbed you, and why? What did you do to cope – did you stop reading the book, hide it or even destroy it?

Even sitting by the engines at takeoff, you didn’t need to raise your voice on the A380 superjumbo. The quiet was almost eerie.It was a monstrous double-decker so big it felt like travelling in two planes stuck on top of one other. It was a kind of cruise ship of the skies with staircases, bars and private first-class cabins, spilling out a wave passengers when it landed at airports. And yet, when you were onboard, it somehow managed to feel delicate.When I took the first public flight on the Airbus A380 in Toulouse in 2007, I remember staring out of the window over the Pyrenees, thinking something was odd. It was the lighting. It felt less like being in a plane than in a strange kind of conference centre. The windows were bigger, letting in more natural light, and there were special light systems to alter cabin mood.For that two-hour flight over south-west France – the first time the media had been able to film inside the most complex passenger plane ever built – I watched company bosses and journalists stretching their legs by nipping up and down the staircases linking the two decks than ran the entire length of the plane. Flight attendants said they were glad to have larger floor space in which to work. There was more height above your head and it felt airy.It was also smooth. Air turbulence and movement didn’t seem to register. It almost felt as if you were standing on solid ground while being in the air. In surveys, passengers would later approve of it, praising its quiet, comfort and spaciousness.Technologically it was a success, even though economically it failed to get off the ground."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4af4cc84ca81e178320b1363aef9b7a527e3002f/0_0_4155_2493/master/4155.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b674b79cbdb25a0a0a16b4d89c3dd742","title":"cat ladders a creative solution for felines in flats in pictures","story":"Strategically placed ramps and ladders for urban cats are all the rage in Bern.

The trillion dollar corporation had lined up the support of the mayor of New York City, the governor of New York, and began hiring the fleet of well-compensated lobbyists and strategists necessary to see its vision through.It was a typical American story: a corporation with unfathomable wealth getting exactly what it wanted. Amazon would promise 25,000 jobs, many of them supposedly well-paying, and get its gleaming second headquarters, along with a buffet of tax breaks that added up to $3bn, generous subsidies it never really needed but sure wanted.On Thursday, that all changed. After unrelenting pressure from politicians and an energized grassroots movement that drove these politicians to act, Amazon has said no more. The company is walking away from New York. It’s taking its ball and going home.This is not just about New York now. Amazon’s retreat may represent a turning point in the way cities do business—or think they can do business in this age of income inequality and precarity. Amazon is one of five corporations that utterly dominate the economy, deciding how we shop, what prices we pay, and what leverage most businesses can or can’t have.Amazon has eviscerated brick-and-mortar retailers, broken countless unionization efforts, offered its facial recognition technology to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and, for anyone who cares about the written word, tried to crush the publishing industry. Amazon’s surrender is a warning to all Democrats who want to occupy the progressive flank from here on out: you don’t get to support a company like this anymore.Amazon’s defeat was a direct product of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s election, which was waged in a neighboring district. Younger, progressive residents joined forces with groups like the Democratic Socialists of America to mobilize against Amazon and pressure more moderate Democrats to quickly close ranks against the corporate titan. They did.The weather has now changed. You don’t get to champion unions out of one side of your mouth and praise a company that loathes them with the other. You don’t get to bemoan economic exploitation and welcome a corporation that thrives on it. You don’t get to say on the stump you support small businesses, fair play, and good government while embracing a company that negotiates in secret, tries to circumvent the democratic process, and undercuts as many competitors as it can.Amazon is a monopoly, a product of this new and twisted Gilded Age. Like Apple, it flourishes on an exploited, low-wage workforce that is mostly invisible to the average American. Like Google and Facebook, its market share is unrivaled. There is no competing with Amazon. It will swallow you whole before you try.The national competition for the second Amazon headquarters, or HQ2, in 2017 represented a certain economic nadir for the country. Dozens of municipalities battled against one another in a race to the bottom, offering absurd tax breaks in the hopes that Amazon would deem them worthy. An HQ, unlike a warehouse, needs a more educated workforce, so New York was always a logical destination.American cities have long, regrettable histories of subsidizing highly profitable corporations and entities that don’t need such breaks. Precious dollars for roads, schools, and housing are denied in taxes that are never paid. In turn, municipalities are just supposed to be grateful for this welfare, praying daily the corporation doesn’t deign to pack its bags and go elsewhere.Too many politicians have been complicit in this game, Democrats especially. While Amazon will continue to poll “well”—Americans prize cheap and convenient consumption—politicians, especially those running for president, should not use this as an excuse to defend Amazon or look the other way. The “pro-business” Democrat is the anti-worker Democrat—at least in the era we live in now.The only businesses that really matter are these mega-corporations, and most of them find democracy inconvenient. If they can obliterate the remnants of organized labor in this country, they will.Since Donald Trump, beyond sliming Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for running the Washington Post, has no serious interest in breaking up corporate monopolies, it will fall to the next Democratic president to do so. All of the contenders, like Elizabeth Warren, must articulate clear anti-trust platforms and speak forcefully on behalf of the American worker.Amazon must become a defining issue of this campaign, because it’s not going anywhere. Bezos will hunt for his tax breaks elsewhere. He will continue to accumulate wealth. Candidates must shun his business and say why. Then, and only then, will we exit this neo-Gilded Age for something better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c8b797a16db9f319d4c2215df79d7fbcb64b989/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75dfd66a35ddc7b3ca298e584bf0ce48","title":"may reckless no deal brexit","story":"Just another Brexit day of dither, delay and dawdling. Just another humiliating defeat for Theresa May at the hands of the party within her party that she dare not confront. Clever Anna Soubry won a significant victory: the Conservative MP forced the government to agree to publish its no-deal advice – we shall now know what the cabinet knows. We shall see the full horror of the damage a no-deal Brexit would do to business and trade. Those who brought us to this pitch should remember that a day of judgment will come. Someday a judicial inquiry will expose the reckless Brexit chaos into which the Conservative party cast this country. Inquiries go on for years, but in the end a mighty Domesday tome will record what was done, by whom and why. If anyone in Labour aided and abetted Brexit, they too will be recorded in the annals.The civil service knows: observers note the scrupulous care with which officials insist ministers personally sign every decision, delay or absurdity they are ordered to carry out. They know someday the recording angels will write down the names of everyone to blame.For this reason, the government’s caving in to Soubry and Labour MP Chuka Umunna’s demand to see the evidence was vital – no need to wait for opening the archives in 30 years’ time. Expect yet more hair-raising documents. We already know about stockpiled body bags, the military call-up to quell food riots, and escape plans for the Queen. Can it get much worse? We need granular details of inadequate logistics and exactly which medicines and isotopes might not reach which mortally ill people, and who may need those body bags.Reading it, we can consider how each face round that cabinet table seriously accepted all this without raising a finger to halt it yet. Presumably they are neither certifiable nor agents of Vladimir Putin, so they must know they can never let this happen – even Liam Fox. But everyone waits for someone else to pull the emergency cord first. Now the day for them to resign and speak out is set for 27 February – or will they flinch again? May aims to wait until the last days of March as the train approaches that broken bridge before she stops just in time. Her no-deal threat was always a sham.That’s criminally reckless, and her feint comes at gigantic cost. The recording angels will write the billions lost into their account books. Fear of no deal has sent banks and companies fleeing across the Channel or to Dublin – the Dutch and French are gloating at the cash inflow. Had May honestly ruled out no deal from the start, many would have stayed. The money squandered goes far beyond the Treasury’s £4.2bn already burned for a nonevent. The Bank of England governor points to zero investment growth since the referendum, the UK “dramatically underperforming both history and peers”. Thousands of civil servants are hired, thousands more switched, denuding other departments fridges, warehouses and staff are rented at market-busting rates. Add in the uncounted loss to business. The UK’s reputational damage is unfathomable: cracks in the union warn of a little England left alone. Even if we leave the EU with some spatchcocked deal, how was it clever to advertise to the world that this country took leave of its senses?But in parliament the charade played on. The European Research Group (ERG) fulminated against the motion that simply noted what parliament voted for last month – fairytale “alternative arrangements” for the Irish border and Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey’s block on no deal. As ever, in this deadlocked, logjammed debate, the government kowtowed to the ERG and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, hardened his stance, vowing no deal was still on the table. Result? The ERG still refused to back her, while Spelman denounced this as “contemptuous” of parliament. And so it was.The ERG is unappeasable. It pretends no deal is a vital “bargaining chip” the EU sighs at the absurdity. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, made elegant mincemeat of the idea that no deal is a credible negotiating position. Dominic Grieve said it was a like a three-year-old holding its breath to get its way. But this is not about “leverage”: the ERG wants no deal. Working themselves into a froth of wrath, the likes of Mark Francois will never vote for anything less.Delay as she might, Tory Armageddon day will come whenever the ERG demands no deal and May finally refuses. Delaying article 50 is now surely inevitable: Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin’s plan will almost certainly win parliament the right to demand a delay on 27 February, preventing no deal. The Brussels eavesdrop on May’s civil servant Olly Robbins, plus well-informed insight from her old adviser Nick Timothy, reveals she will offer two choices: her deal or a long delay. Surely they who know her are right: she is not the type of thrill-seeker to relish being in charge on no-deal Brexit day.The showdown with her party-within-a party will come, so why not face them down now? She could save some credibility, after all her humiliations. Tell them the home truths she sees daily in cabinet documents we shall now read: this is no Project Fear.In the real world, the tearing of hair among businesses trying to mitigate unknowable risks grows louder every day. Ian Wright, the head of the food and drinks federation, lets rip on behalf of his members: “Do these politicians think they’ll get away with blaming this on the EU when the day comes? When prices rise, shelves are emptying, the great British public will know who’s to blame.” He talks of companies that long ago ordered shipments of sugar and other faraway goods, with no idea if tariffs will be sky-high or zero when they arrive after 29 March. If zero, much of British food, farming and agriculture will collapse under cheap imports if on WTO rules, they face hefty tariffs on processed food, cereals and meat.Latest on his desk: what to do about packaging printed “Made in the EU”? No one in Whitehall can tell them how packs should be marked. Wright says most of his companies “aren’t the sort who think much about politics. But they do now.” He is incandescent. If Brexit fallout propels politicians out of politics, he warns: “If they think they can sail into jobs in business, they can think again. No company will employ them. In interviews they’ll be asked about Brexit: ‘What did you do in the great war, Daddy?’” He says one in eight of his members fear they will go to the wall in a no-deal Brexit, so he speaks with their authentic outrage.Boris Johnson’s “fuck business” said it all. Some day, those recording angels will have the names and count the losses. Thanks to Soubry, we shall soon know what the cabinet knows."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa51401ba97e6e1111d3adc5150c8defe232dc28/0_131_4850_2910/master/4850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee31d35ad7476de8a19371e1a0b093a0","title":"shamima begum grooming islamic state pregnant uk","story":"Four years after joining Islamic State in Syria, she is now 19 and pregnant. She should be allowed back to the UKIt’s impossible not to feel a jolt of shock when confronted with the photo of Shamima Begum on the front page of this morning’s Times. Four years ago – when we last saw her – it was accepted that Begum had been brainwashed. There was consensus that she was an innocent child who’d been groomed online. Begum was allowed to be the victim in the nation’s narrative – one that over decades had grasped the power and dangers of grooming – because that demanded nothing from us. She was the little girl who’d been caught up in a dangerous death cult the pixelated image of a kid caught on CCTV about to fly, and that was sad.It was also made easier by her absence. We only needed to empathise with Begum’s situation in the abstract. Of course, we wanted her to be rescued and returned to Britain immediately. But that was just a fantasy. I can’t have been alone in assuming these girls would simply meet a horrible fate in the fighting abroad. Having been found alive and nine months pregnant in a Syrian refugee camp, Begum is no longer an abstract concept. Instinctively it feels a little harder to say we should bring her back to her home in the United Kingdom – especially given her apparent lack of remorse. And yet is she not still a victim of grooming? Still a British citizen we should be looking to help? There are already those arguing that since Begum left the UK to join Islamic State four years ago her situation has changed entirely. Ex counter-terrorism chief Mark Rowley told the Today programme on Radio 4 this morning that when Begum was 15 he considered her a victim. Now she is an adult what happens next, he argued, should be determined by clinical risk assessment and the consideration of cold, hard facts. He wants us to separate those grainy images of a young girl from the crisp picture of the woman she is today.But to see Begum in isolation to past events serves no purpose. The brainwashed child she was has everything to do with the brainwashed young woman she has become. That’s not to justify what she has done, but to see the series of events that have unfolded in her life as being traceable directly back to her grooming and subsequent radicalisation. Children are influenced by those around them, a product of their environment. We only develop and learn to be better when another influence takes a bad one’s place. Since the age of 15 Begum has not been afforded that opportunity in the caliphate it is unsurprising her views continue to be as dangerous as when she left – they’ve become her norm.If she seems untroubled by the violence she has witnessed, that’s no more a sign of a callous and wicked villain than a vulnerable young woman who is profoundly scarred. We know that trauma in childhood impacts your experiences as you grow older. I can’t begin to imagine what she has seen in her life, what it’s like to have had two children die. What we told ourselves about that 15-year-old girl remains true to this day, except now helping this young woman requires more than just easy words.That’s not to say Begum is to receive a hero’s welcome back at Gatwick airport. To rehabilitate and reintegrate her back into society will take much work by dedicated professionals, be in no doubt. But to try to help her must be better than leaving this teenager to languish in a camp, to quite possibly witness her third child die. If rehabilitation proves impossible, at least back in Britain she can live under supervision and be kept from doing further harm – to herself or to others. And should, one day soon, Begum be in a position to rejoin British society proper, who could be better placed to warn other vulnerable children of the dangerous reality of online grooming, of radicalisation by extremists and the acts that led her to commit? Our justice system is based on the possibility of rehabilitation. It would be wrong to write off the prospect of anyone changing, let alone a vulnerable 19-year-old girl and her unborn child.• Michael Segalov is a contributing editor at Huck magazine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ffee2c6c4810d9ea9da637d430164641fed7ffd/0_0_4996_2998/master/4996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12964e92866c323cee16cbfee2ab2ea5","title":"im sorry you had to do that mum learning what my airbnb guests got up to","story":"Why did I have to taint this piece of rural paradise with these weird, horny guests?Last year I was only home for about 70 nights. I travelled a lot and, when I was away, rented my house out on Airbnb.So, during the summer, on one of my rare nights home, I decided to host a small party for my neighbours to thank them for putting my bins out, and keeping an eye on the place. But also I wanted to get to know them.It was a hot, stormy evening and we set up the party under the carport. The evening started innocuously enough – then, one bottle of prosecco down, the neighbour who lived in the house behind mine said: “I hope you don’t mind, but you had some guests recently that were a bit strange.”My heart sank. My Airbnb guests. Randoms from the internet. What had they done?“I don’t usually look out my window into your backyard,” she said, by way of caveat. “But I glanced down and something caught my eye.”My neighbour, a retired teacher, tried to be polite as possible but it was obvious what she had seen was my guests having sex, in my backyard, in the middle of the day.I looked out, past the carport, to my backyard – it was a horrible sight.There was a rusty clothes line, dried grass, weeds and thistles. It was ugly, not to mention uncomfortable.“What did they do?” I asked, appalled. “No, wait, don’t tell me what they did!”Ronald, a man in his 80s who lives around the corner, started waving his arms around. “Them! Them! I saw your backyard when I was bringing your bins in!”The whole party joined in – talking about them.“They were really going for it. In the backyard. He was really old and she was really young. I thought it was your brother,” said Ronald.My brother is not old. Also, he did not have sex in my backyard.“It wasn’t my brother,” I said. “It was my Airbnb guests. I’m so sorry!!!”My mother, who was also at the party, was doing a calculation in her head. “Was this around a month ago?”“I came to the house on the Monday, after they had been here and had to strip the beds. And … ”– everyone leaned in at this fresh horror – “I found a pair of undies!”My neighbours squealed. Mum mimed the movement you make when you pick a dirty pair of undies up with a stick.“Eugh!” said all the neighbours. “Undies!”My mother then mimed hurling the undies into a distant field – similar to someone throwing a javelin.“I’m sorry you had to do that, Mum,” I said.My neighbours were such innocents. Why did I have to taint this piece of rural paradise with these weird, horny guests?“It’s OK,” said my neighbour, who had seen the sex acts.“Worse thing have happened here,” said Ronald.I looked around. All my neighbours were nodding.Ronald pointed to where I had placed the cheeseboard. “A person who lived here was shot, by police, right where we are now.”“In the garage?”Ronald pointed at the cheese.All the neighbours were explaining it at once, but it made no sense. A previous owner who liked “staying up all night on the internet” came under police suspicion. Police came up to the house in the middle of night, and hearing a strange noise, the man came out carrying a baseball bat.He was confronted by police – who shot him.The entire scenario confused me. “That makes no sense – I am on the internet at night, it’s not suspicious … Did he die?”But the conversation had moved on. Ronald was telling my neighbours that before they had moved into their house, a murderer lived there, and had gone to jail for killing someone and shoving their body down a disused mine shaft.Then those neighbours said to me that actually they didn’t mind that I was away so much – the house was quiet, because previously the tenants were “on drugs and listened to loud music day and night”.“What sort of music?”“Heavy metal.” The police were also frequent visitors to that set of tenants.We were working our way through the cheese and a second bottle of wine. The neighbours were happy and laughing. They were having so much fun – it was so great to get to know each other.But now I knew so much more about my neighbourhood. Too much. The carport, previously a place I hadn’t given much thought to – a neutral space – was the site of great violence. In my mind’s eye I saw the glow of the computer screen (“He was up all night on the internet”) the dark shape of the baseball bat (who has a baseball bat, anyway?) and heard the shot ring out.How could I continue to live here?The storm came in properly now. There was lightning and rain sheeted into the carport. Packing up and bringing things into the house, I stood at the threshold and felt the weight of all that had come before.The neighbours came in, the house had been recently renovated. It was clean and bright.“Oh it looks lovely, the new reno,” said one. “It’s like a different house!”• Brigid Delaney is a columnist for  Australia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4722d4e1c1c9f40950f701fa7df271007b5bd737/0_0_941_575/master/941.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24656a9fe3e0e3cbbcf763c0c24e4168","title":"samantha bee fox news green new deal","story":"Late-night hosts are worn out from another round of Fox News panic and Trump’s reaction to the budget billLate-night hosts discussed the Green New Deal, Fox News and the bill to avert another government shutdown.It has been a week since a few members of Congress, fronted by star congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, introduced the Green New Deal, and the plan to fight climate change has left many Republicans apoplectic. With lines such as “Hide your cows, hide your travel plans”, the loudest criticism has aired on Fox News, “where you can always count on thoughtful analysis based on solid scientific thinking”, said Samantha Bee. For instance, she pointed to a viral clip of a Fox \u0026amp Friends anchor admitting that he hadn’t washed his hands in 10 years, because “germs are not a real thing. I can’t see them, therefore they’re not real”.“The people at Fox should really be worried about working with patient zero here,” said Bee. Instead, they’re “soiling themselves over the Green New Deal”.Bee admitted that many of the ambitious Green New Deal’s proposals – including an overhaul of America’s transportation system, free higher education and a goal of net-zero emissions – will never pass, “but the plan’s aggressive, even radical goals are bringing much-needed attention to climate change”.Furthermore, she argued, it’s not crazy to use the government to do something big and seemingly ridiculous. She pointed to John F Kennedy’s pledge in 1961 to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. “It sounded crazy but we dedicated our fullest resources to it, and our hard work paid off eight years later when we managed to convincingly fake the moon landing,” she said, referring to a widespread (and false) conspiracy theory.But in all seriousness, Bee said, “if we don’t act soon to keep our planet livable, we’ll have to figure out a way to send all 8 billion of us to the actual moon”.Seth Meyers also took a serious look at Fox News on Late Night, turning to Donald Trump’s appearance with Fox host Laura Ingraham on Tuesday. The president told Ingraham that he didn’t yet have an opinion on the bipartisan budget deal because, scheduling-wise, “it was between the deal and you, and I had to choose you”.To be clear, Meyers explained: “He literally said: ‘I had a choice between running the government and going on Fox News and I chose Fox News.’ No quote has ever summed up Trump’s presidency better than that.”As for talking about the deal’s specifics, Trump had, as usual, “all the specificity of a Real Housewives promo”, Meyers said.Meyers then dispensed with the jokes. “Every few months we have to go through this exhausting ritual where we pretend the president actually knows what he’s talking about even though it’s clear he doesn’t,” he said. It’s pointless to argue with someone who can’t agree on shared conditions of reality, he continued. “Trump spends all day digesting lies from Fox News, and Fox News in turn reinforces his alternate reality.”The ridiculous dysfunction of American government seemed to even wear out Stephen Colbert, who kicked off Wednesday’s Late Show with a profuse thank you to his audience and a period of reflection on what, exactly, the point of all this is. The show usually helps him process the day’s news and “think about what it means”, which made Wednesday “tough because the one thing everyone is talking about” – whether or not Trump would sign a budget deal to keep the government open – “doesn’t mean anything”.No significant legislation has passed recently, Colbert noted – no infrastructure bill, or immigration bill, or a fix for skyrocketing healthcare costs. And yet, “we’re celebrating, or supposed to be celebrating, that they’re close to a deal to achieve the absolute minimum: having a government”, Colbert said.“That is like celebrating that you’re child finally used the potty on his first day of medical school.”Instead we have an executive branch of kabuki theatre in which Trump doubts he will sign the necessary budget bill while aides quietly reassure that he will after making “the dance to get to yes”, according to a report.At least, Colbert noted, such a dance is a “refreshing change from Trump’s usual MO: the grope to get past ‘no’”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/363479e1f60acb4d367c02f9cc4225c7433579ae/0_74_4841_2904/master/4841.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=259fbdb45237101060f1a4be4b17ba85","title":"i love calling out politicians xiuhtezcatl martinez on the teenage stand against climate change","story":"Eighteen-year-old activist Xiuhtezcatl Martinez is among those suing the Trump administration for climate inaction. Now he’s asking more students to get involved by joining the school strikesUniversity students should support “badass” teenagers who skip school to strike for climate action by walking out of lectures alongside them, a leading youth activist has said. In recent months more than 20,000 children have skipped school across Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and Australia, demanding governments and politicians do more to limit the effects of global warming. There are more strikes planned in the coming months.Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, 18, global youth director of Earth s, and one of 21 young people suing the Trump administration for failing to combat climate change, says his peers are now at the “head of the table” when it comes to climate activism and that more of them should take part in walkouts.So far, school children have taken a lead on strikes, but the first UK-wide strike on Friday asks young people of all ages to take part.“It would be pretty cool if uni students walk out in solidarity with Greta,” Martinez says, referring to Greta Thunberg, the Swedish 16-year-old who sparked the strikes when she refused to go to school. “If a worldwide movement can do that, it would be crazy.”Martinez is from Boulder, Colorado and of indigenous heritage. He has been campaigning for environmental justice since he was six and regularly speaks on campuses across America. He’s addressed world leaders at the United Nations (UN) and given TED talks on the topic. He’s also a hip-hop artist, using music to promote his activism, and has recently written songs with Jaden Smith, another vocal activist for the climate. “I see this movement is more global, more connected, more erse, younger, and more intergenerational than ever before,” he says. “We’re one of the last generations that will have the chance to lead the way on this.”The next 10 years are crucial we have just over a decade to limit a climate change catastrophe, a landmark report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned in October. Meanwhile scientists say we’re in the middle of what is likely to be the warmest 10 years since records began in 1850.Martinez reckons his generation “thinks differently”, having grown up in a changing, turbulent world. “We have a greater understanding of technology because we grew up with it.” Plus there’s now a strong sense of urgency to act before it’s “too late”.A descendent of Meshika or Aztec people, he says he grew up with an appreciation of nature and the environment. “My dad taught me everything we do is in honour of our ancestors,” he says. Martinez was homeschooled until he was 10, and as a result learned “ancient poems and prayers” while “other kids were learning nursery rhymes”.But he’s not lacking in confidence. “I love calling out politicians,” he says. He and the 21 other young activists aged between 11 and 22 are “turning to the courts” as a “powerful force” where politicians have failed, suing the US federal government over climate change.This week Donald Trump, who has previously said global warming is a hoax invented by China to attack US manufacturing, failed to address the issue in his State of the Union address. Since becoming president, he has also withdrawn the US from the Paris climate agreement, in effect ensuring the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases quit the international effort to address global warming.With powerful enemies, Martinez sometimes feels the pressure. “There have been moments when I’ve just wanted to go to high school and be a normal kid,” he says. It’s not just politicians he’s up against. “It’s some of the biggest industries in the world, from the pharmaceutical industry, to the agriculture industry, to the prison industrial complex to the fossil fuel industry, and we might lose.”That’s why young people must stand together and continue to demand politicians pay attention, whether through strikes, legal action or “however it is you connect with the world”. Students should push for universities to est from fossil fuels and should join school strikers. “Greta Thunberg is a real badass, and now university students have to step up too. Not everyone is outspoken, but we all have a significant part to play,” he says. “So channel your fear, channel your hurt and channel your hatred into action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e0791abd4dfc3836cc8d96304a6fa2e16f2067/0_37_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45333e55e8532c3a116d1b10d4a030bd","title":"tell us about the outfit you loved wearing the most","story":"We’d like you to send in photos of your favourite ‘look’ and share your memories of when you wore itThe clothes we choose to wear can impact our mood, and leave a lasting impression on our memories.

Or what are they even trying to become? These questions cut raggedly through the cold air as Unai Emery’s strange team toiled against Belarusian opponents who have been on a winter break and not played a competitive match for nine weeks.Bate Borisov still more than nullified the best this flawed Arsenal incarnation could offer and inflicted a defeat that was more worrying in its style than its result.There is a chance to overturn this result next week and Emery clung to that at the end of a chastening night. “We play another 90 minutes next week and I’m sure it’s going to be different. Our big chance, big challenge, is next week,” he said. “I trust in our players and in our stadium with our supporters.”In a competition in which Emery has a personal history of triumph and that he is desperate to win for the dual prize of a trophy and the ticket back into Champions League, Arsenal suffered a defeat with no redeeming features. Low on creativity, high on the kind of sudden defensive lapses that cried out to be exploited for an enterprising opponent, their excursion ended with an extra blow as Alexandre Lacazette was sent off for catching Aleksandar Filipovic with a retaliatory elbow. Emery described that as “bad news” and expressed “the need to control frustration”.It speaks volumes for the scale of change since Arsenal visited the Borisov Arena in last season’s Europa League that out of the 18-man squad who came during Arsène Wenger’s final campaign only four travelled this time. Most of last season’s headline players here – Olivier Giroud, Theo Walcott and Jack Wilshere – feel part of a different era.The really complicated bit is that last year’s crop, who won 4-2 here, were unmistakably the B team, players who were struggling to get into Arsenal’s Premier League selection. This was Emery’s selection more or less at full strength, barring injuries and illness, and they found the going extremely heavy. Shaping a new Arsenal identity is not a particularly simple task in a squad who still have a transitional feel. Alex Iwobi and Sead Kolasinac were the pick of the bunch for Arsenal but overall they lacked precision and direction in too many departments.In a place famous for its tractor factory the pitch looked as if it might have been mown by one. Emery insisted the conditions would never be considered an excuse and his team started with a flash of speed and focus, working the goalkeeper in the second minute. Iwobi and Kolasinac combined to set up Henrikh Mkhitaryan, whose shot was smothered by Denis Scherbitski. Little did they know that was about as good as it was going to get.If it gave a first impression Bate were not in the best possible shape that was soon shattered as they began to run with energetic intent at Arsenal’s defensive weak spots. The bubbly Maksim Skavysh enjoyed the freedom to drive forwards at a variety of angles and put pressure on the visitors, and the new signing Nemanja Milic was a handful.Arsenal struggled for a foothold, not able to control the midfield area against opponents who had the old maverick Alex Hleb ambling around like an elegant yet elderly deer. The 37-year-old had postponed his retirement for this tie, a sentimental decision for sure, but his teammates enthusiasm around him made it feel worthwhile and his soft foot shuffle was still in tune after all these years.Just before the break Arsenal’s defence was punctured and for a moment it felt like this little spaceship stadium in the middle of the Belarusian forest might take off. The Bate supporters were a picture of euphoric disbelief as Stanislav Dragun lost his marker and showed the aerial strength to glance in from a free-kick. Petr Cech made a handful of important saves to keep the scoreline down.Lacazette, who later apologised on Twitter for his red card, had the best of Arsenal’s chances but put a header over and saw another effort ruled out by the linesman’s flag. They will have to compensate for his suspension next week but also must locate some creativity to knit their game together. Emery was evasive on the subject of whether or not Mesut Özil will be back in his plans. “We can win with every player and lose with the same players,” he said.Arsenal must buck up their ideas to salvage the tie at the Emirates before they can begin to think more seriously about how far they are capable of going in this tournament. It all feels like backs-against-the-wall time in a competition that supposedly means so much."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/049266ba990558b0e4ac002fbd816f4bd788a902/0_196_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96dfe06dc4b2c36f0d83d824e2a63ca3","title":"celtic valencia europa league match report","story":"Valencia’s passage to the last 16 of the Europa League already seems secure. On a bruising night for Brendan Rodgers and Celtic, the Spanish side cantered towards a victory which should render next week at the Mestalla a formality.That Valencia have superior resource to Celtic is hardly breaking news. Nonetheless, a team normally so ebullient at home were curiously flat and error-ridden. Long before full time it had become a question of how many Valencia were of a mind to score. They settled for two, which barring an unforeseen collapse will prove sufficient.“Valencia are a team that wait on your mistakes,” said Rodgers. “Unfortunately for us, we made too many mistakes. You can get away with it domestically sometimes but at this level if you bring pressure on to yourself, it is difficult for you. We made basic mistakes. If you take them away, there wasn’t a lot in the game.”Progression to the knockout phase from a section which included RB Leipzig and Salzburg represented an excellent achievement by Celtic. There is a legitimate train of thought which suggests this competition, away from the harsh realities of the Champions League, represents the more logical scene for Rodgers’ team. The gulf in quality between domestic opponents in Scotland and those in Europe’s premier competition has proven problematic for Celtic to handle in the recent past.The Scottish champions entered this fixture in fine fettle. A wounding defeat at Ibrox to close 2018 had been followed by seven victories no team had scored against Celtic this year. Key to that run was Oliver Burke, the forward seeking to revive his career in Glasgow while on a loan deal from West Brom. Burke was deployed as the focal point of the Celtic attack here, in preference to the club’s record signing Odsonne Édouard. Remarkably for a player who has moved for combined transfer fees of almost £30m at the age of 21, this marked Burke’s debut in European competition.Valencia’s propensity to draw games has been the key aspect of their La Liga season. Their cagey opening at Celtic Park suggested the same outcome would suit them before Scott Bain produced acrobatics to bat away a Daniel Wass header that seemed destined for the top corner. Celtic had been the better team until then without troubling Neto, save for long-range efforts from Ryan Christie and Callum McGregor.Valencia had deployed the modern day rarity of two strikers, with the aim of capitalising on loose Celtic possession in defence an obvious one. In Daniel Parejo, the visitors had the standout player of the opening half. Burke was a peripheral figure for 36 minutes, at which point he narrowly failed to connect with a through ball from Scott Sinclair. Neto was duly able to boot clear.Celtic screamed in vain for offside as Valencia claimed the opening goal they just about deserved. Parejo lofted a wonderful pass to Rubén Sobrino, who unselfishly cut the ball back for Denis Cheryshev to tap in.Parejo, who had been an injury doubt before kick-off, was removed at half-time. The former Arsenal man Francis Coquelin was his replacement. The captain’s exit, however, did not blunt the Valencia threat.Scott Brown, who endured his latest torrid night against serious opposition, conceded possession and the ball was swiftly shifted towards Cheryshev on the left flank. A terrific cross followed, with Sobrino on hand to volley the ball past the stranded Bain. For Marcelino’s side, this was proving so blissfully simple against a Celtic team complicit in its own downfall. Rodgers later and rightly bemoaned a lack of “concentration and care”.Édouard and Timothy Weah appeared in place of Sinclair and Christie as Celtic attempted to stem the tide. Édouard’s first act was to tumble to the turf in pursuit of a penalty, which rather summed up Celtic’s level of desperation with half an hour of the game remaining. Unsurprisingly, no salvation was forthcoming for Rodgers.“It maybe seemed easy but it was difficult,” insisted Marcelino. The analysis raised eyebrows."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c1e3640fd84ca28d700d168da3e52313f4d6291/0_53_3540_2124/master/3540.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38158aeed7313fff260ee0521d766879","title":"malmo chelsea europa league match report","story":"European competition has offered Maurizio Sarri some respite. Chelsea may not have dazzled in southern Sweden, and the Italian was infuriated by the late concession that has left the tie more delicately balanced than he would have hoped. But, in the context of the wounds inflicted recently on his team at Arsenal, Bournemouth and Manchester City, any victory away from home, however workmanlike, is to be cherished.Malmö’s late reward, taken neatly on the gallop by Anders Christiansen as he burst away from Mateo Kovacic and on to Markus Rosenberg’s pass, will pep Swedish belief in next week’s return leg. Sarri was still cursing that collective sloppiness when, in stoppage time, Ross Barkley was caught in possession and the home fans briefly, tantalisingly, even sensed they might pull level. That opportunity was snuffed out by a mess of yellow-shirted bodies, though the head coach, a man on edge, made his exasperation very clear.How he would have craved settling this tie more emphatically given the daunting run of domestic fixtures – Manchester United in the FA Cup, Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final, Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League – that kicks in early next week. “If we concede a goal like this to a team like Manchester City or United or Tottenham, then you risk conceding three goals in 10 minutes,” said Sarri, frustrated that David Luiz and N’Golo Kanté had appeared culpable of letting standards slip marginally and momentarily in the buildup. “So we have to do better.“But the level of application and attention was good. It could have been better because we had three or four opportunities when it was 2-0, so we could have killed the match off. But I am happy with the confidence. It wasn’t easy to play like this after the last match.” It will take more than one win to recover poise from that six-goal drubbing at the Etihad Stadium but this was a start.His selection had been a calculated risk, his team’s attritional approach aimed at grinding down opponents still in pre-season with only five friendlies under their belt. Eden Hazard and Kanté were the cavalry flung into the fray late on against tiring legs, yet it was in that period that Malmö scored, with the substitutes ending the game alarmed as at least four supporters ran on to the pitch hoping to claim the visitors’ shirts. Hazard looked particularly shocked to be locked in a bear hug but later said: “It’s not an incident. He just asked for my shirt.”Nevertheless Uefa will surely investigate as it will, potentially, the exchange of plastic pint glasses and beer lobbed from both sides over the fencing separating rival supporters early on. Police and stewards had moved in to calm that situation. Chelsea are already waiting to hear if they are to be sanctioned for alleged racist chanting in December’s game in Budapest.They took heart from matters on the field once their pedigree told. They had enjoyed a near monopoly of the ball for long periods, for all that Malmö stretched them at set-plays, even if the possession occasionally lapsed into a plod. At least it served to draw Malmö’s sting and they eventually took the lead from their first clear-cut opportunity. Barkley benefited from Lasse Nielsen’s ill judged attempt to repel Pedro’s centre with a volley rather than a header. The ball bypassed the centre-half to land with the midfielder and, despite a clumsy first touch, he adjusted his feet swiftly enough in time to poke his shot beyond Johan Dahlin before Andreas Vindheim could muster a challenge on the cover.It was Chelsea’s first goal away from Stamford Bridge this year and a source of relief rather than elation. Their second oozed quality and was plucked on the counterattack from frantic home pressure, just after Arnór Ingvi Traustason had seen a shot deflected wide. Jorginho conjured a fine pass to liberate Barkley, charging forward into enemy territory, with Willian eventually wriggling round his marker to the byline to square for Olivier Giroud. The Frenchman was virtually on the goalline as he backheeled in a fifth Europa League goal of the season. Barkley would be denied further profit by Dahlin’s fingertips, with Giroud twice going close to adding a third to deflate the home crowd, only for Christiansen to fuel late hope."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a85b86207b6fa2448a82eda6e92530e4dffcf225/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f898a212a97492ddb4c3b3678aa18ff5","title":"fa cup talking points 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Swansea trying to find an on-field distraction, a striker searching for goals and a potential shock at NewportManchester United have lost five times to Chelsea in the FA Cup and the last of United’s eight Cup victories over the Blues came almost exactly two decades ago, in the 1999 quarter-finals, when Ole Gunnar Solskjær was in the team. Within the next month Solskjær’s side will play key games against Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Arsenal away from home and against Liverpool at Old Trafford, with the period ending with either a home match with Manchester City in the league, an FA Cup quarter-final or a few days off, depending on results here and at Newport County this weekend. By its end we will know if the Solskjaer Bounce was just a temporary elevation or whether the genial Norwegian has successfully coaxed this previously pedestrian team into taking flight. The first match of the run, against PSG on Tuesday, brought something of a reality check and also a couple of unwelcome injuries, with Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial both limping off, which may force Solskjaer into some fixture prioritisation. It will be interesting to see where this one ranks, given that United’s chances of silverware this season almost certainly hinge on it. SBQuite what Manchester City’s match-day squad will make of Rodney Parade when they step off their coach and make the long walk towards the away dressing-room before their match against Newport County is anyone’s guess, but we can only hope their reaction is captured on camera. Despite their lowly League Two status, Newport caused Tottenham all sorts of problems last season and have already beaten Leicester and Middlesbrough in Wales this time around. Indeed, their replay win over the team from Teesside could scarcely have been more comfortable and was far more emphatic than the 2-0 scoreline suggests. Tony Pulis’s side looked beaten men before kick-off, clearly nonplussed by both the atrocious weather conditions and the notion of having to muddy their spats in the quagmire of a provincial rugby stadium that holds less than 10,000 people. Clearly considering the contest beneath them, they came a cropper and the superstars of Manchester City will need to be vigilant in the face of potential humiliation. Should the unthinkable happen, the laughter from Rodney Parade, Pillgwenlly and Lliswerry would echo around the world. BGSo Frank Lampard, do you stick or twist? With Derby continuing to push hard for promotion from the Championship, their manager could be forgiven for looking upon an FA Cup tie away to Premier League opponents as an unwanted distraction that his team are unlikely to win anyway. So make a load of changes and take the hit. That, however, would go against Lampard’s approach to facing top-flight sides in cup competitions this season – strong sides were sent out against Manchester United and Chelsea in the Carabao Cup as well as against Southampton (twice) in the FA Cup. So expect more of the same from the visitors to the Amex Stadium, and given Brighton’s form – four defeats and three draws from their last seven matches – a strong start could end with Derby on the right side of a shock. SNJavi Gracia’s assessment of QPR as a team in good form seems generous, but under the Loftus Road lights on Friday night this may well be, as the Spaniard predicts, “a very demanding game”. In their two FA Cup games this season not one Watford player has kept his place from the preceding league fixture. Given the settled nature of their league side – only 16 players have made more than five league starts this season – the possibility of cup appearances has been the only way the Spaniard has been able to incentivise fringe players. For a club that has reached a major final only once, and never won any competition more prestigious than the third tier, is it now time for the Hornets to change tack? Should they claim a place in the quarter-finals Watford will be, at worst, the fourth highest-ranked side still in the competition they would probably expect even their second string to beat a woefully out-of-form QPR, but any misjudgement will cause significant regret. SBRock bottom of League One but not so adrift that all hope of staying up has gone, Wimbledon entertain Millwall from the ision above at the 4,850-capacity Kingsmeadow, where visiting fans will have an allocation of 750 tickets. Along with the tie between Swansea and Brentford, this is one of only two FA Cup matches out of eight not being televised this season, which means both clubs will miss out on the always welcome windfall they earn for welcoming the TV cameras into their grounds. But with £360,000 in prize-money going to the winners of this match, this is not a game either cash-strapped club can take lightly. With £250,000 also going to the Football League team from each ision that goes the furthest, Wimbledon would earn that bonus if they win and Doncaster go out to Crystal Palace. This may not be the glamour tie either struggling side hoped for, but it is one that each one will be very eager to win. BGSince ending a transfer window in which Callum Hudson-Odoi’s pursuit by Bayern Munich was one of the longest-running and most intriguing stories by insisting the player is “the future of our club … the future of English football” and “one of the best 18-year-old players in Europe”, Maurizio Sarri has been almost comically reluctant to let him actually play football. He was not in the squad to face Bournemouth because “one winger had to be in the stands”, played 13 minutes against Huddersfield and was back out of the squad for the visit to Manchester City, before getting another six minutes of action at Malmö on Thursday. But he has played every minute of Chelsea’s FA Cup run so far, claiming two assists against Nottingham Forest and a goal against Sheffield Wednesday. The last thing Sarri needs, having guided his team to an aggregate scoreline of 0-13 in their last four domestic away games, is to invite further criticism by wilfully and unnecessarily ignoring a popular youth-team product. But Manchester United are a very different prospect to Chelsea’s last two Cup opponents, so it will be interesting to see whether Hudson-Odoi starts once again and if not, how Sarri explains it. Whatever is preventing the Italian from fielding his young forward, it certainly isn’t exhaustion. SBWhisper it quietly but Christian Benteke might be ready to be good at football again. Nobody should be getting carried away given this is a striker who has not scored since Crystal Palace’s 5-0 victory over Leicester in late April, but the Belgian is back for Roy Hodgson’s side after recovering from a knee injury and, having started their last two games, shown glimpses of the talent that persuaded Liverpool to once spend £32.5m on him. A trip to Doncaster represents a chance for Benteke to further his return to form and score that long-awaited goal. It will not be easy against in-form opponents but Doncaster have the worst defence in League One’s top six – 39 goals conceded in 31 games – and that should also fuel Benteke with confidence ahead of this fixture. SNIt is fair to say Wolves have got to the fifth-round the hard way. First, Liverpool were despatched at Molineux, before two fourth-round games against Shrewsbury in which Nuno Espírito Santo’s men twice had to battle back against resilient opponents. Now comes another test – Bristol City, who sit fifth in the Championship and have won each of their last nine games in all competitions, including a third-round victory over Huddersfield. Lee Johnson’s men with hope they can take another Premier League scalp at Ashton Gate on Sunday but Wolves are formidable opponents when they are at full-strength – which was not the case in either game against Shrewsbury – so should the likes of Rúben Neves, João Moutinho and Raúl Jiménez start at the weekend then they should prevail. In this most open of competitions who knows how far Wolves could go. SNSwansea City won by the odd goal of five when they travelled to Brentford in December and will enjoy home advantage when the two Championship sides meet again on Saturday. Currently seven points off the play-offs, Swansea are performing commendably considering their manager, Graham Potter, has been forced to work with one arm tied behind his back during this, his maiden season in England. The 43-year-old, who joined from Östersund, has been undermined by his employers in two consecutive transfer windows and is currently dealing with the aftermath of the resignation of Huw Jenkins as the club’s chairman. With the Swansea City Supporters’ Trust currently embroiled in a dispute with the club’s American owners, Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, the Welsh club’s players will struggle to match all that off-field drama when their threadbare, academy-reliant team lines up against Brentford. While making the last eight and potentially going further should not be beyond them, it would mark a fine achievement in a season of extreme turbulence. BGThe FA Cup has provided QPR with their only wins of 2019, the club sitting bottom of the Championship form table after a winless run that dates back to Boxing Day. As the new year dawned they were eighth in the table and cautiously eyeing the play-offs now they are 16th, only a point better off and grateful that the bottom three are sufficiently hopeless that the Hoops are only three points closer to the trapdoor than they were in December. Still, they are in the FA Cup in mid-February, which is a novel sensation. QPR’s Cup record is abysmal they have already won as many FA Cup ties this season as they managed in the last 17 put together. The last time they went past the fifth round it was 1995, they were on their way to an eighth-place finish in the top flight, Les Ferdinand was their star striker, Ian Holloway was in midfield and even then they needed a stoppage-time Clive Wilson penalty to get past Millwall. Watford are likely to field a much-changed line-up once again, but even so there seems little cause, either from current form or long-term history, for genuine optimism.

We were only at risk in setpieces and were in control of the match. We deserved to win by more. But I am happy because we played with confidence and that wasn’t really very easy after the last match.”“We conceded a goal on a mistake. That can happen. But the level of attention was very god for 90 minutes. So I am very happy but we know very well that we have to gain qualification in the next match. I am always confident but sometimes we’ve had the wrong approach to matches os we need to be careful in every match.” Azpilicueta’s verdict: “After that tough defeat last Sunday it was important to start well. We were in control at 2-0 and had chances to have a more comfortable result but they scored. So we still have to play next Thursday. In the second half we had control of the game so it was frustrating to concede a goal and not go to Stamford bridge with a better result ... Chelsea is all about winning. Sunday was unacceptable. We’ve had our reaction but we need consistency.”Here, courtesy of Hakan Burden, are the lyrics (and translation!) to the Dirty Old Town song that Malmo wins were signing throughout much of the second half. Thanks Hakan.Min far han sa, att i Malmö stadSpelar ett lag, som är så jävla braFärgen är blå, den är vacker som fåKom här min påg, så kommer du förstå(My father said, in Malmö cityThere is a team, so fucking prettyThe colour is blue, a colour so grandCome here my boy, and you’ll understand)Chelsea have their first away win of 2019, one foot in the last 16 of the Europa League and some self-respect back after Sunday’s king by Man City. This was a deserved win and a broadly satisfactory performance, although there were still sloppy lapses, notably from Barkley and David Luiz, who both did some fine things as well.90+2 min: Barkley gets caught in possession in midfield and suddenly Malmo pile forward on the counter. Chelsea regroup quickly enough to suppress the mini-revolt, but Sarri is furious on the sidelines: one severe ear-bashing on the way for Barkley, you fancy.90+2 min: Giroud has a blast from a difficult angle after a pass by his usual accomplice, Hazard. The keeper makes a good save with his feet.90 min: Chelsea are playing smart now, keeping the ball deftly. Malmo have three more minutes to find an equaliser but don’t look capable of getting the ball.88 min: Chelsea have the ball where they want it - deep in opposing territory - and look happy to just keep it there. “David Luiz is killing this team with yet another run forward followed by a poor pass followed by him not getting back in time to prevent goal on the break,” snorts Rob Coughlin. “It’s infuriating.”86 min: Malmo attack down the right, Vindheim helping it on to Rosenberg. David Luiz clears the incoming cross.Chelsea substitution: Hudson-Odi on, Pedro off. Malmo fans are signing a chant to the tune of Dirty Old Town. Anyone know their words?82 min: That goal has infused Malmo with new belief. Suddenly this look like being a far more awkward last 10 minutes for Chelsea, who seemed to be cruising just a couple of minutes ago.Malmo looked out for the count but have suddenly hit a powerful blow thanks to a rapid counter-attack! Rosenberg did well to collect the ball wide on the right and then pick out Christansen scampering through the middle, with Kovacic struggling to keep up. And Christiansen touch one touch before slotting the ball past the advancing Kepa from 16 yards!75 min: It look as though Kante has not, in fact, gone in as the central linchpin. Kovacic has been moved there instead and Kante is at his now familiar berth on the right. Sarri really doesn’t trust his passing.Chelsea substitution: Kanté on, Jorginho off. Kanté as a central defensive midfielder? What is Sarri thinking!? 71 min: Willian releases Giroud with a cheeky quick freekick over the top of the dozing Swedish defender. Giroud tries to sweep it into the net with an acorbatic volley but slices it badly, eliciting jeers from the crowd. Malmo substitutions: Strandberg and Lewicki on, Antonsson and Traustason off. 69 min: Another classy Chelsea attack ends with Barkley teeing up Pedro, who tries to curl into the far corner from the edge of the box. Again a defender gets a touch on it - Vindheim, to be precise - and the ball drifts just wide for a corner.67 min: Malmo are looking weary as Chelsea turn the screw.66 min: Barkley makes a jagged run infield from the left and the slips a pass into Giroud at the edge of the area and continues his run in anticipation of a return ball. Giroud duly obliges and Barkley is in with another scoring opportunity - but his shot is deflected over the bar by a lunging defender for a corner!64 min: Chelsea are starting to swish it up now. Lots of nice one-touch passing and Willian, in particular, is playing with a flourish.62 min: Sarri spoke beforehand about introducing Hazard and Higuain with about 15 minutes left but there’s no need for him to do that now. Let’s have another look at Hudson-Odoi instead. A lovely counter-attacking goal! Barkley led the charge from midfield before feeding Willian to his left. The Brazilian ran into the box, danced past a defender and aimed a low pass to Giroud, who helped the ball into the net from close range with an artful flick! 56 min: The pressure keeps coming from Malmo. A corner is cleared to the edge of the area, where Traustason arrives to unleash a fierce shot. David Luiz does well to nod it just wide of the post for another corner.55 min: Pressure growing from Malmo. Azpilicueta has to make another important intervention to stop Rosenberg from collecting a clever through by by Bachirou, who had broke from midfield by playing foxy one-two with a teammate.53 min: Corner to Malmo following a well worked attack. Azpilicueta had to put a low cross from the left behind. Malmo botch the corner.52 min: Pedro leads a promising Chelsea counter-attack, fizzing a low pass into the feet of Giroud, who tries to hold off the defender and take the ball as he swivels. But he gets it wrong and clumps into the defender instead, conceding a freekick.50 min: Bengsston aims a good diagonal pass towards Vindheim, who has momentarily got the wrong side of Emerson. But the forward miscontrols and Emerson takes advantage.48 min: Giroud lays the ball back nicely to Jorginho, who considers opening fire from 25 yards but then turns to his right and slides the ball out to Azpilicueta, whose low cross is cleared.47 min: David Luiz snuffs out the first hint of danger from the hosts in the second half, albeit thanks to a suspiciously soft fall under slight pressure. The ref awards a freekick.

Let’s take a moment to envision life without Simon Cowell’s cash cow …Let’s take a trip to YouTube, where we find the newly released trailer for Richard Curtis and Danny Boyle’s Yesterday. The movie tells the story of a world that has forgotten the Beatles ever existed but, in a twist of Lars von Trier-level cinematic bleakness, has total recall of James Corden. The film also seems to tell the story of a casting department that has never heard of Game of Thrones, because the film features Ed Sheeran in an acting role.It’s a busy time for bands reviving decades-old hits via the silver screen. So, to avoid confusion, Yesterday must not be mistaken for hit-packed movies such as Bohemian Rhapsody or Mamma Mia!, which, rather than trading on Yesterday’s curiously Farage-friendly notion that society is crying out for a return to the good old days of Britain as pop’s leading exporter, celebrated the free movement of music between European countries and told the story of a small island that actually welcomed immigrants.But there are interesting questions posed by the central conceit of Yesterday, which follows the story of the one man who does remember the work of George, Ringo et al, and who uses this knowledge to pass the Beatles’ Movie Medley hitmakers’ songs off as his own. Not least among these questions are: is Ed Sheeran (who stars in the film as Ed Sheeran) under the misapprehension that he is already living in a similar film about Marvin Gaye, and are we all extras in that film, representing one of the most unappealing examples yet of simulation theory?Also, if you had every single Beatles song rattling around in your head, you might consider their dissemination to be broadly in the public interest after all, it’s fair to say that the Beatles had their moments vis-a-vis the whole toe-tapper thing. But how far would this principle extend into other areas of our cultural lives?If you were the only person who remembered Facebook, would you spread the word, or quite frankly keep your thoughts to yourself? And is it fair to say that life would not be worse – and might actually be marginally more bearable – if you switched the Beatles for Muse and decided to join a monastery? When Big Brother first hit our screens, we all thought it might have been quite an interesting social experiment, did we not? But perhaps many of us would now say that was a corner of Elstree that should never have been televised. And putting yourself in the shoes – then, inevitably, the jeans – of Simon Cowell, for rather more pressing reasons that have come to light in this week’s news headlines, how would you behave if you woke up one morning to discover that the UK had suddenly forgotten everything about The X Factor? (As opposed to everyone slowly forgetting, to the tune of 10 million jettisoned viewers since 2010.)For context, current rumblings are trumpeting the partial, or the total, and the imminent, or the not-for-ages disappearance from ITV of The X Factor (Cowell’s current deal with ITV ends this year). Unnamed Chatty Cathys appear in many of the stories with quotes ranging from, “There will definitely be a show this year” to, “This year’s auditions are axed for sure”, two apparently contradictory statements that aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive. Rumours suggest that the last-minute cancellation of this year’s auditions could pave the way for a champion-of-champions approach that might finally – finally! – see stars such as Ben Haenow back on primetime.Other format shifts have been mooted, including a throwback to 2006’s wisely-never-repeated one-series wonder X Factor: Battle of the Stars, which, in scenes that scarred a generation, saw Gillian McKeith honking her way through I Just Want to Make Love to You and Chris Moyles romping to third place. At the time even Cowell described the Battle of the Stars as “pointless”, but reports suggest it may be discussed as a possible way forward. Trigger warning: it’s impossible to consider that option without envisaging Keith Lemon coming in at least second place.Why keep it going at all? For elucidation, let’s head over to a quote from last year in which Cowell, with all the enthusiasm of a world-weary sausage salesman, said: “We could probably do three years or five years. It makes a lot of money.” There’s nothing quite like putting a price on great art. Which is to say, this is nothing like putting a price on great art. But setting to one side the enormous sums of cash that The X Factor has made and continues to generate for Cowell, his record label and ITV, what if The X Factor really had never existed?Well, our collective consciousness would sadly wave goodbye to the triumphant oeuvre of bongo-bothering tunemaul practitioner Wagner. We might never have seen Calvin Harris with a pineapple on his head. Christopher Maloney would have more of a spring in his step and we could do away with the continued insistence – nearly two decades after his last successful artist launch – that Louis Walsh knows what he’s talking about. And yet. Nature would, one hopes, still find a way.Leona Lewis, a former stage school and Brit School attendee, would surely still have warbled her way to some sort of success. Harry Styles’s hair would still somehow have achieved global recognition. Jack Quickenden would still have found his way to Portsmouth for last year’s panto season. And had The X Factor – and Popstars, and Pop Idol – never existed, the UK music industry would never have come to rely on TV platforms to launch pop artists, meaning that it would never have forgotten how to create and nurture decent pop stars. It’s amazing that the 2016 European referendum ever went ahead considering how clearly X Factor winners such as Leon Jackson highlighted the risks that come with leaving things to a public vote if most of those doing the voting are twice the age of the people who will ultimately have to deal with the outcome.Perhaps this points us, rather circuitously, to the next steps for both The X Factor and Richard Curtis: a jukebox movie that tells the story of Brexit, set to the hits of 15 years’ worth of X Factor winners. Who wouldn’t pay good money to see Steve Brookstein reprising Against All Odds in the role of Jean-Claude Juncker?One of this week’s most distressing celebrity headlines comes from the Mirror, which, on Wednesday, relayed news regarding the final days of Nasa’s most beloved robotic explorer under the words: “Mars rover Opportunity dies, aged 15”. The brave fella’s reported final message echoed the internal monologue many of us endure in these testing times: “My battery is low, and it’s getting dark.” Nasa had broadcast more than 1,000 wake-up commands to Opportunity, but there was no response. And with that, Opportunity was lost in a cloud of space dust. A dignified end to a brave mission.Back on Earth, Gemma Collins, who once fell in a hole, is not in darkness. The sun is shining brightly and she is in hay-making mode following her ejection from Dancing on Ice. Gemma’s time on the show is more robustly summarised by the mask slipping in leaked backstage audio of a tantrum regarding a visit to Wales, than by any of her perfunctory on-screen endeavours. Regardless, Collins’s profile has benefitted so much from appearing on the show that her fee for nightclub appearances apparently now stands at £13,000 an hour.Let’s just say it. Opportunity would have been fine with a trip to Wales. Opportunity would probably appear in nightclubs for 10 quid, a finger buffet and a cab fare home. Opportunity – a bundle of wires, metal and rubber – showed more humanity in its final eight-word message than Collins has mustered in the past eight years. We don’t always choose the role models who will guide us through life often, they seem to choose us. But, given a choice between Opportunity and opportunism, it’s not a hard decision."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14105396df5ef713cc76ff6b07cf5802fcbff397/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9a015a93cc43e732b05574d87a25b4c9 960w","title":"a week at guantanamo bay today in focus podcast","story":"’s Julian Borger recently spent a week at the Guantánamo Bay detention facility, attending the 33rd pre-trial hearing of five 911 suspects.

And who better to deputise for the prime minister during the latest debate on why the government still doesn’t have a clue about what it’s doing about Brexit than the Brexit secretary himself? Stephen Barclay’s the one member of the cabinet whose job description is to know nothing whatsoever about Brexit. A man put on the payroll for the sole purpose of being kept out of the loop.In a parallel, fairer, world, Barclay would be an anonymous financial adviser, whose only success was to have been runner-up in a lifetime achievement award hosted by the north-east Cambridgeshire regional chamber of commerce for being the only person dim enough to have mis-sold himself his own pension.Instead he finds himself charged with misleading the country over the government’s Brexit policy. A job he does with ease, as he doesn’t even know what it is he doesn’t know.Barclay opened the debate by mumbling that it was still government policy not to have a policy. And he was happy to confirm that, as the prime minister had been taken hostage by the European Research Group, the natural consequence of accepting the impossible demands of the Brady amendment calling for the renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement, was that the UK would almost certainly be leaving the EU on 29 March with no deal.Several Tory Brexiters could scarcely believe their luck. They had been expecting far more of a fight than this and hurriedly sought reassurances that their preferred “no deal” was still on the table.Owen Paterson wanted confirmation that the Malthouse compromise really was as pointless as his appointment to the Alternative Arrangements Working Group had indicated. Barclay was delighted to confirm this. He had spoken at length to Jean-Michel Jarre and they had agreed that squads of highly trained, armed, badgers were the key to solving the Northern Ireland backstop.This didn’t go down well with the Tories’ Caroline Spelman, who was disappointed to discover that her own amendment that had been passed – expressing parliament’s aversion to a no deal – was not being taken as seriously by the government as the Brady amendment.Barclay had an answer ready. The only way the government could send a clear message to the EU showing we were a nation that could be trusted in negotiations was to act in a thoroughly untrustworthy way by cherry picking the best amendments.Keir Starmer becomes more impressive with each outing at the despatch box. Mainly because he now merely has to reiterate what everyone, except Barclay, knows – namely that the prime minister was merely running down the clock and, if push came to shove, was quite happy to leave the EU with no deal if that was the price of keeping the Tory party more or less together.But he is also helped by getting to fend off witless interventions from some Conservatives. James Cleverly tried to claim that May running down the clock was conclusive proof she couldn’t be running down the clock, while Alex Chalk didn’t even seem to realise he had voted against the government’s withdrawal agreement by backing the Brady amendment. This is politics 101. And these are supposed to be two of the Tory party’s rising stars.The one flaw in the shadow Brexit secretary’s performance was that Labour had yet to come up with an alternative plan of their own. Every time Starmer produces something vaguely sensible, Jeremy Corbyn puts a red line through it. At this rate, Labour and the Tories are in a race to see which party will split first.Thereafter the debate followed a predictable course. It was the same as every other Brexit debate, only a bit more rubbish. The more serious the situation becomes the more it resembles a third-rate farce.The only thing that comes close to uniting the Brexiters and remainers is a mutual distrust of anything said by the government front bench. The idea that a minister might actually be able to distinguish between truth and lies – or even achieve something – has become unimaginable.It ended in chaos. First Anna Soubry pulled her amendment as the government had indicated it would provide an impact analysis of a no-deal Brexit. Then both the leaver and remainer Tories abstained so that the government was defeated on the main motion it had won two weeks previously.You couldn’t make it up. May could not even win a meaningless vote. Which, ironically, in itself had meaning. Humiliation. For her and the country. The EU must be pissing themselves. How can you negotiate with people who are certifiable?Corbyn immediately demanded that May got to the despatch box to give a statement declaring she accepted that her strategy had failed and that she would come back with a plan that could win a majority in parliament. Which would have been a start.Only there was no sign of the prime minister. And none of her ministers was prepared to take the hit for her. Only the sound of a clock ticking to break the silence. May was holed up in Downing Street. Her software stripped bare. Searching for a programme. Any programme. Control. Alt. Delete."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7d92ad44dce5da7ca4c37dd14a4b2fb9ab3a41a/162_90_1754_1052/master/1754.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd4633a5099aa68443e7643f3e509808","title":"conservatives react angrily to defeat of mays brexit plan","story":"Pro-remain MPs and even some ministers furious at ERG’s abstentionsTheresa May is set to face intense pressure from remain-minded Conservative MPs to finally face down hardline Brexiters in her party after a planned restatement of a departure strategy agreed two weeks ago by the Commons was defeated.Abstentions by MPs from the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) played a big part in seeing the government motion voted down after the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, was unable to persuade them it did not take a no-deal departure off the table.While May loyalists scrambled to play down the importance of the vote, privately MPs and even some ministers were furious at the ERG and insistent the prime minister had to change course in the coming days.“There is a degree of wishful thinking going on that the EU can ever do enough to satisfy the Brexit extremists,” one minister said.“She wants to try to square the circle and it’s just not looking likely. She has a choice: seek the agreement across the House or the country will be out without a deal. They don’t compromise, they never have.”Ahead of another promised government Brexit motion at the end of the month, a number of ministers are known to be considering voting for amendments that could meaningfully stop no deal or extend article 50, such as one proposed previously by Yvette Cooper.A cabinet source said: “Once again the ERG have made life hell for the prime minister and put their own fantasies in the way of pragmatic politics.”One former minister said the “fake consensus” in the party around the Brady amendment had been exposed by Wednesday night’s vote. “It was never going to last. She has to pick. Either she’s serious about doing a no deal if necessary, in which case she’s a Ukip prime minister, and keeps the ERG onside but fractures the rest of the party, or she rules it out and she’s a Conservative PM but loses the ERG. At the moment she’s nowhere and pleasing no one. It’s about choices. And she won’t make one.”Others were as outspoken in public. After the defeat Nick Boles, the Grantham MP who has been central to efforts to prevent no deal, tweeted: “Maybe, just maybe, the penny will now drop with prime minister and her chief whip that the hardliners in the ERG want a no-deal Brexit and will stop at nothing to get it.”Tory MP Heidi Allen said it was clear the Eurosceptics were now intending to force a no-deal Brexit. “The ERG, as many of us have been saying to the prime minister for well over a year now, are in control and always have been,” she said.“Their game plan has been unwavering from the beginning in its determination to achieve no deal. Parliament must be given the opportunity to take control of the process and try and coalesce around a softer Brexit position. If this is not possible, as is highly likely, we must put the question back to the public.”Anna Soubry, an anti-Brexit Tory MP, said she was “absolutely delighted” the government agreed to release details of cabinet briefings on the consequences of no deal, meaning she could withdraw her amendment seeking this.But Soubry told the BBC: “What an absolute fiasco this is. It’s a lack of leadership in both of our broken parties, and frankly we need a different, better way of doing politics in this country, and we need it now.”Brexiter Tories blamed the defeat on what one, Bernard Jenkin, called “the government’s clumsiness”.Steve Baker, deputy chair of the ERG, used a point of order after the vote result to urge May to devote her efforts to pushing the so-called Malthouse compromise, a plan drawn up by a series of Conservative MPs to circumvent the controversial Irish border backstop through as-yet-unknown technology to avoid customs checks.James Cleverly, a Conservative party vice-chair and a key May loyalist, insisted that MPs and the EU should read “not very much” into the vote.“The more significant votes were the votes we had last month which showed that the House didn’t agree with the first draft of the withdrawal agreement, made the point that the backstop was where the difficulty lay, and that if she were able to make amendments around the backstop, that would be something that would probably command a majority,” he told the BBC.The complex and precarious choreography for the government was obvious from the start of the opening speech in the debate, by Barclay.While the mass of Tory MPs were happy with the main element of the motion – tasking May with seeking a revised departure deal – the other amendment passed a fortnight ago, which sought to rule out no deal, was worrying Brexiters.In what seemed like a planned move, Barclay’s predecessor as Brexit secretary, David Davis, intervened in the speech to seek reassurance Brexit would happen on 29 March, whatever the circumstances. Barclay said he was “very happy” to do that.While this was intended to mollify the ERG it prompted angry interventions from other Conservatives, including Caroline Spelman, whose amendment two weeks ago had sought to stop no deal. It would be “contemptuous of this house” if Barclay sought to erase the vote for her amendment, Spelman said.Justine Greening, the former education secretary, also raised her concerns: “The reality is that the vote against no deal in this house was more convincingly passed, including with cross-party support, than the vote to have the prime minister go back and negotiate on alternative arrangements. The government can’t simply just pick and choose which votes it wants to support.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d3347b944fe1114c4b4cc7c263e2130786eb7e6/0_280_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6acd8b0a14e08ac7b8287c0e75fee06","title":"six things weve learned from mays latest brexit defeat","story":"The PM will find it harder to argue she has Commons backing for her strategy after MPs voted against her motionSome Commons votes have very clear consequences – either legislative or political (like a no-confidence vote). Others are rather harder to interpret. May’s defeat on Thursday was definitely in the second category, but that does not mean it does not matter.This may turn out to be a significant moment in the Brexit saga. Here is a snap analysis of what it means.Two weeks ago May secured a majority for the Brady amendment. Thursday’s vote has not entirely reversed that – Brady would probably still pass, if there were another vote. But it shows that some of the Tories who backed Brady were not willing to do so if that was combined with a suggestion that a no-deal Brexit should be off the table.This became apparent during the opening of the debate when Tory Brexiters were saying the Malthouse compromise should be official government policy, but Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, refused to concede this.It is hard to see the point in doing a deal with a leader who cannot get what she agrees through parliament.That was the last-minute concession announced by Chris Heaton-Harris. If it says what Anna Soubry thinks it will say, it will strengthen the hand of those MPs arguing that no deal should be ruled out. Although there is a lot of evidence suggesting that the public at large are less concerned about these warnings.Leavers and remainers were saying Thursday morning that if the government had consulted more widely when drafting its motion the defeat could have been easily averted. It is also arguable that the government, instead of offering Soubry what she wanted, would have been better letting her put her amendment to a vote. It would have been defeated, but at least it would have lost on an issue where it was willing to lose. On the plus side, there would have been no vote on the main motion, meaning no split with the ERG and no prospect of the vote two weeks ago arguably being reversed.Thursday’s debate essentially postponed key decisions: there was no vote on giving parliament the power to rule out a second referendum, and no vote on a second referendum. But Tories planning to back the Yvette Cooper amendment and bill giving the Commons the power to rule out no deal will be emboldened – especially when they read the No 10 statement implying May is attentive to MPs who want to keep no deal as an option. And during the debate it became clear that Labour MPs set on voting for a second referendum will not wait much longer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a4d7ae3af185f6c218969bd5e56cad467edfcf8/0_0_2555_1533/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd6170f7a73750dcfe8fb0605fd59173","title":"theresa may defeated on brexit again as erg tories abstain","story":"PM defeated by 303 votes to 258, plunging hopes of uniting her party around renegotiated deal into chaosTheresa May has suffered an embarrassing defeat at the hands of hardline Eurosceptics, plunging her hopes of uniting the Conservatives around a renegotiated Brexit deal into chaos.The prime minister failed to win support for her EU strategy after the European Research Group (ERG), led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, abstained on a government motion because it appeared to rule out a no-deal Brexit.The defeat marks the end of a temporary truce over Brexit among Conservative MPs, who had voted last month in favour of May’s strategy if she could obtain some concessions from Brussels on the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop.The prime minister was not present for the House of Commons defeat, by 303 votes to 258, in which she again lost control of her party in the crucial final weeks before Britain is due to leave the EU on 29 March.It is likely to cause fresh doubt in Brussels that May has the power to win parliament’s support for an amended EU withdrawal agreement. The Eurosceptic refusal to cooperate with No 10 underlined the difficulty the prime minister is likely to face in securing concessions from the EU that will satisfy them.In Brussels, diplomats said the result confirmed that the prime minister was incapable of commanding the support of her party on key votes, and that she needed to work cross-party. “No one can take any good from this,” said one diplomat.The vote is not binding but it appeared to be a show of strength by around 60 MPs in the ERG, which included Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary and Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister. A small number of pro-EU MPs also refused to back the motion.Senior figures in the ERG used the result to increase pressure on the government to adopt the so-called Malthouse compromise – a proposal to use unspecified technology to avoid customs checks at the Irish border – which the EU appears likely to reject. Many in the ERG would be equally happy to see a no-deal Brexit.No 10 played down the significance of the vote and insisted that May understood the concerns of the ERG. However, that appeared only to infuriate many remain-supporting Tories who are determined to block a no-deal Brexit.The government offered a separate concession to remain-supporting Tory MP Anna Soubry that it would publish some papers relating to the impact of a no-deal Brexit. However, one ERG source said the group was unconcerned about this because the public paid no attention to “project fear” at the referendum. Nick Boles, a former government minister, said the vote should be a wake-up call to May that she cannot rely on the ERG’s support.“Maybe, just maybe, the penny will now drop with prime minister and her chief whip that the hardliners in the ERG want a no-deal Brexit and will stop at nothing to get it,” he said. “Responsible MPs of all parties must come together on 27 and 28 March and stop them.”In an escalation of tensions, Richard Harrington, one of May’s business ministers, even suggested MPs in the ERG should join Ukip.“The prime minister has done a pretty good job of standing up to them up till now, but they were drinking champagne to celebrate her losing her deal and I regard that as being treachery,” he told the House magazine.“I read that Nigel Farage is setting up a new party called ‘Brexit’ and if I were them I’d be looking at that, because that seems to reflect their views more than the Conservative party does. They should read carefully what that party’s got to offer, because in my view they’re not Conservatives.“There are people who are very solid and stringent in their views and if I were they I would be looking at a party that seems designed for them – Nigel Farage’s party.”He also dismissed the Malthouse compromise as “fanciful nonsense”.May had previously said that she had “a substantial and sustainable majority” among MPs for her approach, after parliament voted in January for her to seek “alternative arrangements” to the Northern Ireland backstop from the EU and separately against a no-deal Brexit.The government motion simply restated parliament’s position, but the hardline Eurosceptics balked at the idea of endorsing a strategy that takes a no-deal Brexit off the table. MPs will next get a chance to debate and vote on May’s EU strategy on 27 February.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, demanded that May come to the House of Commons to explain her Brexit plan in the absence of parliamentary support for her approach.“Tonight’s vote shows there is no majority for the prime minister’s course of action in dealing with Brexit,” he said. “Yet again her government has been defeated. The government cannot keen on ignoring parliament or ploughing on towards 29 March without a coherent plan.”No 10, however, simply issued a statement saying that May understood the concerns of her Conservative colleagues. Downing Street had always insisted that it never intended to remove the option of pursing a no deal Brexit.“While we didn’t secure the support of the Commons this evening, the prime minister continues to believe, and the debate itself indicated, that far from objecting to securing changes to the backstop that will allow us to leave with a deal, there was a concern from some Conservative colleagues about taking no deal off the table at this stage,” the statement said.“The motion on 29 January remains the only one the House of Commons has passed expressing what it does want, and that is legally binding changes to address concerns about the backstop. The government will continue to pursue this with the EU to ensure we leave on time on 29 March.”May also attempted to shift some blame on to Labour, saying its failure to support her motion made the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal more likely.Labour sources said panicking Conservative whips had discussed the possibility with them of accepting a Labour motion and voting with the opposition in order to avoid an embarrassing defeat. Ultimately, however, they decided to accept a humiliating loss rather than appear to join forces with the opposition.Labour also suffered a split as 41 backbench rebels voted with the SNP to delay Brexit. Those defying the party whip included Chuka Umunna, Chris Leslie, David Lammy, Luciana Berger and Margaret Hodge. They were joined by two pro-EU Conservatives – Ken Clarke and Sarah Wollaston."},{"url":null,"title":"how did your mp vote on the latest brexit motion","story":"Theresa May suffered another defeat on Brexit tonight as both pro- and anti-European Tories helped vote down a motion supporting her approach to negotiations.

Even the sober sub-set of Brexit promoters concedes the latter short-term point. But at least one likely outcome is becoming clearer: the Bank of England would not make things worse by cranking up interest rates.This plotline for rates always looked absurd. A no-deal outcome would surely require the Bank to deploy common sense and look beyond its inflation-fighting mission. Protecting jobs and growth would become the priority, as its fuller mandate allows, meaning no short-term increases in the cost of borrowing.Thank goodness, then, that Gertjan Vlieghe, one of the Bank’s rate-setters, is alert to the point. “In the case of a no-deal scenario I judge that an easing or an extended pause in monetary policy is more likely to be the appropriate policy response than a tightening,” he said in a speech on Thursday. Well, quite.Governor Mark Carney has been unfairly criticised at times for his comments on Brexit, but that November document was not his finest hour. Even his colleagues now seem to think the “worst-case” scenario, with interest rate soaring, was over-egged. A no-deal exit would be bad enough there was no need to exaggerate.But that would be the wrong way to look at things. Drug development is a long-term game. It can take a decade to get an early-stage compound from the lab to the market, and the reinvention of AstraZeneca’s pipeline should be judged over similar horizons. The group was clobbered by the patent expiry on the former blockbuster cholesterol drug Crestor recovery was never going to arrive quickly.Back in 2014, Soriot’s main promise was that the group could achieve annual sales of $45bn (£35bn) in 2023, which still sounds slightly hopeful given that the tally for 2018 was $22bn. But he’s sticking to the target and, as the now-rising share price indicates, the market thinks AstraZeneca will at least get close now that it has new drugs on the market with more to follow.Soriot remains one of the FTSE 100’s most over-rewarded bosses - his £9.4m in 2017 and £13m in 2016 were rewards for success before it had happened, as rebellious investors rightly argued. But that commercial success may now finally be appearing (heaven knows what he’ll collect when it does), which is clearly good news for the UK life sciences industry.AstraZeneca still has to convert its new sales momentum into extra profit, and then reward patient shareholders with a better idend. But rejecting Pfizer was definitely the correct choice.Oh dear, the venerable Engineering Employers’ Federation, or EEF, is rebranding. It wishes to be known as Make UK in future. Are the engineers trying to invoke Trump-style visions of making the UK great again, or have they succumbed to the horrible habit of turning verbs into nouns?

Three skin experts share their dos and don’ts for clear, glowing skinFeed your skinDid you know we all have our own skin flora? “Bacteria, yeast and viruses make up our skin microbiome,” says Pfeffer. “You want to foster and encourage your healthy microbiome to flourish and be at its most erse. By doing this, those microorganisms will protect your skin from infection, pollutants and pathogens which contribute to ageing, acne and eczema.”Pfeffer recommends using pH-balanced skincare, as anything too harsh, such as alcohol or soap, can destroy the bacteria. “Incorporate probiotics into your routine inside and out!” she adds.Ramp up your hydrationIt’s old news that drinking water is good for us, but did you know you can supercharge the hydration benefits of your H2O? “Drinking water is important, however, you may find you still feel dehydrated externally,” says Reynolds. Sound familiar? “Add ionic mineral drops to your water, as this will hydrate you at the cellular level. It is important for cell turnover and communication sometimes drinking water alone doesn’t cut it.”Take care of your productsDon’t just focus on looking after your complexion – your products need care too. “Active ingredients can be unstable and have an expiration date for a reason out-of-date products aren’t going to perform at their optimum and could even cause skin irritation,” says Pfeffer. “Check how the product should be stored, too – lots of ingredients can be denatured by sunlight so it’s best to keep them in a cool, dark cabinet. What if there’s a textural change or a funny smell? Play it safe and don’t apply.”Use retinol at night“Retinol is an anti-ageing superstar,” says Kerr. “It is a cell communicator that can attach to most skin cells, telling them to behave like younger, healthier versions of themselves.”Retinol is best used at night when the skin is “more active and in repair mode”, adds Kerr. Because retinol is a seriously active ingredient, start slow with a low percentage a few nights a week and work your way up in strength and frequency.Incorporate PHA into your routinePolyhydroxy acids (PHAs) are the new “it” exfoliating acid on the beauty block and because they are gentle, everyone can benefit from them (even if you have sensitive, dry or rosacea-prone skin). “PHAs are humectants, which means they have the ability to attract moisture which hydrates the skin. They also have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits,” says Kerr. “Plus, if used regularly they can strengthen barrier function, making the skin stronger and more resilient, giving you more of that sought-after glow.”Stop applying products in the wrong orderYou need to think about product penetration when applying your skincare. “The biggest mistake I see people make is using a balm or oil cleanser, then applying a water-based serum. Water floats on top of oil – that serum isn’t going anywhere near your skin,” says Kerr. Apply your products from thinnest in consistency to thickest and “always apply sunscreen last”, adds Kerr.Stop over-exfoliatingSkin experts have differing views on this one, but Reynolds doesn’t believe we should be excessively exfoliating. “The skin’s microbiome and lipid barrier can be disrupted by aggressive exfoliating, leading to inflammation,” she says. Aim to exfoliate twice a week. If you feel your skin can handle more, that’s OK, but proceed with some caution.Stop using moisturiserCurveball! “It has been ingrained in us from a young age to cleanse, tone and moisturise. But our skin is capable of maintaining its own hydration levels – only a true dry skin type needs moisturiser,” says Kerr. “When we use moisturiser, our skin’s surface sends a signal down to its water reservoirs that there is plenty of moisture and to halt production. This makes the skin sluggish and lacking in moisture, so we reach for more moisturiser.“Breaking the cycle wakes up the skin’s natural moisturising processes, not only hydrating the skin but helping to balance oil production, preventing congestion. You’ll notice a brightening of the complexion and slower rate of skin ageing.” Give it a go and you should start to see a difference in two to three weeks.Stop ignoring instructions“The biggest mistake is overusing something if it works,” says Reynolds. If that retinol is making your skin glow, then the temptation is to go to town. “Remember, the ingredients in products that give the wow factor can also create an imbalance if over used. Stick to the instructions.”Stop cleansing with oilsBalm and oil cleansers may feel luxurious, but Kerr says “oils congest the skin, upset our own moisturising processes and prevent product penetration”. Not ready to give up your balm or oil cleanser? Be sure to double cleanse to remove any oil residue that could prevent your pricey serums from penetrating.Be your healthy best with Nature’s BountyBeauty starts from within.

From gardening ‘workouts’ to training with Serena Williams, there are ways to be frugal and fitIf getting fit is up there on your 2019 to-do list, then you may be tempted to stump up the cash for a pricey gym membership. Instead, why not explore the fitness workouts you can do for free?When it comes to getting fit, Louise Parker, author of Louise Parker: The 6 Week Programme (£20, Mitchell Beazley) and founder of the Louise Parker Method, believes the route to success is consistency, so, whether or not you’re paying for your workout, bear that in mind. “Stick to a routine, even if the time varies,” says Parker. “I get home, tend to the kids and then it’s yoga mat out for a quick cardio workout and job done. It’s not severe or gruelling, so I never dread it. It’s consistent and so it works.”Luke Worthington, human movement and elite performance specialist, agrees: “As a trainer, one of the most common questions I get asked is: ‘What’s the best programme for *insert goal here*?’ The answer, almost always, is the one that you will stick to. Adherence and consistency (and, therefore, motivation) are the most important considerations when embarking on an exercise regime.”Below are five free workout ideas. All you need to do is commit, workout, then repeat.Running is one of the most affordable ways to get fit. To start with, you really don’t need a lot of expensive kit a pair of running shoes – and, for women, a sports bra – is all you need to get started. If you’re totally new to running, try downloading the C25K 5K Trainer app (iTunes or Android, free), which will get you running the distance in just eight weeks. Once you’ve mastered a 5k, why not seek out your local Parkrun? The free Saturday morning race is timed, so you can keep track of your progress week after week.If you live near the countryside, or you fancy heading off for an active break, then why not seek out the UK’s best hiking routes? Walking is a low-impact exercise – you’re less likely to get injured from a jaunt across the countryside than doing something more intense. You’ll be burning calories and working those muscles, all the while distracted by the scenic views. Head to nationaltrailthe-trails to discover some of the best walking routes our country has to offer.We all know that gym memberships can cost an arm and a leg, and while there are now more affordable options that don’t tie you in, they still involve a monthly outlay. Our Parks offers free workouts, from boxfit and boot camps to yoga and Zumba, in parks up and down the country. Simply set up an online account and book a class near you.If you like the idea of being outside, but you’re not a fan of workout classes, then Green Gym could be for you. It’s a charity organisation that gets volunteers gardening their way to fitness. Each session involves a warm-up and cool down, but the bulk of the “workout” is gardening.Fitness Blender is a website devoted to free workouts of varying lengths and for different abilities – choose from barre, cardio and strength training, plus many more. It’s this decade’s answer to the workout DVD.If you travel a lot and want to exercise on the go, then download the Nike Training Club app (iTunes and Android, free) it’s essentially like having Nike’s best trainers and athletes – such as Serena Williams and Cristiano Ronaldo – in your pocket. It boasts more than 100 workouts, including core strength, abs and arms, and glute toner.Don’t think you have the willpower or motivation to work out at home? Anna Samuels, boxing trainer and the BoxxMethod co-founder suggests treating your at-home workout like you would a gym class or personal training session. “Book out time in your diary to do it, otherwise there is always the risk of putting it off until later. With the right mindset and planning, you will find the motivation to start, and with consistency it will become a habit.”OK, this is slightly unusual, but ecstatic dance – where you move to music in any way you please – frees you from confusing routines so you can lose yourself in the rhythm. You don’t need to head to a pricey class instead, load up Spotify or iTunes with your favourite, energy-boosting tunes and dance like no one’s watching. The benefits? It’s free, it burns calories and can even relieve stress.

However, Semenya’s legal team will argue the natural advantages she derives from being a DSD are no different than those other athletes enjoy.In a statement they added: “Women with differences in sexual development have genetic differences that are no different than other genetic variations that are celebrated in sport. She asks that she be respected and treated as any other athlete. Her genetic gift should be celebrated, not discriminated against.”On Wednesday the IAAF rejected a report suggesting it regarded Semenya as a “biological male”. “The IAAF is not classifying any DSD athlete as male,” it added. “To the contrary, we accept their legal sex without question, and permit them to compete in the female category.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f19b9e7be03d3b4e5c972941e2bf757a84adfc2/1567_155_3089_1854/master/3089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3427a2fa7749bde93fb4967239bcbaf3","title":"mclaren lando norris f1 fernando alonso","story":"Lando Norris, who next month will become the youngest British driver to compete in Formula One, has said he knows he will make mistakes while under the intense scrutiny of his debut season for McLaren. Norris will be 19 at the first grand prix in Melbourne and faces by far the most challenging test of his career as he seeks to make his mark at a team still in the throes of rebuilding after four years of underperformance.Norris and his teammate Carlos Sainz Jr replace Fernando Alonso, who has retired from F1, and Stoffel Vandoorne, who was dropped by McLaren at the end of last season.Vandoorne was a recognised talent but struggled in an uncompetitive car and when measured against Alonso. The task facing Norris is similarly daunting, with Sainz in his fifth season and McLaren with another as yet unproven car, but he does not expect an easy ride.“There’s going to be times when I make mistakes but it’s just knowing that’s part of it,” he said. “No one’s perfect. I’m sure there’s going to be times when I do things wrong that no one’s going to like and everyone’s going to think I’m terrible and rubbish but I know I’m going to go through those times.It’s just understanding that that’s going to happen.“It’s very different when you get to F1 knowing when I make one small mistake a lot more people are going to see it. There’s more pressure in knowing you’re under more scrutiny of making small mistakes.”Norris was speaking at the launch of the McLaren MCL34 at the team’s headquarters in Woking. He joined McLaren as a junior driver in 2017 and was the reserve driver in 2018, taking part in practice at the Belgian GP. He was second in the F2 championship last season and McLaren have high hopes he will be a star, having shown the potential to make it with a string of titles in junior series.Norris will take the wheel of the MCL34 at the first test in Barcelona on Monday and was more than aware of the scale of the challenge that faced him and McLaren. “I’ve spent a lot of time over the winter to try and prepare myself in every way for this moment and for the races,” he said. “But there’s some things you can’t learn until you’re on track and in that situation. The aim is to win races and championships but we have to improve as a team first.”McLaren’s chief executive officer, Zak Brown, acknowledged the team are still undergoing a rebuilding process. They endured three woeful years with an underpowered and unreliable Honda engine until switching to Renault last year. However, optimism of a swift return to the sharp end was crushed when their car proved to have fundamental aerodynamic problems. They finished sixth in the constructors’ standings, flattered by how much Alonso was able to extract from his recalcitrant ride.Brown’s new drivers, especially Norris, are unknown quantities in comparison with Alonso but the American was confident about the British driver’s ability to step up.“Lando is very mature for his age and been in a race car for most of his life,” he said. “He is a relaxed inidual and we think he is ready otherwise we would not put him in the car. I am sure he will make some rookie mistakes but we will be there to support him. I think he will hit the ground running and will be on it right away.”McLaren, who have been restructuring their personnel, are awaiting two major new additions. James Key, who was at Toro Rosso, will join as the technical director at a still undisclosed point in the near future and Andreas Seidl, who was in charge of Porsche’s highly successful world endurance championship team, will become their head of F1 operations on 1 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5072061c5fc950d52fcf4aa8f4f9001d501d8b77/141_314_4362_2616/master/4362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6db623d499dd0ce8b874cc75517d8473","title":"from pagan russia to vodou ritual haiti explosive rite of spring jeanguy saintus stravinsky","story":"When Jeanguy Saintus first saw Stravinsky’s Rite, he was reminded of his religion’s initiation ceremonies. Now, he has created his own spirited version of the balletSince its infamous premiere in 1913, there have been many reimaginings of the NijinskyStravinsky ballet The Rite of Spring, but never before as a vodou initiation ceremony. Forget sticking pins in dolls and other horror-film cliches, vodou – not voodoo, note – is “a religion like any other”, says choreographer Jeanguy Saintus, a practising vodouist and the man who powers contemporary dance in Haiti with his company Ayikodans.Saintus draws on the rituals of vodou in his first UK commission, for Leeds-based Phoenix Dance Theatre. His Rite of Spring will be performed in a double bill with Opera North, accompanied by their orchestra. Saintus was tentative at first, having never worked with a classical orchestra, but he felt a surprising link between this story of pagan Russia (the ritual sacrifice of a “chosen” girl to the gods of the harvest), and the roots of his own culture.In Saintus’s Rite, the loa appear: Damballa, the serpent and creator of life, Ogoun, the warrior and Marassa, the ine twins. I watch the dancers in the studio perform full-bodied choreography, with rippling port de bras, powerful poses and an exhausting climax of jolting bodies. Saintus wasn’t on board with the idea of a sacrifice, so his Rite ends with a man being possessed by a female spirit in a takeback of power. He created the work with the dancers, telling them stories about his religion, but he is insistent on not being prescriptive about what people should see. “If you don’t know vodou, you will see dance,” he says.He doesn’t want people to come with preconceptions of Haitian culture, either. “When people hear ‘Haiti’, it’s always about poverty and the earthquake, and they are like, ‘Do they dance in Haiti?’ Someone asked me that, he couldn’t understand that someone could be training in classical ballet in Port-au-Prince.” Saintus was, it’s true, the only boy at his ballet school. (“In Haiti, men don’t dance.”) But he never had any doubt about his calling. “I think I was born a dancer,” he says. His mother died when he was 14 (he didn’t meet his father until he was in his 20s). “I’m pretty sure she would love the end result, but I don’t know if when I was 14 she would be that open to me going to dance school.” His community’s attitudes did not stop him though. “I have a strong character, I can say that.”After ballet school in Haiti, Saintus travelled in the US and Caribbean taking all kinds of classes: modern dance, Afro-Brazilian. He had a kind of photographic memory – he could watch a class or performance and remember every step. (“Now I’m too old to do that,” he says, at 54.) His education also came from assisting at vodou ceremonies. “People are dancing beautifully and they don’t even know it,” he says. “I remember that a woman was possessed and she went down to the ground, rolling and contracting. Sometimes you are at a ceremony and you don’t want to be possessed, so when you feel like something is coming, you leave the room.” One man was heading for the door when suddenly his body flexed into a deep backbend. “I’m pretty sure that in his life this man could never do a backbend, but those are the type of things I’ve discovered.”Despite not wanting to dwell on Haiti’s problems, we inevitably talk about the 2010 earthquake. “I was driving at the time,” says Saintus, “going to see a documentary on Martha Graham. I was in the right-hand lane, when I had the feeling that something put the car all the way to the other side. I’ve never lived any experience like that. I had to leave my car downtown in Port-au-Prince and walk 10km home. I thought the school would be destroyed, but only part had collapsed.”They rebuilt the studio in 2013. Generally, on the island, recovery has been slow. “They stole all the money,” says Saintus. “So, recovery? I don’t know. They gave the money to institutions, certain big foundations took all the money.”There’s little funding for the arts in Haiti, but Saintus seems able to make things happen that less determined people might not. “It’s a blessing that I was chosen to be a dancer,” he says. “And being in Haiti it is also a mission. So many times you ask yourself: why am I doing this? Because there is no support. But I feel I have a responsibility to keep dance alive. To take dance to a different level. We can do a lot with dance, and it can be a very good tool for peace.” Do you really think so? I ask him. “Yes!” he’s emphatic. “Did you see the beauty of the dancers in the studio? Just imagine if everybody was dancing,” he says. “Just imagine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f9c999bf1645f91ec572440adf4b320583390ae/2_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79291db2268fb9d7141efc2081bd5abf","title":"my funny valentine standups on their most disastrous dates","story":"A night in a cemetery, a trip to a strip club, five hours in A\u0026ampE … comics relive their woeful romantic rendezvousOn my year abroad in Paris – the city of love – I went on, if not an official date, then a two-person “rendezvous” where I was almost certainly harbouring more romantic aspirations than my opposite number. We elected, foolishly, to watch the film Buried, about an American truck-driver (Ryan Reynolds) in Iraq who spends the film imprisoned in a coffin. The only sliver of hope for this claustrophobic nightmare of a cinema experience would have been a mutual clasp of terror during one of the white-knuckle moments (the snake? the sand? Ryan’s phone running out of battery?). Alas, due to our late arrival at the Gaumont Parnasse, my companion sat not next to me but one row in front. And someone kicked over my popcorn. A dismal failure on every front.During the last Edinburgh fringe, I met a flyerer and we had a fun initial chat. We both had an hour to kill and she asked if I wanted to get a bite to eat. I went “Sure” and she said “OK, do you want to come back to my place?” I was a bit taken aback but it seemed innocent enough so I went along with it. When I got there, she reheated some pasta, we ate and then she started kissing me. She quickly stopped and said: “Sorry, I’m not into this.” So I left and we never spoke again. This all took place within an hour of meeting.We had worked together one summer, and ran into each other one Friday night. We went for drinks and everything was fine, until he shushed me and started listening intensely to the music. It was Madonna or something. Then he smiled and said: “Sorry, it’s just that I communicate with God through music. Carry on.” He told me his powers came from his mother’s cats and that he believed all people were cats or dogs. “You’re obviously a dog,” he said with a big, caring smile. He wanted to win The X Factor. “Do you sing?” I asked. “No,” he said. “But I’ve never cried before and I can only cry if I win The X Factor. I’d love to try crying.” I still don’t know if he was trying to be funny or not. Either way, he never texted me back.Edinburgh festival, 2012. She was flirty and pretty in a girl-next-door way (if the girl next door was really fit). She came to my show, said she loved it and suggested a drink the next night. We had several – laughing, chatting, sharing a fag. The bar was closing but she knew somewhere else. Brilliant! A jazz club. I’ve never been into jazz but I could be tonight. I’ve always been awkward on dates but I was smashing this one. As I walked her home, we shared an umbrella. (Since I was a teenager I’ve thought rain is romantic because of a kissing scene in Ally McBeal I remember thinking: “Imagine wanting to kiss someone so much you didn’t mind your hair getting wet.”) At her house, we gazed into each other’s eyes. Then she broke the silence. “This was amazing. You’re the perfect date. If I was gay, you’d be the one.” Ah … not a date after all.I was 13 and Nick from my drama group invited me to see Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones. Remember it? It’s the one that was extra shit and in which Anakin refers to child jedis as “younglings”. I brought my best friend Libby with me, as was the Year 9 way, and we just took the piss out of the film, not saying a word to poor Nick. Afterwards a friend texted me on my Nokia brick to inform me something I needed to know about Nick. It turns out he wasn’t 13 at all – he was 12. Twelve! I felt lost, betrayed and humiliated. This Year 8 kid had lied to me and it was over. The experience taught me everything I now know about love: ask to see ID before going to the latest Star Wars instalment, or girl you gonna get burned.This date was disastrous thanks to me and only me. While at university, I fancied myself a real manic pixie dream girl – so when a lovely young man asked me out, I decided to inject it with as much whimsy as humanly possible. First, I demanded he drive us to a cemetery, because I wanted to be quirky but in a goth way. It turned out to be much sadder than the Smiths made it seem, so we got back into his car. After that, I asked him to drive us to a strip club. There, he tried his best to maintain eye contact with me as a beautiful woman approached us offering a lap dance. He politely said “I’m good”, to which the beautiful woman responded with a shrug: “I’m better.” Later we made out in his car.Once upon a time, there was a little, ginger, camp comedian who had just finished a Soho theatre run and was ready to find The One. He searched far and wide (OK, I went into Soho after my gig) and met a boy. He looked like Aladdin, we exchanged numbers. Days later, I was invited to his house (a warehouse in east London, and he was vegan – I should have known). The conversation was great, he was a little eccentric and wore a kimono but I just thought: “Take what you can get.” He took me into his “special room” and there was a bed of nails. He said they were for chiropractic – a likely story! I was dying to leave but the Uber surge charge was on. So I hopped on and I’ve not quite been the same since.When I was an awkward 18-year-old, all low self-esteem and Nirvana T-shirts, I met a friend of a friend in the pub. He had dark curly hair and lovely eyes, so when he asked me to go out with him, I was over the moon. I gave him my number (by which I mean the landline at my mum’s house) and steeled myself for a week of sitting by a phone that never rang. But it did. The next day. He was having a party at his house on Saturday night. Would I like to go along as his date? He lived in a village out of town so would come and pick me up. (He had a car! OK, it was his mum’s Nissan Micra, but it was a car!) I was so excited – a date and a house party. We made awkward small talk as he drove me to his parents’ house in the country. I thought: how cool must your parents be to just let you have a party in their massive house? We arrived, and I was greeted at the front door by said parents. Both of them. It was their 25th-anniversary party, where I was to be paraded and introduced to his entire family. I couldn’t escape – I didn’t even know where I was – so I had to smile sweetly and wait for him to drive me home.Never date someone older than your dad. Never date a drug addict. Never date someone you meet in a lift. These were the golden rules my mum told me. I broke all of them two years ago. He told me “You make me feel impossible” and quoted a Stephen King book at me. I assumed it was true love. We arranged to meet at 7pm. He was 45 minutes late. He told me he had been stopping a fight. This turned out to be a lie. He had gone to the cinema on his own to see Paddington and got the timings wrong. He wore Crocs, army shorts and a Robbie Williams Let Me Entertain You tour T-shirt. It was a Friday in December. He resembled a serial killer from Luther.We went to a hipster restaurant where he talked about his brother’s orce, his dead relatives and his acute IBS – all while taking out a lot of aggression on the bread sticks. After he asked if I had “ever considered getting checked for Marfan syndrome”, I stood to make a dignified exit. Instead, I banged my head on a decorative shelf and started bleeding from my head. As I bled all over my dress, the table, the food and my dignity, much like Sissy Spacek in Carrie, I also managed to bleed on his clothes. I apologised. He said there was nothing to apologise for. A week later he sent me a receipt for the dry cleaning.I was 15 and my boyfriend and I were in a posh spa for Valentine’s day. After some heavy petting in the deep end, I needed a widdle and because it was a nice place, I thought I would use the toilet. I sauntered off as sassily as I could in my mum’s ill-fitting Aztec-print bikini, through a door up some stairs. I was following my nose to the toilet because, like a fox (or rat), I work on instinct. I opened a fire door, which locked closed behind me and I took in my surroundings. I was in a five-star restaurant where people were busy eating Sunday lunch. There I was stuck like a fox (or rat) in the headlights: a dripping-wet, apologetic, bikini-clad rat. I did the walk of shame through to the other end of the restaurant, out the front door and back into reception. Hiya!When we first met, my girlfriend was living in Bristol. Early in our relationship, we walked to the beautiful suburb of Clifton for lunch it was all dappled sunlight and gentle breeze. Things were going tremendously well until the end of the meal, when my face and hands began dramatically swelling. My breathing was normal, I was merely beginning to inflate like Violet Beauregarde (but still brown). Once we had acquired deflationary drugs, detective work was in order. It turned out that the multivitamins I had started taking contained small amounts of krill oil. It also turns out that I am allergic to krill. Like a shit whale. If you want a date to go perfectly, avoid spending the preceding week microdosing yourself with poison while telling anyone who’ll listen that you’re “on a health kick”.We were just winding up the date when he broke his arm. My friend had arranged a blind date for me with her work colleague. There had been no spark of romance, I had to foot the whole bill and he told me I looked fatter in real life than on TV. We were just about to part ways (reasonably) amicably at the tube when he decided to vault over the barrier. The tube staff were really kind and sympathetic considering he was a felon, and called an ambulance. They assumed we were boyfriend and girlfriend and I felt obliged to go with him. I stayed with him for five hours in A\u0026ampE until he was discharged. I would love to be a time traveller so I could go back to 2002 and tell my younger self to leave before coffee.When I was 18 I had an all-consuming crush on a boy who was also a very close pal. We were already very comfortable talking about romantic relationships, just never the one we were clearly meant to have. I decided I had to tell him and invited him over to my place. I went to make us some tea and returned with two mugs on a tray. As he took a mug, I said: “I really, really like you.” The mug stopped in mid-air. Wordlessly, eyes glued to the mug, he replaced it on the tray, turned on his heel and walked out the front door. Summer holidays started the next day. I didn’t see him again until we were 24 and he was a last-minute passenger in a car I was driving on a road trip. But that’s another story.Did You Hear About the Morgans? Not a question. That’s the name of the film I saw when I was ditched halfway through a date. I was 18 and on one of my first ever romantic outings. My date (let’s call him Liam … like his parents did) invited me to see it. I was on my best behaviour. I don’t even think we spoke that much but I thought everything was going great. Then the film started … Sarah Jessica Parker attempted a character that wasn’t Carrie Bradshaw and “Liam” (real name) had to go to the bathroom. It was the longest bathroom break ever because it’s still going, apparently.I came of age in the 90s. Back then, you just fell on someone in a nightclub. Dating came later. I joined a dating website a couple of years ago and got chatting to a nice woman. She was quite a bit younger than me but happy to come to my local. When I arrived, she had pushed two armchairs together and had bought not one, but two bottles of wine. I had to be up for the school run. After a few minutes she said: “You snogged my cousin at the Edinburgh festival’ ARGH! Obviously, her cousin did not respect the law of “what happens at the fringe, stays at the fringe”. At Edinburgh, I’m 90s-me again. All other times, I’m a tired fortysomething. There was no second date.I used to watch people go on dates on Sex and the City and think: what are they doing? I didn’t have that sort of life. I used to sleep with people and work backwards: if you can tolerate them in the morning, you might get towards a relationship. I thought dates were like auditions, and I went on those and they were shit. But there was a time when I’d been single for a while so I appealed to a friend to set me up on a blind date. We had a nice evening, he was funny and interesting, but there wasn’t any spark. He was a playwright and was doing a production and offered me a part in it. I ended up snogging one of the other cast members and taking him home with me. He’s now my husband."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8aed182c9ed4504c6046ed00c322ea3492c93798/0_57_5106_3063/master/5106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73d362c65262bf7c3d7912f89cc0681e","title":"elon musk backed ai writes convincing news fiction","story":"The Elon Musk-backed nonprofit company OpenAI declines to release research publicly for fear of misuseThe creators of a revolutionary AI system that can write news stories and works of fiction – dubbed “deepfakes for text” – have taken the unusual step of not releasing their research publicly, for fear of potential misuse.OpenAI, an nonprofit research company backed by Elon Musk, says its new AI model, called GPT2 is so good and the risk of malicious use so high that it is breaking from its normal practice of releasing the full research to the public in order to allow more time to discuss the ramifications of the technological breakthrough. At its core, GPT2 is a text generator. The AI system is fed text, anything from a few words to a whole page, and asked to write the next few sentences based on its predictions of what should come next. The system is pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible, both in terms of the quality of the output, and the wide variety of potential uses.When used to simply generate new text, GPT2 is capable of writing plausible passages that match what it is given in both style and subject. It rarely shows any of the quirks that mark out previous AI systems, such as forgetting what it is writing about midway through a paragraph, or mangling the syntax of long sentences.Feed it the opening line of George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four – “It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen” – and the system recognises the vaguely futuristic tone and the novelistic style, and continues with:“I was in my car on my way to a new job in Seattle. I put the gas in, put the key in, and then I let it run. I just imagined what the day would be like. A hundred years from now. In 2045, I was a teacher in some school in a poor part of rural China. I started with Chinese history and history of science.”Feed it the first few paragraphs of a  story about Brexit, and its output is plausible newspaper prose, replete with “quotes” from Jeremy Corbyn, mentions of the Irish border, and answers from the prime minister’s spokesman.One such, completely artificial, paragraph reads: “Asked to clarify the reports, a spokesman for May said: ‘The PM has made it absolutely clear her intention is to leave the EU as quickly as is possible and that will be under her negotiating mandate as confirmed in the Queen’s speech last week.’” From a research standpoint, GPT2 is groundbreaking in two ways. One is its size, says Dario Amodei, OpenAI’s research director. The models “were 12 times bigger, and the dataset was 15 times bigger and much broader” than the previous state-of-the-art AI model. It was trained on a dataset containing about 10m articles, selected by trawling the social news site Reddit for links with more than three votes. The vast collection of text weighed in at 40 GB, enough to store about 35,000 copies of Moby Dick.The amount of data GPT2 was trained on directly affected its quality, giving it more knowledge of how to understand written text. It also led to the second breakthrough. GPT2 is far more general purpose than previous text models. By structuring the text that is input, it can perform tasks including translation and summarisation, and pass simple reading comprehension tests, often performing as well or better than other AIs that have been built specifically for those tasks.That quality, however, has also led OpenAI to go against its remit of pushing AI forward and keep GPT2 behind closed doors for the immediate future while it assesses what malicious users might be able to do with it. “We need to perform experimentation to find out what they can and can’t do,” said Jack Clark, the charity’s head of policy. “If you can’t anticipate all the abilities of a model, you have to prod it to see what it can do. There are many more people than us who are better at thinking what it can do maliciously.”To show what that means, OpenAI made one version of GPT2 with a few modest tweaks that can be used to generate infinite positive – or negative – reviews of products. Spam and fake news are two other obvious potential downsides, as is the AI’s unfiltered nature . As it is trained on the internet, it is not hard to encourage it to generate bigoted text, conspiracy theories and so on.Instead, the goal is to show what is possible to prepare the world for what will be mainstream in a year or two’s time. “I have a term for this. The escalator from hell,” Clark said. “It’s always bringing the technology down in cost and down in price. The rules by which you can control technology have fundamentally changed.“We’re not saying we know the right thing to do here, we’re not laying down the line and saying ‘this is the way’ … We are trying to develop more rigorous thinking here. We’re trying to build the road as we travel across it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc6f85e4c73361c99f2230d037e12c1b192be15f/0_124_1840_1104/master/1840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf39efe6b5a2ec4c76a994b7b482abdf","title":"venice bibione beach is the first in italy to ban smoking","story":"Ban to take effect at the end of May after years of trials and research into air pollution at the Veneto seaside resortThe Venetian seaside resort of Bibione will be the first Italian beach to go completely smoke-free, in a mission to safeguard the environment from discarded cigarette ends and protect visitors from secondhand smoke.The decision comes after eight years of trials, as part of the Breathe the Sea Air project, which saw an initial smoking ban between the first row of umbrellas to the water’s edge. New measures, to be imposed by the end of May, will include designated smoking areas 300 to 400 metres away from the sea, at the edge of the beach. Details regarding fines and whether e-cigarettes are to be permitted will be published in May.Cigarettes filters, which contain slow-degrading plastic cellulose acetate, can take up to 10 years to decompose. Approximately 5.5 trillion cigarettes are sold worldwide each year, with a vast number of the ends discarded into the surrounding environment. As part of the trials between 2014 and 2018, 550,000 cigarette ends were collected on Bibione beach, which would have otherwise ended up in the sand or sea.“We’re interested in giving the people who choose to spend their holidays here the chance to breathe the clean sea air without having to put up with polluting substances that are harmful to health,” said Pasqualino Codognotto, mayor of San Michele al Tagliamento-Bibione. “It is also a way of working alongside our guests to promote a culture based on respect, and we are confident that non-smokers and smokers will seize the opportunity that it presents. The initiative also has the backing of all of the members of the local tourist industry.”Scientific research used to support the move included a report from the Stop Smoking Centre at the Italian National Tumour Institute in Milan, which measured air pollution on and around Bibione beach. It found peaks in pollution levels from cigarettes even from a distance of 10 metres from smokers, and that even though peaks only lasted a few seconds, levels were higher than at the busy roundabout at the resort entrance. The average black carbon measurement (tiny, toxic pollution particles) from when a cigarette was lit until it was put out was 7.4 microgramsm³, compared with 2.1 at the roundabout and 1.8 on the beach overall.Other places that have already introduced a ban include Queensland, Australia, on all its patrolled beaches more than 300 beaches across the US and as of 2018 24 beaches in Thailand, including Patong beach in Phuket and Bo Phut on Koh Samui. Two Welsh beaches have introduced voluntary bans – Little Haven in Pembrokeshire and Caswell Bay in Swansea.Italy imposed a smoking ban in public enclosed places in 2005, prohibiting smoking in bars, restaurants, clubs and offices. The European commission has called several times for a ban on smoking in public areas, including urging member counties in 2017 to put policies in place to make public spaces, including beaches, smoke-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d000a74d7ebcc277f2c6f494737d4e9d2e4a79c/0_84_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a23dc6ae1869a4486e1a5dd2dd4849f","title":"colorado jogger recounts ordeal with mountain lion","story":"Travis Kauffman recounts encounter that left the cat dead and him with 28 stitches and a reputation for braveryWhen a young mountain lion clamped its jaws onto the wrist of a Colorado trail runner and clawed at his face, Travis Kauffman screamed out a “barbarian yell,” and jammed his right foot onto the animal’s neck, holding it there until he ultimately prevailed in a fight for survival.After a couple of minutes, Kauffmann recalled Thursday, “it finally stopped moving and then the jaws opened and I was able to kind of scramble back up the hill and get the heck out of Dodge.”Through it all, Kauffman recalled, the cat remained eerily silent.It was the first time Kauffman, 31, publicly recounted the 4 February ordeal that left the cat dead and him with 28 stitches and a reputation for toughness and bravery that belies his wiry frame.“I will never be able to live up to the reputation,” said Kauffman, who stands 5ft 10in (1.5 meters) and weighs about 150lb (70kg). “The story is bigger than my puny form.”Kauffman said he was running a trail in the mountains west of Fort Collins when he heard pine needles rustle behind him. He turned to see the mountain lion about 10ft (3 meters) away.“One of my worst fears was confirmed,” he said.That cat lunged. Kauffman raised his hands and screamed, “doing my barbarian yell,” he said.The animal locked its teeth onto his wrist and they tumbled off the side of the trail.A wave of fear rolled over him, he said, and he worried that the animal’s full-grown mother would join the attack to defend her offspring, but no other cat appeared.Fear then gave way to the fighting instinct, he said.Kauffman grabbed a rock with his free hand and beat the cat on the back of the head. He also tried stabbing it with twigs, but nothing worked.“I knew with two pretty good blows to the back of the head (and) it didn’t release, that I was probably going to have to do something a little more drastic,” he said. “I was able to kind of shift my weight and get a foot on its neck” until it succumbed.Bleeding from his face and wrist, he jogged back down the trail, where he met other runners who got him to a hospital.Colorado Parks and Wildlife officers retrieved the dead cat. They said their investigation and a necropsy confirmed Kauffman’s account.“Travis is a pretty amazing young man,” said Ty Petersburg, a wildlife manager for the agency.Petersburg said officers set up cameras and traps in the area for several days after the attack. They saw no large mountain lions but captured two young ones in good health. He said both are in a rehabilitation center and the agency hopes to release them back into the wild.Kauffman, who described himself as an avid runner and skier, doesn’t plan to retreat from the outdoors.“I will go run those trails again,” he said, but added, “I will go with a buddy there.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c05c2d266242fd22f4dd662fab59c1f5ef268bd/53_0_2193_1316/master/2193.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e10df6b03ba85d2ab354b919649fa6eb","title":"craggy island for sale gulls grass wind and no mod cons","story":"Uninhabited High Island off the west coast of Ireland can be yours for £1.1mA craggy island off the west coast of Ireland which was home to iron age settlers, medieval monks and a poet in search of inspiration has gone on sale for €1.25m (£1.1m).High Island, an 80-acre swath of rock, heather and wind probably too remote even for Father Ted, sits in the Atlantic two miles off the coast of Galway.After 3,000 years of on-off human settlement it is now uninhabited and awaiting a buyer who has their own transport, preferably a robust dinghy or helicopter.“It’s lovely, a beautiful place,” said Luke Spencer, of Spencer Auctioneers, which has listed High Island on the property site MyHome.ie. “A lot of birds and grasses and ferns. You’ve got Atlantic views all the way around.”Since going on the market last Friday it has received more than 7,000 views, said the auctioneer. “That’s massive.”Star Wars fans should note that High Island – Ardoileán in Irish – is a good 200 miles north of the Skellig Islands, rocky outcrops off County Kerry which served as Luke Skywalker’s sanctuary.The island, about the size of 60 football fields, rises to 206 feet above sea level at its centre and slopes down to cliffs and deep inlets.It includes two freshwater lakes and a host of birds: gulls, fulmars, Arctic terns, Manx shearwaters, barnacle geese, petrels, oystercatchers and peregrine falcons, making the island an EU special protection area.Pollen evidence suggests there was human settlement about 3,000 years ago. Archaeologists believe monks converted a secular settlement into a monastery in the seventh century. It was reputedly founded by Saint Féchín, who founded other monasteries across Ireland until succumbing to yellow fever in 665.The monastery’s ruins, which include a church, altar, beehive huts and graves, are owned by the Irish state and excluded from the sale.A prominent Galway family, the Martins, owned the island in the 18th century and leased it to copper miners, who built stone huts and left a mineshaft.Richard Murphy, a poet who lived on the nearby island of Inishbofin, owned it from 1969 to 1998.“I got excited at the thought of buying this inaccessible holy island, restoring the beehive cells and oratory of its derelict hermitage and preserving the place from destruction,” he wrote in his memoir, The Kick.Visits to the island influenced some of his poems. According to Tim Robinson, author of a trilogy about Galway’s Connemara region, weather deterred Murphy from long visits. “After one spell of five days during which he saw the sun for 20 minutes he gave up spending more than a few hours there at a time.”Murphy sold High Island to a friend, Féichin Mulkerrin, who is now selling it.Spencer said the place was not all howling wind and darkness. “When we visited we had a stunning day out there.

Its excavation has been possible in the context of the broader intervention of stabilisation and re-profiling of the excavation fronts, overseen by the Great Pompeii Project.”The ancient city of Pompeii was destroyed in AD79 by an eruption that killed more than 2,000 people. The ruins have become one of the most visited archaeological sites in the world.The city, which attracts almost 4 million visitors a year, has come a long way since 2013, when Unesco threatened to place it on its list of world heritage sites in peril unless Italian authorities improved its preservation.On 16 October, archaeologists discovered an engraving that suggested the eruption occurred in October of AD79, and not August, as had been previously thought.Surprises unearthed in recent months include the remains of a horse and a home with an elaborate shrine."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3794223.1550167451!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"parents need to learn higher education is not the only measure of success","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMany colleges have low minimum entry requirements for what are often highly demanding courses. Photograph: Getty Images Parents need to be challenged over their belief that higher education is the “only measure of success” for school-leavers, the head of a national education body has warned.Nessa White, general secretary of Education and Training Boards Ireland, was responding to the findings of a study which show alarming dropout rates among students in some computing and engineering courses with low CAO entry points.For example, the Higher Education Authority study shows some engineering courses at IT Blanchardstown had drop-out rates of up to 89 per cent, while some computing courses at the same college had non-completion rates of up to 83 per cent.Some educationalists have questioned whether too many students feel compelled to go to college, even though they may flourish with more hands-on options such as further education or apprenticeships.“The findings of the report provide stark evidence that we may not be getting this right for the students and learners of Ireland,” Ms White said.“The findings also provide us with an opportunity to challenge the conditioning parents have that the only measure of success is that your child progresses to third level education.She said Education and Training Boards (ETBs) – which run further education colleges – provide many options to ensure progression in a person-centred way that help ensure students can reach their full potential.“The challenge for us as education providers is to ensure a seamless two-way flow between further and higher education providers,” she said,“This can be achieved through strategic collaborations between ETBs and higher education providers. The establishment of technological universities provides an excellent opportunity to think differently in this space.”The issue of minimum entry requirements for third-level courses has also come under the spotlight as a result of the Higher Education Authority’s report findings.Students with low CAO points are much more likely to struggle, especially where they have poor maths or English grades in the Leaving Cert.However, many colleges have low minimum entry requirements for what are often highly demanding courses.When asked whether its entry requirements will change, IT Blanchardstown – now part of the Technological University Dublin – said the report’s findings were based on a single cohort of students who started college in 2007-2008.“Ensuring pathways to qualification are open to students at all levels from apprenticeship to postgraduate – with exit points as appropriate – is key to the ethos of TU Dublin,” a spokeswoman said,“We want to see all of our students achieve their goals to the best of their ability and we continually review all of the factors that may be relevant to successful completion – academic, social and economic.”She said student supports such as enhanced orientation programmes, peer mentoring, maths learning centres and academic writing centres were available to help those at risk of struggling.Linda Keane, the Irish Computer Society’s strategy and operations manager, said one of the factors behind high drop-out rates may be a poor understanding of the demands of computer science courses.“While these are certainly very valuable skills in themselves they are absolutely not computer science.”She said these courses required good problem-solving skills, computational thinking and good level of maths.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3794483.1550182104!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no time frame for new sligo garda station","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTony McLoughlin: “I have been raising this every week with the Minister and the OPW, and, indeed, before that with the previous minister Frances Fitzgerald”Over a year after rank-and-file gardaí in Sligo walked out of their station in protest at conditions there, the Minister for Justice has admitted to local TDs that there is still no time frame for the construction of a new regional headquarters.Local Fine Gael TD and Government assistant whip Tony McLoughlin said he was “disappointed that the process was taking so long”, while Fianna Fáil’s Marc MacSharry said the project was obviously “on the never never”.A new site for the Sligo station, which will replace a building dating back to the mid-1800s, was purchased last year, but no progress has been made on the project.Mr McLoughlin said he “certainly hoped” that the fallout from the escalating budget for the new children’s hospital would not impact on the plan.“I have been raising this every week with the Minister and the OPW, and, indeed, before that with the previous minister Frances Fitzgerald. ” He said that while conditions at the existing station, which were described as “third world” in late 2017, had since improved, it was vital that the construction of the new station be progressed as quickly as possible. “The existing station was never fit for purpose, in my opinion.” Mr McLoughlin said he was aware of speculation about the fallout from the children’s hospital overrun, but “I certainly hope that will not impact the new Sligo station which is not just for Sligo but for the region. We have been given a commitment.” Fire-safety issuesIn late 2017, frontline gardaí walked out of the station following an independent report which highlighted fire-safety issues and other problems such as rodent infestation .Local GRA representative Ray Wims said gardaí had been given a commitment by Garda management and the Minister that the project would proceed and respected that. “However, in the absence of a verifiable time frame that confidence will erode.” In response to parliamentary questions, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation was being progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works (OPW).He said that a public-private-partnership (PPP) arrangement was intended to deliver new stations at Sligo, Clonmel, Co Tipperary, and Macroom, Co Cork, and that site acquisition for this PPP bundle has been “complex and time-consuming”. The Minister said it was not possible to provide a time frame for the completion of these projects, but delivery of the three stations was being pursued “as a priority”. UnacceptableThe delay was described as “totally unacceptable” by Mr MacSharry. “We know Minister Ross manages to prioritise his voters in Stepaside which gardaí admitted was not a priority at the Public Accounts Committee, but the people of Co Sligo are ignored by his Fine Gael colleagues.” In a statement the OPW confirmed that a site had been purchased at Caltragh , Sligo, in May 2018, and the development of the station would be progressed under the auspices of the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA)."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3794311.1550171452!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shouting match in d%C3%A1il as ring says mcgrath like a dog always scratching","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Independent deputy Mattie McGrath   hit out at Government Ministers appointing ‘spin doctors’ and ‘yet the Government is telling the nurses it cannot pay them’.

We now know that Neanderthals are our closest ancestor and probably interbred with humans. File photograph: Sebastian WillnowAFPGetty ImagesWhen you imagine a Neanderthal you probably think of the classic image of the “cave man”: heavy brow, monkey-like face, stooping posture, shaggy hair, holding a big club. Although this is not how most scientists imagine Neanderthals today (have a look at http:www.nhm.ac.ukdiscoverwho-were-the-neanderthals.html), the early images were based on observed characteristics of Neanderthal skeletal remains. An Irish-based scientist, the geologist William King, had an important role in interpreting these remains and even provided the name Homo neanderthalensis to express his belief that they were the remains of a new species of hominid similar to, but distinct from, modern humans.The position of Neanderthals in the ancestral tree of Homo sapiens has been a subject of debate since the first skull was discovered in Germany in 1856. Since then, fragments of more than 500 iniduals have been discovered. Scientists have asked questions about Neanderthal language and cognition, about Neanderthal tools, about Neanderthal burial practices and beliefs. Perhaps the most furious debate has concerned their relationship to fully modern humans. After the Neanderthal genome was sequenced in 2010, the debate has focused on how much interbreeding occurred between communities of Neanderthals and of Homo sapiens in Europe. In short, what percentage of our DNA did we get from Neanderthals? Before genome sequencing, scientists could only use their knowledge of comparative anatomy to determine the relationship between fossilised remains and living organisms. Using a cast of a skull cap and the descriptions of other Neanderthal skeletal remains written by other scientists, King asserted that the remains found in the Neander valley were different enough from modern humans to form a new species.King, originally from Sunderland, had been appointed a professor of geology at one of the newly opened Queen’s Colleges in 1849. The controversial “non-denominational” colleges were the precursors of NUI Galway, University College Cork and Queen’s University Belfast and aimed to increase the opportunities for Ireland’s middle classes to access higher education. The colleges were particularly forward thinking in their focus on scientific instruction. Isolated in Galway with few students but with a good laboratory and access to the ever-increasing scientific periodical press, King ranged widely across many sciences we might now consider separate. Most geologists today would think twice about debating the comparative anatomy of modern humans, chimpanzees and ancient remains. Yet when King obtained a cast of the unusual German skull cap, he compared it with a variety of other skulls (using both a collection of objects and descriptions in scientific papers) and concluded that the skull was so different from modern humans as to constitute a new species. Before King’s contribution, the predominant view was that the Neanderthal might be a deformed or diseased human. King dismissed this idea with the suggestion that even the most degraded and “inferior” human races (as King believed races other than Europeans to be) showed a more spherical skull and a higher forehead than the Neanderthal skull cap suggested. During the 19th century, a high forehead was believed to indicate superior intelligence. Australian Aborigines were most Europeans’ favourite example of a supposedly “degraded” and “savage” race and King believed that even their skulls showed more similarity to modern humans than the Neanderthal skull. In short, the Neanderthal skull’s “strong simial tendencies” led King to believe that it was simply too different from humans to be of the same species. In his 1864 paper for the Quarterly Journal of Science he even proposed in a foonote that “I now feel strongly inclined to believe that it is not only specifically but generically distinct from Man”. That is, not a member of the genus Homo. It is hard for us to recapture the shock value of King’s ideas in asserting the existence of another species of human-like creatures at a time when the Biblical version of creation was widely considered an accurate description of the Earth’s history.Things have come almost full circle from King’s time: we now know that Neanderthals are our closest ancestor and probably interbred with humans. Yet what has remained curiously consistent is our belief that Neanderthals were inferior to modern humans, although the explanations have changed. Rather than the absence of a high forehead, scientists now refer to the absence of some kind of genetic adaptation that enabled Homo sapiens to create more advanced societies and out-compete their shorter, stockier neighbours.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3794451.1550179896!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit no incentive for eu to move as may loses another vote","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May is driven out of the Houses of Parliament after losing a vote on her Brexit withdrawal Bill. Photograph: Niklas Halle’nAFPGetty ImagesTheresa May could have presented MPs on Thursday with a neutral motion that simply took note of her statement on the Brexit negotiations earlier this week. Instead the UK prime minister asked them to reiterate their support for “the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this House on January 29th”.It must have seemed like a clever idea at the time, but if there is one thing the conspiracy theorists in the Brexiteer European Research Group (ERG) are good at, it’s spotting conspiracies. They understood that the motion could be interpreted not only as a reaffirmation of their demand for changes to the Northern Ireland backstop but also as a rejection of a no-deal Brexit in line with another amendment passed on January 29th.The DUP voted with the government, a smart move that tells the government that its 10 votes are available for a Brexit deal as long as the prime minister keeps her promise to secure changes to the backstop. It has the additional merit of warning the government that if the DUP is not satisfied with a renegotiated deal, it will vote against it rather than abstaining.Some leading figures in the ERG were reluctant to be seen to be responsible for the government’s defeat but their decision to abstain rather than vote against the motion did nothing to blunt their action. The Brexiteers have weakened May’s negotiating hand in Europe and diminished her chances of winning the concessions on the backstop that they are demanding.Freak phenomenonFor the EU, Thursday’s vote is confirmation that last month’s majority for the Brady amendment was a freak phenomenon and that the will of the House of Commons remains unsettled. EU negotiators have no incentive to offer any concessions to the UK ahead of a vote on February 27th, when MPs will be able to back an amendment that would force the government to seek an extension to the article 50 negotiating period.As Conservative former minister Oliver Letwin told the House on Thursday, such an extension would offer MPs an opportunity to seek a consensus approach to Brexit. Such a consensus would almost certainly embrace a permanent customs union and possibly single-market membership.Such a deal would be in the EU’s economic interest and would ease the difficulties Brexit creates for the Border, and Thursday’s vote will persuade EU leaders that it remains a possibility. While such hope is alive, why pass any concession on the backstop across the table to May, knowing that she will toss it into the furnace of the Conservative backbenches?Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

From finding love to toppling corrupt governments, this multi-billion dollar industry – with sharing as its organising principle – can be a force for good.As a former science and innovation minister, I know we are only at the start of this technological revolution. And I want Britain to be the go‑to place in Europe where digital platforms – including social media and messaging behemoths like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Tinder – can flourish.But that also means recognising that this great leap forward in connecting people can cause harm, to iniduals and society at large. The argument that the web should be beyond careful regulation is long past its sell by date. Social media giants have come of age and are making vast profits. Now they must take on the big responsibilities we expect of all big companies.To lead the world, therefore, Britain must set a new standard for these firms: to enhance their reputation and sustain their business models for the long term, by protecting their users.The time to act is now. A growing body of research has linked social media use to a range of mental health problems, from depression and anxiety to eating disorders and sleep problems. As the generation that use social media the most, it is those aged 16 to 24 that are being hardest hit.Duty of care puffA report by the Royal Society for Public Health suggested that social media can be more addictive than alcohol or cigarettes. Cyber‑bullying and grooming are rife on some platforms. The tragic suicide of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who was exposed to distressing material about depression and suicide on Instagram, brings home the dark side of social media. Systems designed to bring people together are leaving many young people feeling isolated, alone and alienated.The harmful effects extend beyond this, however. From extremism and intellectual property scams to subverting our democratic processes, the power of social media can all too easily be perverted.So we need a new approach that all social media sites will adopt – we need something that will go viral, so to speak. As the use of social media is increasingly universal, any solutions have to be systemic – and taken seriously by all the players in the industry. This is why I am backing the Daily ’s duty of care campaign.Put simply, social media giants should have a statutory duty of care to their users, obliging them to take more responsibility for reasonably foreseeable damage caused to iniduals and the public through use of their platforms. The idea of a duty of care set out in statute is not new. For decades, companies have had a duty of care to their employees as well as employers. As Professor Lorna Woods and William Perrin point out, there is no reason why a similar system cannot be evolved for the tech industry.Real and fast progress is vital. But this will only be achieved if the tech giants take the lead in working with a willing government to design this new statutory regime. The attention paid to this issue by this newspaper and the dignified campaign of Molly Russell’s parents have forced Instagram to welcome the idea of a duty of care. That is a good start, but it will take more than words to mitigate the harmful effects of social media.Duty of Care campaign | Read moreEffective leadership involves tech giants rethinking the design of their services in a safety-conscious way. Just as passenger, public and environmental safety is critical to the car manufacturing industry, social media platforms need to see prevention of harm as core to their business. We, rightly, expect more from business, with the demands on them to operate responsibly – wherever they are – increasingly daily.Tech giants spend serious money understanding their users. Investing in tools to limit the anxiety, insecurity and depression their services can foster (for example) should be part of their license to operate.If social media companies want to be a force for good, they must share the responsibility and lead the way in dealing with the bad. This should be their covenant with their customers.Duty of Care CampaignComment: We can no longer turn our backs on the invisible war waged on the world\u0026#39s childrenThe world\u0026#39s children are being \u0026#39failed\u0026#39 as report reveals one in five live in a conflict zone Cannabis-based treatment will be offered to dementia patients Entrance to hell discovered... in Nottinghamshire as witch marks reveal what 15th century Britons thought was doorway to underworld Hi-tech scanners to detect drug smuggling in 10 of the worst jails delayed on slow boat from ChinaDonald Trump will \u0026#39declare national emergency\u0026#39 to build Mexico border wallShort bursts of intensive exercise better than lengthy gym sessions for shedding the pounds GCHQ brainteaser: Can you crack a code devised by masters of British intelligence?Lord Nazir Ahmed accused of exploiting position to pursue sex with vulnerable seeking helpEdinburgh University principal admits lowering entry grades for poor could mean others miss outBiggest head teachers\u0026#39 union backs duty of care laws on social media firmsComment: Lowering university entry grades for disadvantaged students will unlock their potential, not hit standardsSir Philip Green\u0026#39s knighthood should be reviewed says former head of Honours\u0026#39 forfeiture committeeNHS targets \u0026#39have had their day\u0026#39 says health service chief as he claims they encourage \u0026#39gaming\u0026#39 US plans to jail British jihadis in Guantanamo after getting fed-up with UK\u0026#39s soft approach to terroristsComment: John Henry Newman should be an inspiration to Christians – the only group it\u0026#39s still OK to hate How Prince Philip reacted to crash -

which involves alternating high and low-intensity effort - sheds more pounds than a workout that is of the same moderate intensity throughout, experts found.The study, published by the British Journal of Sports Medicine, looked at 36 studies involving more than 1,000 people.It found that those using high-intensity interval training (HIIT) lost substantially more weight than those sticking with traditional gym routines.The best results of all were achieved by those adopting short but extreme bursts of exercise - known as sprint training.The method, used in running and cycling, typically means going “all out” for 30 seconds before a four minute recovery period of slower exercise.Participants in such regimes lost 6 per cent of body fat, compared with loss of 3.4 per cent among those doing a standard gym session of 41 minutes.The midlife HIIT rules: how to use high intensity workouts without harming your bodyOverall, those taking part in all types of HIIT training lost 29 per cent more weight than those taking part in conventional workouts, losing an average of 3.5 pounds, compared with 2.5 pounds among other gym-goers.People wanting to lose weight are often advised to spend an hour or more exercising each day.But the researchers said few people find the time, while shorter workouts could be easier to achieve.The results showed that both interval training and a continuous workout reduced overall weight and percentage body fat.While both approaches helped reduce percentage body fat to the same extent, interval training was better for shedding pounds.The experts, from universities in Brazil and the School of Sport, Health and Social Sciences in Hampshire, said: Interval training is an attractive alternative to address overweight and obesity given its potential to offer benefits similar to moderate-intensity continuous training while requiring less time.But they said people should take care as interval training might increase the risk of injury and impose higher cardiovascular stress.Steven Ward, chief executive of fitness body Ukactive said: “These figures clearly show the positive health impacts of HIIT on reducing weight, and with Britain battling a grave obesity crisis, this research should be welcomed.”But he said the most important aspect of exercise was finding something that was enjoyable enough to stick with.“For some that may mean squeezing in a high-intensity spin class, for others it might mean a lunchtime jog in the park or a walk with the family on the weekend,” he said.Comment: We can no longer turn our backs on the invisible war waged on the world\u0026#39s childrenThe world\u0026#39s children are being \u0026#39failed\u0026#39 as report reveals one in five live in a conflict zone Cannabis-based treatment will be offered to dementia patients Entrance to hell discovered... in Nottinghamshire as witch marks reveal what 15th century Britons thought was doorway to underworld Hi-tech scanners to detect drug smuggling in 10 of the worst jails delayed on slow boat from ChinaDonald Trump will \u0026#39declare national emergency\u0026#39 to build Mexico border wallGCHQ brainteaser: Can you crack a code devised by masters of British intelligence?Lord Nazir Ahmed accused of exploiting position to pursue sex with vulnerable seeking helpEdinburgh University principal admits lowering entry grades for poor could mean others miss outBiggest head teachers\u0026#39 union backs duty of care laws on social media firmsComment: Lowering university entry grades for disadvantaged students will unlock their potential, not hit standardsSir Philip Green\u0026#39s knighthood should be reviewed says former head of Honours\u0026#39 forfeiture committeeNHS targets \u0026#39have had their day\u0026#39 says health service chief as he claims they encourage \u0026#39gaming\u0026#39 US plans to jail British jihadis in Guantanamo after getting fed-up with UK\u0026#39s soft approach to terroristsComment: John Henry Newman should be an inspiration to Christians – the only group it\u0026#39s still OK to hate How Prince Philip reacted to crash -

And they could be as big a change as when the wires dropped out of Apple\u0027s existing headphones and they were first born.Introduced in 2016, the two truly wireless earphones haven\u0027t been updated since. They came with a wide range of futuristic features – but a range of rumours have swirled around them about new updates, that would bring new and even more futuristic features.The AirPods are actually two (or three) different things: the case that protects them and the earphones that sit inside. Until recently, they\u0027d be considered one and the same – but recent leaks have suggested that Apple might update the two separately, with different release dates.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAccording to recent rumours, the new case is likely to arrive earlier, and maybe soon. It could even be a part of Apple\u0027s March event. The actual release date is probably dependent on when Apple releases the AirPower mat that it\u0027s charging could rely on.The earphones themselves are likely to undergo a more dramatic reinvention. But that could also take longer to arrive. Those could not be updated for some months, according to recent rumours – and perhaps won\u0027t even arrive until September, when the new phones are introduced.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

And most of the rumours focus around how exactly it would do that.New AirPods charging case could come before updated earphonesMost likely, the biggest change in any new case would be the addition of wireless charging. That would allow them to charge up just like a phone, being able to be plonked down a wireless charging puck and then transfer that into its battery as well as the AirPods themselves.Apple has actually teased a new case before, when it announced the AirPower wireless charging mat. It said that a new case would be needed to allow the AirPods to be charged through that new product – but then the new product never actually arrived.The company did say then that the case would be updated but that the existing AirPods would be compatible with the new one. And people would be able to pay a reduced price just to buy the case and update, it made clear – an offer that will presumably stay around with the new earphones.Another rumoured change includes the addition of a new and grippier kind of plastic, which should make the box easier to hold. And if as suggested Apple does introduce new colours of AirPods, such as black, presumably the case will also change colour too.But it\u0027s the earphones that have most of the technology. Rumours have suggested that a whole host of new (and sometimes strange)\u0026nbspfeatures could be coming to the new earbuds.The most likely feature – in part because it\u0027s been apparently revealed by Apple\u0027s own software – is always-on Hey Siri. That will mean that people don\u0027t have to do the uncomfortable move of tapping their own ears to wake the earphones up, and instead just say Hey Siri any time they\u0027re wearing their AirPods to speak with the voice assistant.Other rumoured updates including new health tracking tools. Apple has been keen to get into those features with technology like the Apple Watch, and the inside of people\u0027s ears is a great place to take readings for things like heartbeat and temperature, which could happen with future AirPods.Apple is also likely to improve the performance in less obvious ways. The new buds will probably feature better wireless connectivity, and improved waterproofing.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The argument revolves around a feature called envelope tracking, which allows the phones to improve their battery life while they send and receive wireless signals.Qualcomm claimed that some of the non-Qualcomm\u0026nbspchips Apple was using infinged those patents, and should be removed from sale.German courts agreed with Qualcomm, and banned sale of the iPhones that used those chips. That led Apple to completely remove those phones from sale in both its retail and online stores, while an appeal continues.Now Apple said it will put those phones back on sale, but will only use the versions that feature the Qualcomm chips and so will be in line with the court\u0027s decision.The dispute between Apple and Qualcomm has been felt across the world. In December, Apple was also ordered to stop selling some iPhones in China because of a similar argument.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that.

Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you\u0027re hooked, you\u0027ll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into – which is enough that by the time you\u0027re done, you\u0027ll be ready to start again.She dresses like a primary school teacher, smiles like the Cheshire cat, and sees the best in absolutely everybody: Kimmy Schmidt is an unusual heroine today. There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life.

Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Phantom Thread has all the trappings of a conventional period romance. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier. James Mason plays the alcoholic actor whose career is on the wane, while Judy Garland is the supremely talented up-and-coming singer he meets in a nightclub. Although there were two other major screen versions of the story – one in 1937, the other in 1976 starring Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson – Garland boasts the strongest singing voice of any, and her chemistry with Mason is superb.In this futuristic romance, Joaquin Phoenix plays a man who falls in love with an artificially intelligent computer system, voiced by Scarlett Johannsson. Her – written and directed by Spike Jonze – treats Phoenix\u0027s courtship with all the sensitivity of a flesh-and-blood romance, and what could be a cringe-worthy or facetious premise instead blossoms into a touchingly sincere examination of love in the age of technology.This romcom from 1999 brings Hugh Grant’s down-to-earth bookshop owner into the orbit of an A-list actress played by Julia Roberts, and the unlikeliest of British love affairs ensues. Scripted by Richard Curtis, who had already proved himself a dab hand in the genre with Four Weddings and a Funeral, the film manages to stay charming and keep its tone light, even as its romantic plotline descends into schmaltz.True Romance has an all-star cast that includes Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini, but eyes are mostly kept on the whirlwind romance struck up between Clarence and Alabama (played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette), who go on the run with a suitcase full of cocaine belonging to a notorious gangster. Quentin Tarantino’s script wades through some heavy subject matter, and includes plenty of his characteristic violence, underscored by an effective score from Hans Zimmer.620 Harold and Maude (1971)Age-gap relationships are common in cinema, but seldom like in Harold and Maude. Harold (Bud Cort) is an 18-year-old with an overbearing mother who spends his free time staging elaborate fake suicides. After meeting Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman trying to grab life by the horns, he falls in love. Hal Ashby’s off-beat cult classic doesn’t shy away from the social taboos of their relationship, but make no mistake, Harold and Maude is an earnest and deeply moving romance at its core.720 Beauty and the Beast (1991)The classic French fairy-tale – about the love between a beautiful woman and a prince cursed to live as a beast – has been adapted countless times, most recently into a live-action blockbuster starring Emma Watson. Disney’s 1991 animated musical, however, is the superior on-screen rendering of the romance. Although elements of the story now seem problematic – most glaringly the idea of the Beast imprisoning Belle, and she loving him despite this – there\u0027s still a lot of appeal in the songs, and the hand-drawn animation is fluid and endearing.Positioning three of Old Hollywood’s most beloved stars at the corners of a love triangle, The Philadelphia Story is one of the most enduring romcoms of all time. Navigating its way around the strict Production Code rules regarding extra-marital affairs, George Cukor’s film tells the story of a orced couple (Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant) who are drawn back together despite the allure of a third party (Jimmy Stewart). All three actors play to their strengths: Grant is suave and sardonic, Stewart wide-eyed and self-effacing, while Hepburn is given a strong role in the woman who must choose between her capable suitors.In Carol, Cate Blanchett plays Carol Aird, a woman in the midst of a difficult orce who falls in love with a young photographer, Therese, played by Rooney Mara. The film – a sexy and stylish period piece directed by Todd Haynes – won a host of Oscar nominations, and stands as one of the most specific and deftly crafted representations of female desire in mainstream cinema, earning a particularly devoted fanbase in the LGBTQ community.The highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the US, Amélie is a modern-day fairy-tale about a socially maladjusted young woman who decides to dedicate her life to impishly and secretly helping others. The film leans into the tweeness of its premise, as well as the romance of its Parisian setting, to build a gradual love story that’s straight from the heart. It’s not all sweetness, however, and some of the more world-weary touches – such as Amélie’s lover working in a sex shop – help give the film some sharp edges, and a comic bite.Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger as two sheep herders who go through a turbulent but passionate romance. The film’s open and unapologetic depiction of sex and queer relationships made it a landmark release for LGBT representation in mainstream cinema.Directed by Frank Capra, master of the feel-good film, It Happened One Night mixes screwball comedy with heartfelt romance. Claudette Colbert plays a wealthy socialite who decides to slum it with an abrasive but charismatic news reporter, played by Clark Gable. One of only three films to ever win all five major Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), It Happened One Night endures as the gold standard for a classical Hollywood romcom.1320 Call Me by Your Name (2017)Set in an Edenic villa “somewhere in Northern Italy”, Call Me by Your Name tells the story of Elio (Timothée Chalamet), a smart but directionless 17-year-old who falls in love with his father’s research assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer). Luca Guadagnino’s languid romance is well on its way to being considered a modern queer classic and it made an instant star out of Chalamet when it hit cinemas in 2017.Richard Linklater’s minimalist romance pairs Ethan Hawke with Julie Delpy as two love-struck strangers who meet on a train and spend the evening together wandering around Vienna. The naturally romantic city is the perfect background for a soft and thoughtful meditation on love, fate and missed opportunities. Hawke and Delpy reportedly crafted much of the naturalistic dialogue through improvisation sessions, for which they were uncredited. They would, however, be credited in the film’s two sequels – Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013).2016 Best Picture winner Moonlight is a radical film: a queer romance with an all-black cast that captures a boy’s coming-of-age with heart-wrenching specificity. Chiron, the protagonist, is played by three actors across three chapters of his life – and the third act, in which an adult Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) reconnects with an old flame, is one of the most heart-rending in modern cinema. Writer-director Barry Jenkins showed himself to have a poet’s ear for dialogue and James Laxton’s camerawork perfectly captures the vibrancy and the physicality of romantic attraction.1620 In the Mood for Love (2000)One of the most acclaimed pieces of Asian cinema of all time, In the Mood for Love is a masterful study in love behind closed doors, tracking the emotional affair between two people who realise their spouses are having an affair together. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are exceptional in the lead roles as two soulmates struggling to contain their desire. In 2016, the film was voted the second-best film of the 21st century in a BBC critics poll.David Lean’s tender depiction of an unconsummated extra-marital affair remains one of the finest love stories ever told, and frequently ranks among the best British films ever made. Adapted from Noel Coward’s one-act play Still Life, Brief Encounter focuses on the relationship between Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) and Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard). Their courtship is bookended by two fateful scenes at a train station – once meeting, once parting. It’s hard to estimate how many hundreds of on-screen romances have ended with a teary-eyed lover being carried away on a train, but none have done so as memorably as Brief Encounter.When Harry Met Sally took Annie Hall’s subversion of the romcom genre and removed the neuroses and pseudo-intellectualism. The result was a breezy, observational romantic comedy starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as two unlikely lovers. Screenwriter Nora Ephron based much of the film on its eventual director, Rob Reiner. When Harry Met Sally would become a massive hit, spawning an iconic catchphrase (“I’ll have what she’s having”) and even a stage adaptation in 2004.Jack Lemmon plays bedraggled corporate yes-man CC Baxter, who falls in love with elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who is also his boss’s mistress. The 1960 masterpiece, directed by Billy Wilder, is equal parts cynical and romantic, and features one of the most compelling will-they-won\u0027t-theys in the history of cinema.The romance of Casablanca has resonated throughout the 20th century. Its dialogue is among the most-quoted in film history and its locations – the piano bar the airfield – are indelible pieces of Hollywood iconography. Humphrey Bogart is the perfect romantic lead as Rick Blaine, the bitter, lovelorn club owner in French-occupied Morocco whose ex-lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) arrives with her new flame Victor Laszlow (Paul Henreid), who is wanted by the Nazis. Casablanca has been mimicked and parodied so many times throughout the years that it’s easy to forget quite how inventive it is in its depiction of a love affair torn apart by the brutality of the outside world.Phantom Thread has all the trappings of a conventional period romance. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier.

He must carry ampoules for injection in the event of an emergency, but these have a limited shelf-life and he needs regular fresh supplies.He recently went to his usual pharmacy\u0026nbspto obtain a new batch of these life-saving drugs, but was informed by the pharmacist that she did not have them in stock. She told Woodman that “we can’t get hold of them” and explained it was because of Brexit.If Brexit is reversed ‘there will be blood on the streets’The experience of being denied the drugs that he needs to keep himself alive reinforced Woodman’s opposition to the UK leaving the EU. “I am horrified by the biggest act of national self-harm in my lifetime – I am 52 – and probably going back a lot earlier,” he says. “It’s not as bad as going to war, but it’s not far off.”The maternity services in Llandough would have collapsed if it was not for the Filipino nursesHe does not see the political and economic damage as something confined to a post-Brexit future, but as a destructive process that is underway and already inflicting losses among real people. As a regional organiser for Unison in Wales, he deals with the problems of union members such as staff at less well-known and less well-funded universities that can no longer attract foreign students. The prospective students are deterred by Brexit uncertainties over their status and qualifications but formerly paid high fees and were an essential cash-cow for the institutions.Woodman says he is particularly concerned about the University of South Wales. Brexit, he believes, “has the capacity to bankrupt the place because the supply of overseas students has dried up”. Other universities are coming under intense financial pressure, meaning “lecturers and support staff are being let go … I am trying to save my members’ jobs”. He adds that Brexit is exacerbating the crisis in the NHS in Wales because of the difficulty in recruiting foreign doctors and nurses who have hitherto kept it going.Ian Thomas, a psychiatric nurse at Llandough Hospital in the Vale of Glamorgan, agrees that the active recruitment of foreign medical workers has been essential. “The maternity services in Llandough would have collapsed if it was not for the Filipino nurses,” he says.Created with Sketch.

The surface of the body designed to sell the product has been satirised with graffiti in Arabic: “Oh, fire of my heart!” I read the message as a subversive play on heat and attraction in our society, counterposing the superficial, sexualised burning of the body’s exterior (tanning) with the purer, warmer image of the interior fire of love.The university Geography Society beats the History Society in a drinking competition. Participants turn glasses over above their heads to prove that they’re empty. Student supporters cheer from the balconies in drunken delirium.A distinctly twenty-first-century British hieroglyphic. A symbol conveying an obsession with virility, with its tendency to tarnish and spoil, to reduce everything it touches to an insignificant canvas for its power. I would say it has something to do with Port Talbot’s phallic steelworks and their daily emission, if I hadn’t seen it so much elsewhere in Britain.Children imagine the future of the town, and in so doing transform the present, from something static and fixed to a place of becoming, where “now” is simply a transitional phase, pregnant with the utopian possibilities of “Las Tydfil”, a place combining two of Britain’s strongest currents: environmentalism and gambling. The Welsh Dragon is printed on plastic bags probably because the company thinks it can sell more products by tapping into the country’s niche patriotism. Yet, it also means that the Welsh Dragon is being treated as rubbish, thrown to the gutter, trashed in landfill, left as litter in a mess of detritus. Black Friday on Queen Street. The street is lined with commercial exclamations - of sales and deals and time running out - that sometimes appear better as ironic parodies of the fate of the capital’s rough sleepers than notices of the products and bargains they promote.An anarchist imperative opposite the prison wall, suggesting to the residential area that fundamental, wholesale social change cannot come about through participating in the democratic political process, but only by rejecting it, confronting it, and rising against it.

The surface of the body designed to sell the product has been satirised with graffiti in Arabic: “Oh, fire of my heart!” I read the message as a subversive play on heat and attraction in our society, counterposing the superficial, sexualised burning of the body’s exterior (tanning) with the purer, warmer image of the interior fire of love.The university Geography Society beats the History Society in a drinking competition. Participants turn glasses over above their heads to prove that they’re empty. Student supporters cheer from the balconies in drunken delirium.A distinctly twenty-first-century British hieroglyphic. A symbol conveying an obsession with virility, with its tendency to tarnish and spoil, to reduce everything it touches to an insignificant canvas for its power. I would say it has something to do with Port Talbot’s phallic steelworks and their daily emission, if I hadn’t seen it so much elsewhere in Britain.Children imagine the future of the town, and in so doing transform the present, from something static and fixed to a place of becoming, where “now” is simply a transitional phase, pregnant with the utopian possibilities of “Las Tydfil”, a place combining two of Britain’s strongest currents: environmentalism and gambling. The Welsh Dragon is printed on plastic bags probably because the company thinks it can sell more products by tapping into the country’s niche patriotism. Yet, it also means that the Welsh Dragon is being treated as rubbish, thrown to the gutter, trashed in landfill, left as litter in a mess of detritus. Black Friday on Queen Street. The street is lined with commercial exclamations - of sales and deals and time running out - that sometimes appear better as ironic parodies of the fate of the capital’s rough sleepers than notices of the products and bargains they promote.An anarchist imperative opposite the prison wall, suggesting to the residential area that fundamental, wholesale social change cannot come about through participating in the democratic political process, but only by rejecting it, confronting it, and rising against it. Investment cut in half. The promise of a sale broken. Once an announcement, now discarded to the street, visible only to those looking down, more meaningful now than ever before, in the company of rotting autumn.The town has a similar accent to the Liverpudlian one. There are hints that it shares an undercurrent of resentment towards The Sun newspaper too.Debate in Britain over the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the EU have focused largely on the economic consequences of the move. The first concrete signs of this are in higher education and health as well as in international companies such as Airbus and Nissan. But it is the political changes in Britain produced by the 2016 referendum which are more advanced and more visible than the economic ones – and which have the potential to be much more serious.Two very different political trends have gathered pace since the vote to leave the EU and are becoming irreversible: Britain is a far more ided society, perhaps more so than at any time since the Home Rule crises in the 19th and early 20th century and possibly since the turmoil of the 17th century. “People who lived happily next door to each other are now at daggers drawn,” says Woodman. Grievances that have little or nothing to do with the EU\u0026nbsphave been energised and envenomed by the anti-EU vote.Outside Westminster, people are becoming numb to the Brexit crisisCardiff and south Wales are a useful guide to the politics of Brexit in Britain because the outcome of the referendum here helps demolish conventional wisdom about why a majority of those who went to the polls in the rest of Britain wanted to exit the EU.\u0026nbspWales voted Leave\u0026nbspby 52.5 per cent to 47.5 per cent, which surprised some because it receives substantial EU subsidies, amounting to £680m a year, according to the Welsh government. What’s more, Remain\u0026nbspwas backed by the Labour Party, which has dominated Welsh politics for the past 97 years. Yet only five out of 22 local authorities voted to remain, very much mirroring the split in England between poor and better off, less educated and well-educated, old and young.Cardiff, a prosperous-looking city of 350,000 – one of five UK cities most dependent on EU markets – voted 60 per cent to stay in the EU. But the valleys just to the north of Cardiff, a de-industrialised region once filled with coal mines and steel plants, opted strongly for Leave. The pattern of voting was much the same as in England, though the valleys are famous for their strongly-held Welsh identity and loyalty to the Labour Party, something which they were to confirm in the 2017\u0026nbspgeneral election.In the 1980s we used to regularly have dog shit in Tesco bags pushed through our letter box and ‘Pakis Out’ in big letters written on the side wall of our houseThe outcome of the referendum in Wales puts in doubt the widely credited belief that Brexit was significantly fuelled by resurgent English nationalism and nostalgia for a lost imperial past. This thesis looks less convincing if Welsh socialists, who do not feel the same about the British empire and are still bitter about the crushing of the miners’ strike in 1984-85, voted the same way as English Leavers.Care also needs to be taken when arguing about the degree to which the Brexit vote was propelled by opposition to immigration and Islamophobia, because, while there are many immigrant communities in Cardiff, there are very few in the valleys,\u0026nbspwhere there is not a single mosque according to residents.Of course, the absence of immigrants on the street does not necessarily mean that there is no hostility towards their presence\u0026nbspnationally. Local opinion is split on this, but Graham Simmonds, an independent member of Caerphilly Council who is a Leave supporter, says that emphasis on anti-immigration as an issue in the valleys “is just a stick that the media uses to beat us”. He adds: “I have never encountered it.”Whatever the role of the anti-immigrant vote, there is a simple reason why Cardiff, a government centre with much employment in health and education (it has three universities), should vote differently from the families of former miners and steel workers in the valleys.West Wales and the valleys, once a hub\u0026nbspof the industrial revolution in Britain, today top the list of the five poorest areas in northern Europe, according to 2016 figures. Interestingly, the next four on the list are all in England: Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, Lincolnshire, South Yorkshire, and the Tees Valley and Durham. As in Wales, these deprived regions voted strongly for Brexit, with Lincolnshire having the highest proportion of Leave voters in the UK. Poverty, not national identity, appears to be the dominant factor.UK manufacturers stockpile at record pace in January ahead of BrexitImmigration is an easy explanation for people in deprived areas who want to know why they are jobless or have ill-paid, insecure employment. Pro-Brexit tabloids have for decades drip-fed readers with stories portraying immigrants as parasites on the NHS and the undeserved recipients of largesse through exploiting state benefits.Even so, it is difficult to judge the extent of anti-immigrant feeling, because people are embarrassed to express it and, even when they did in interviews with The Independent, some later asked for their comments to be removed. Police figures for hate crimes or abuse are not very accurate because officers often do not have the resources, the numbers or the inclination to follow such incidents up, according to Cardiff residents.Those from ethnic minorities in the city are better judges of the extent to which the referendum and its aftermath turbo-charged racism in Britain and raised it to a new and more toxic level. Trade union leaders from minority communities (Pakistani, Sikh, Caribbean, Portuguese) spoke to The Independent about their personal experience of racism and about their members who had filed or been the targets of complaints about alleged abuse. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShavanah Taj is a national officer for the Public and Commercial Services Union, whose father came from Pakistan to work in a steel plant in south Wales in 1958-59. She is married to a Nigerian and has two children aged five and seven. She says that racist abuse has markedly increased in the last three or four years, though she stresses that it was also bad in the past.\u0026nbsp“In the 1980s we used to regularly have dog shit in Tesco bags pushed through our letter box and ‘Pakis Out’ in big letters written on the side wall of our house.” She says this of kind of abuse ebbed in the following years, but has now returned – and strengthened. \u0026nbspAs an Asian woman with two small children, she says she has been harassed by white men who block her way in the street. Invariably, when she walks into a shop “the security guard will follow me around”.For the first time she and her husband are asking themselves if they\u0026nbspwill get to the point when they\u0026nbspno longer think of the areas as\u0026nbsphome.\u0026nbspPreviously, she and her family had never felt it necessary to have a Plan B about where they should live.\u0026nbspNow they wonder if they ought to.Created with Sketch.10 novels to help you beat the Brexit blues Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendLucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendAmarjite Singh, a Sikh who works for the Royal Mail, is branch secretary of the Communications Workers Union and wears a distinctive red turban. He agrees with Taj that open racism receded from the end of the 1980s up to 2016. Other are less sanguine and say there has been mounting Islamophobia propelled by 911, 77 and the rise of Isis after 2014.Singh says\u0026nbspthe most significant change is the degree to which the extreme right is today able to mobilise\u0026nbsppeople. “I haven’t seen so many far-right demonstrations up and down the country ever before with rallies on the same weekend in Birmingham, Leeds and Newcastle,” he says.I know a plasterer who told me that he is now reading a book by Tommy Robinson called ‘Enemy of the State’, which he says is the first book that he has ever readBrexit may originally have been about leaving the EU and about anxiety over immigration from Eastern Europe – indeed, says Singh, many Sikhs voted Leave because they thought foreigners were coming to take their jobs. But then they found that immigrants from the subcontinent and beyond were also targeted.Singh recalls:\u0026nbsp“Two weeks ago I was on a bus and there was a Somali woman with a baby in a pram who could not put it in the space allotted for it because a young man was blocking it. When the bus driver told him to let her park the pram there, the young man replied: ‘Who does she think she is?\u0026nbspShe’s only a foreigner’.”Woodman, whose mother immigrated to the UK from Portugal in 1952 and whose father came from Guyana, agrees that the Brexit vote has exacerbated racism, saying: “It emboldens people, as it does in Trump’s America, to say in public what they used to say in private. I have been called the n-word and that rarely happened in recent years.” He adds that it is wrong to blame everything on Brexit, but he finds it difficult to think of any other explanation for the racist surge.It’s time to call out broken Brexit promises on tradeWhite indigenous residents in south Wales confirm that the extreme right is becoming legitimised in a way that it was not in the past. Ian Thomas, who has long campaigned against racism, says\u0026nbsphe is more worried now than he has ever been before, because he believes that racial hatred, that was always there, but hidden, is coming increasingly to the surface.The rise of the extreme right and open displays of racism have occurred in the past (Oswald Mosley in the 1930s, the Notting Hill riots in the 1950s, Enoch Powell’s “Rivers of Blood”\u0026nbspspeech in 1968, the National Front in the 1970s) but they have peaked and then evaporated or returned to obscurity. Often, they took advantage of periods of acute economic and political instability which came to an end.What is so different about the current crisis over Brexit is that there is no reason why the crisis should come to an end any time soon, and every reason why it should get worse, providing the far-right with fertile ground to expound their racist creed.Not all the arrows point in the same direction and some polls show that hostility to immigrants has receded somewhat since 2016, when Syrian refugees were flooding into Europe and Isis was carrying out highly publicised atrocities in the centre of European capitals.But in the eyes of many people, immigrants remain a threat and the evidence is that this perception has not changed very much. As Woodman says, all that you need to do to generate racial hatred “is to persuade people that those who are different from themselves are the reason they are poor”.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

That light is invisible to the human eye but is a useful tool for exploring the universe: it will give astronomers a look at more than 300 million galaxies, as well as 100 million stars in our Milky Way.This amazing mission will be a treasure trove of unique data for astronomers,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, in a statement. “It will deliver an unprecedented galactic map containing ‘fingerprints’ from the first moments in the universe’s history. And we’ll have new clues to one of the greatest mysteries in science: What made the universe expand so quickly less than a nanosecond after the big bang?”To answer those questions, SPHEREx will look out at all those galaxies, some of which are so far away that the light reaching us has taken 10 billion years to travel through the universe. It will hunt out water and organic molecules in the hope that we can understand where – and how often – those ingredients for life occur throughout the cosmos.It will also look out\u0026nbspto create\u0026nbspmap of the entire sky, in 96 different colour bands.

This all seems very much at\u0026nbspodds with earlier comments from Carney that Brexit could wipe 8 per cent off GDP and that house prices could crash by as much as 35 per cent.On the face of it, this is a conversion to rival Paul’s as he approached Damascus in AD5.

He talked about, among other things, the effects of a slowdown in China. Then he placed Brexit in the context of broader upheavals stemming from globalisation. The crisis in policing shows the danger of a single-issue government“Trade tensions abroad and Brexit debates at home are manifestations of fundamental pressures to reorder globalisation,” Carney said.“It is possible that new rules of the road will be developed for a more inclusive and resilient global economy.”But crucially he then laid out a second point that has conveniently been left out of a number of accounts: “At the same time, there is a risk that countries turn inwards, undercutting growth and prosperity for all.”Carney’s approach here should not surprise anyone. He is an economist and a central banker, not a political pundit. In that role he doesn’t back one side of a debate or another he puts forward a range of possible outcomes, based on analysis.He is used to traders and market commentators poring over and dissecting his every word for a sign of where interest rates are heading, and so he deliberately gives little away.But what about that project fear doom-mongering in months gone by?As it happens, Carney\u0026nbspdidn’t say house prices would crash by 35 per cent or that GDP would drop 8 per cent in a year. In both cases he laid out a number of best, worst and middling scenarios.The middle scenario rarely makes for the best headline.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

It is too small to appear on the world stage on its own.”He also warned that hundreds of companies had plans to relocate across the North Sea from Britain.Government must ‘get its act together’ to prevent Brexit panic-buying “We can’t stop them from coming here,” he said of the news that around 250 UK-based firms had been in talks to relocate to Britain’s closest ally in the EU, to retain access to the single market.“Every businessman I speak to from the UK is saying they will cut investments, cut their business in the UK. It will have an insurmountable impact on the UK,” he told the Financial Times, adding that Britain was a “more diminished country compared to what it was two or three years ago”.Sony and Panasonic are among high-profile names to have cited Brexit in their relocation, but the trade and investment arm of the Dutch government, the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency, has been actively soliciting more firms and says hundreds more are on the verge of moving.Mr Rutte also said Britain’s allies on the continent were aghast at the fact the UK was doing little to stop a no-deal Brexit.“At the moment, the ball is rolling towards the Dover cliff and we are shouting ‘Stop the ball from rolling any further’ but nobody is doing anything at the moment, at least not on the UK side,” he said.Responding to Mr\u0026nbspRutte’s comments, the PM’s spokesman said: “I disagree entirely. Employment is at a record high, exports are at a record high, companies are continuing to invest in the UK.“Deloitte named the UK as Europe’s leading destination for foreign direct investment and London as the world’s top city for investment just last month.”Reports out of Westminster and accidental leaks from UK Brexit negotiators suggest Theresa May wants to wait until the very last moment to force her MPs to vote through her Brexit deal.But the brinkmanship raises the prospect of a possible no-deal, as sought by some hardline Conservative MPs.Mr Rutte said that as a result of the exodus, the Netherlands had only seen benefits from Brexit so far – though his country could face serious disruption at its ports and airports in the event of a no-deal.Created with Sketch.Politicians\u0027 Brexit tweets don\u0027t hold up well to time or fact Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.These billboards were plastered by campaign group Led By DonkeysThese billboards were plastered by campaign group Led By DonkeysThe Dutch government has sometimes appeared better prepared for Brexit than the UK, with advanced plans to recruit as many as 1,000 extra border officials to deal with potential disruption and extra bureaucracy caused by the UK’s exit.In addition to private businesses, the UK has also lost a key EU agency to Amsterdam: the European Medicines Agency, which employs around 900 highly skilled workers.We’ll tell you what’s true.

We should not be helping to deliver Brexit.”Mr Lewis – who resigned to oppose the triggering of Article 50 exit notice in 2017 – again called for an in-or-out Final Say referendum on the prime minister’s deal.He also warned of a future European war, as Brexit propelled the rise of the far right, saying: “If we walk away from Europe now, my children, your children, or possibly our grandchildren, will be back in Europe in a few years’ time – but in uniform.”Brexit ‘uncertainty’ blamed as airline cancels UK flightsBrexit already costing UK £800m per week, Bank of England expert saysUK a ‘diminished country on the wane’ after Brexit vote, says Dutch PMDefeating May in Commons would ‘hit PM’s chance to win concessions’“We cannot forget what Europe has done to keep the peace in Europe.”Two other frontbenchers – rail spokeswoman Rachael Maskell\u0026nbspand Paul Sweeney, the shadow Scotland minister– also called for a referendum on the Brexit outcome.Labour’s official position is still to press for a general election, if its softer Brexit plan is rejected in the Commons, with a fresh public vote only “an option”.The criticism came as a Labour MP on the opposite wing of the party – Corbyn critic Chris Leslie – warned Final Say supporters were being “played for fools” by their\u0026nbspleader.The Nottingham East MP urged government ministers opposing Brexit to “do the brave thing and resign” to make up for the failure to deliver “what should be a solid Labour move against this outrageous situation”.Criticising\u0026nbsphis party’s amendment, Mr Leslie said he no longer sees the “option of a public vote\u0026nbspwhich was there when we had the amendment on 29\u0026nbspJanuary”.\u0026nbspHe added:\u0026nbsp“Why are we regressing in our party’s policy passed at the September conference?”And he added: “I certainly feel that we are being played for fools by the leadership of the Labour Party on this particular issue because, by now, we should have reached the stage of a public vote when it comes to the option of remaining in the EU.”Frontbench supporters of a referendum are becoming increasingly frustrated by Mr Corbyn’s failure to switch to outright support – even after the prime minster rejected Labour’s proposals, which include staying in a customs union.Resignations are possible if the Labour leader continues to sit on the fence when the next round of Brexit votes take place on 27 February.However, shadow ministers are keen for a concerted move, which would need to be led by the shadow cabinet, where Keir Starmer, the Brexit spokesman, is pushing for a referendum.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.One leading Tory described the night as a “fiasco”, Jeremy Corbyn said the country was heading for a “catastrophe”, and a senior source in Brussels said: “There goes the strong mandate.”The Brexit fault line also cut through Mr Corbyn’s party on Thursday, with a significant number of Labour MPs apparently defying their leader’s will in a separate vote\u0026nbspamid suspicions that some are close to breaking away.Corbyn suffers revolt as 41 Labour MPs back ‘immediate’ Brexit delayBut the spotlight was firmly on the prime minister’s ailing administration as it contorted in an attempt to avoid defeat on what did not have to be a difficult night for Ms May.The wording of Thursday’s motion called on MPs to reiterate their support for the approach set out in an earlier set of votes on 29 January, when the Commons backed a plan to reopen negotiations with Brussels on the withdrawal agreement –\u0026nbspbut also voted for a non-binding amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit.After the government apparently combined\u0026nbspsupport for both issues in Thursday’s motion, rather than just focussing on renegotiating with the EU, Tory Euroceptics who want to keep no deal on the table found themselves unable to back Ms May’s position.It’s an unfortunate fiasco that the government’s clumsiness createdGovernment whips tried and failed in the hours running up to the vote\u0026nbspto convince Brexiteers that backing the government on Thursday would not take no deal off the table.After the defeat, prominent Eurosceptic Bernard Jenkin MP said: “It’s an unfortunate fiasco that the government’s clumsiness created.“I don’t know why the government doesn’t consult a bit more widely before they table these motions. There are 110 Eurosceptic Tory MPs who helped defeat the withdrawal agreement – not one of us was consulted.”The ision list showed the government’s Brexit motion was supported by 243 of Ms\u0026nbspMay’s MPs.\u0026nbspWhile just five of them voted against it, many Tories in the\u0026nbspBrexit-backing\u0026nbspEuropean Research Group (ERG) abstained, robbing Ms May of her majority.Steve Baker, vice-chair of the ERG, said its members were not prepared to be “coopted into taking no deal off the table”, but he insisted that Ms May retains “a clear mandate” from last month’s vote to negotiate a better deal with Brussels.He said: “It’s time for some people to grow up and think about what is in the national interest.\u0026nbspThat is standing firm that we are leaving and then negotiating with the EU to get an acceptable deal.”Mr Corbyn demanded the prime minister come back to the chamber with a “coherent plan” following the defeat, claiming the vote showed there is no majority for her course of action.He went on: “The government cannot keep on ignoring parliament or ploughing on towards 29\u0026nbspMarch without a coherent plan.“She can’t keep on just running down the clock and hoping that something will turn up that will save her day and save her face.”A Downing Street spokesman accused Mr Corbyn of putting “partisan considerations” ahead of the national interest and voting in a way to make a no-deal scenario more likely.He added: “While we didn’t secure the support of the Commons this evening, the prime minister continues to believe, and the debate itself indicated, that far from objecting to securing changes to the backstop that will allow us to leave with a deal, there was a concern from some Conservative colleagues about taking no deal off the table at this stage.The spokesman said the government will now continue to seek legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement in order to secure Britain’s departure from the EU on 29 March.But the defeat does not bode well for a more significant set of votes coming on 27 February, when parliament could well use Commons amendments to take control of the process away from Ms May and delay\u0026nbspBrexit.Pro-Europe Tory\u0026nbspAnna Soubry\u0026nbspsaid: “This is a serious blow to the credibility of the prime minister. We are in such a mess, I’m afraid, that parliament is going to have to take back control of this.“It is a symbol of the profound lack of leadership in both political parties.”Mr Corbyn also suffered a major revolt when dozens of his own MPs backed an\u0026nbspSNP\u0026nbspcall for an “immediate” move to delay Brexit by extending\u0026nbspArticle 50.The Labour leader had ordered his MPs to abstain – but he was defied by 41 who voted with the Scottish Nationalists for a suspension of “no fewer than three months”, past 29 March.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But it strikes a powerful chord with real people, particularly voters in the North.They resent claims they are racist thickos and believe all parties lied to them in  when they promised to deliver on the referendum, whatever the outcome.Like the BBC — and, indeed, the EU itself — Remainers are slow to realise time is running out. Brexit is to the EU what Netflix is to the BBC. The £billion licence fee — like the European “Grand Project” — is on its way out.Whatever last-minute deal Theresa May brings home, the scepticism which brought Brexit to le cannot simply be turned off.It is a disruptive force and is already beginning to sweep away the EU as we know it.Economist Bernard Connolly famously identied this as the logical consequence of EU skulduggery in his book The Rotten Heart Of Europe: The Dirty War For Europe’s Money.Connolly was in charge of setting up the euro, the slow-burning catastrophe which has wrecked economies and young lives across the EU.He was sacked for exposing the secretive abuse of power at the very top, exposing the unscrupulous methods deployed by an unaccountable regime to bludgeon critics into submission.The same tactics are used on rebellious nations like Britain today and Greece in , triggering the explosion of anger we are seeing among protesting citizens and a rise of authoritarianism against such dissent.EU states are at each other’s throats — Italy against France, Brussels against Hungary and Poland.The rise of military-style policing — French police firing hard rubber bullets at unarmed yellow-jacket protestors, the jailing of dissident politicians in Catalonia — is alarming.Romania, a former Soviet police state, is reverting to type and spying on its own citizens.Hungary locks up opponents and silences the media.The EU does nothing, fearing for its own survival.Europe-wide polls reveal increasing antagonism to Brussels, deeper even than here in the UK.He remains a cherished champion of free speech and razor-sharp inquisitorial combat.Mean-spirited as ever, the left-wingcould not resist suggesting he was past his sell-by date.Not by such a margin as this preachy, unpopular rag which is about to go out of print.Those politicians who believe we mustto the EU’s totalitarian embrace are grievously out of step.Yes, Brexit has been botched, both by Theresa May and by Brexiteers themselves. There may be trouble ahead.But those who voted in their millions in  to leave have not budged. If anything, their mood has hardened.In a second referendum, a straight choice between Leave and Remain would turn Brexit into a landslide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ministers offer warm words on changes to come.But it’s time for a little more action, and a little less conversation.A DAMNING new book reveals the man his followers call “JC” is certainly no messiah.We know Jeremy Corbyn’s politics are potty, potentially leading us to a similar economic ruin to that inflicted on long-suffering Venezuelans.But it’s his personality that truly condemns him.He is not up to the job of leading Britain.SPARE us the Beeb’s bleating about how hard it’ll be to continue dishing out free licences for the over-s.The giveaway was a Gordon Brown electoral bribe and it is simply too much for the taxpayer to continue funding.If the BBC want to keep it free, the cash should come from their own bloated empire.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their foolishness means Britain must give away a fixed . per cent of national income at a time when global poverty is plummeting due to capitalism, scientic progress and technological advances.Now some Tories are trying to find ways to keep their promise to hit this aid target, while spending the money in fresh ways. That exposes the ­shallowness of ministers’ ­posturing as heroic saviours of the poor and dispossessed.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt told the Cabinet last month this level of aid spending was “unsustainable” and money should be shted to domestic priorities.She has floated the idea of ­building new ships for the Royal Navy from the aid ­budget by using them for humanitarian operations.And she knows the issue will rear up in any forthcoming Tory leadership battle.Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson chipped in, saying Britain needs more control over what counts as foreign aid under international rules — and that it should go towards boosting British foreign policy objectives.His move was linked to a report by former soldier turned Tory MP Bob Seely arguing that Britain should simply define its own aid spending to include our ­“strategic goals”.Yet they all miss the obvious solution. Just DITCH the target and abandon the  law binding us to it — one that makes the Department for International Developmentthe only ministry that must explain itself to MPsit fails to spend enough.This silly UN target is an historic anachronism devised by campaigners half a century ago based on flawed, outdated economic data.It makes no sense to rely on a fixed spending target based on national income over needs in poor places — as predicted by a former Tory Chancellor, respected Labour peers and a British economist who won the Nobel Prize for their expertise in poverty.One horried DfID minister confessed to me he thought spending was at least TRIPLE what it should be — yet whenever he tried to thwart wasteful projects, they simply bounced back from officials on to his desk again.It was no surprise to find those pen-pushers in the poverty relief department are among the best-paid bureaucrats in Whitehall.This torrent of cash has fuelled a self-serving aid industry stuffed with fat cats on six-figure salaries in charities and private firms.These people are so focused on protecting their valuable brands that some of the best-known organisations covered up abuse, rape, malpractice and theft.Their political paymasters pose as municent saviours of the world. Yet as I have seen on three continents, much of the money taken from taxpayers is blown on ludicrous projects based on bogus statistics — and ends up doing more harm than good by fostering conflict and undermining democracy.I was in Ghana last year, investigating a UK-funded scheme to pour cash into a few villages to prove aid works.“Far from breaking the poverty trap, the project does not appear to have reduced poverty or hunger at all,” concluded DfID’s own report.Yet we give cash to fast-emerging powerhouses such as China and India.We give cash to countries riddled with corruption, such as Uganda, where I found officials inflating the number of refugees to grab more funds from foreign donors.We give cash to places that have space programmes, even their own aid agencies.And we pour cash into countries run by gangsters spending huge sums on weapons — and in Rwanda’s case, on the brutal president’s favourite Premier League football club, Arsenal.Even North Korea, which runs massive death camps under a bloodstained family dictatorship, has been a beneficiary of UK aid. This is what happens when politicians prioritise spin and spending over needs and reality.Holland has showed a country can get off this hook. It abandoned the target and found the anticipated fuss died down quickly.The sht led to renewed focus on efficient spending, with fewer countries receiving donations. “We were surprised it was so easily dealt with,” one insider told me.Dutch spending has dipped from . per cent of national income in  to . per cent last year and will fall again over the coming years.Let us welcome the dawning realisation in Westminster that fixating on an aid target has been a dire failure.Instead of tinkering with definitions — or deceiving voters by slipping domestic spending under the foreign aid banner — politicians should accept their mistake and abandon that daft targetOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The BBC — fuelled by £billion of public money — has expanded into a state-backed media monster encroaching on areas that should be none of its business, from trivial “clickbait” stories to lestyle advice.After all, the BBC Charter states that it should “provide impartial news and information to help people understand  the world around them. It should offer depth and analysis not widely available from other UK news providers”.Somewhere, this has gone very wrong.It churns out so much stuff online that it could be renamed the British Publishing Corporation.In the process, the monster is devouring the market for everything from local newspapers to gossip websites.Why does “our” national broadcaster now feel obliged to publish “news” stories such as the classic “Serial poopers: What makes people poop in public ” The BBC is also hopelessly addicted to pumping out recipes. Type in “spaghetti bolognese” on Google and the first result that s is from BBC Good Food — a commercial site that trades on the broadcaster’s brand.Why is the BBC even in the already-crowded recipe market  Never heard the one about “too many cooks” By stretching its insensitive tentacles into local areas from its London and Salford HQs, the BBC has contributed to wrecking the local and regional Press, longstanding voices of real communities.At least  local and regional titles have closed since , as circulation halved from .million weekly in  to .million in .Since , the number of regional journalists has also been halved, to around ,.An estimated  per cent of the country now has no daily or weekly title.A robotic BBC web page is no substitute for local Press coverage of council meetings and court proceedings.And yet the money pours in to fund this expansion way beyond its remit.Last year the BBC spent £million on BBC Online and “Red Button” services. The national and local Press are under siege from the tech giants and their BBC collaborators. But this is about more than newspaper self-interest.The future of dirt-digging journalism and democratic debate is at stake.Cairncross estimates that “legacy newsbrands” — aka national and local newspapers — are responsible for around  per cent of all original news journalism in the UK, more than broadcasters and online-only outlets put together. That seems an underestimate.The role of the Press in reporting the news is not just a matter of historical “legacy”. As one ex-editor of a London local paper observes, “councillors and crooks must surely feel relaxed” without local hacks watching and reporting what they are up to.Every big story of recent years was broken by newspapers, from the fire risk Vauxhall Zafira and how Age UK pushed expensive power deals to OAPsto Philip Green gagging reports of sexual and racial harassment .Even last year’s most popular BBC-based story — the snogging scandal on Strictly Come Dancing — was a Sun on Sunday exclusive, before the BBC did its usual parasitical trick of topping Google searches for articles about “the Strictly Curse”.The newspaper tradition of long-form writing and forensic examination will continue to struggle as the online purveyors suck up adverts for cheap and cheerful clickbait.The print medium remains unmatched for serious analysis.Yet the BBC’s self-aggrandising aim is now to expand its global audience further, rather than meet the needs of the underserved as a public service broadcaster surely should.Thus the social media chief of BBC News, Mark Frankel, boasts of the corporation having on Facebook “the largest news page and total fanbase of any news organisation in the world”.The publicly funded BBC need not care that the tech giants don’t pay for stories, as for them Facebook is just a free publicity funnel.That alliance makes it even harder for the rest of the media to take a stand against being royally ripped off.Auntie is effectively in league with greed-driven tech giants.What of the output of all these BBC s  They claim to be a beacon of liberal ersity.The one thing the BBC can’t tolerate, however, is ersity of opinion.It is a bastion of illiberal luvvie smugness, peddling its elitism as the centre ground, blasting out conformist propaganda in Brexit-bashing  debates and Brexit-bashing comedy shows.Lord Reith, the first BBC chief, wanted the then-monopoly corporation to “inform, educate and entertain” the public, from the point of view of the British Establishment.Reith’s successors might have quite a dferent world view.But the new BBC establishment —  managers paid between £, to £, a year,  on between £, to £, — would love to have a state-backed news monopoly again, educating and informing the ignorant public, whether we like it or not.Those of us who appreciate the importance of a vibrant and erse media to democracy, should tell the BBC to get its tanks off the free Press’s lawn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he’s broken it, Mills  Boon style, “into a million pieces”.No one is suggesting that Meghan isn’t upset by the way her father and other off-message relatives have behaved — who wouldn’t be But this supposedly “private” attempt to build bridges lacks authenticity.Decades of dealing with PR spin designed to deflect suspicious journalists away from the real storyhas taught me to trust my gut instinct.And given Thomas’s previous form on speaking to the Press, it’s telling me that Meghan wrote this rather staged letter in the expectation that he would leak it and, therefore, seamlessly allow her to peddle her own narrative while maintaining the cover of the innocent party who has been betrayed by her own father yet again.But Thomas kept the letter under wraps. Until, that is, he was baited in to defending himself against claims made by some of Meghan’s close friends, who spoke anony-mously , about the duchess’s plight to the US-based People magazine.One said: “After the wedding she wrote him a letter. She’s like, ‘Dad, I’m so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship’.”Look, Thomas Markle is by no means blameless. He did a deal with the paparazzi for staged photos, is clearly given to petulance, has only released the parts of the letter that suit him and, as the parent in this scenario, should be the one to stop this tit-for-tat soap opera and just shut the hell up.But equally, any sympathy one might have felt for Meghan in dealing with her off-message family is evaporating fast in the face of such a blatant PR exercise that has her manicured fingers all over it.One of the friends who spoke out has “let it be known” that the duchess herself knew nothing of them speaking to People magazine.Sorry, but I just don’t buy it. Meghan has form for dropping friends like hot potatoesthey displease her, so the notion that those who remain “close” would speak to the Press — anonymously or otherwise — without approval is, to my mind, utter bunkum.Which leads me to conclude that this was a ham-fisted, Hollywood-esque attempt to try to manipulate Press coverage and put a stop to, as her friends put it, the “global bullying” of The Duchess of Sussex. But it has backfired badly.Yes, plenty of the criticism levelled at Meghan is unfair, and some of it is downright offensive.But as the rest of the Royal Family could tell her, they’ve all suffered their share of brickbats over the years but come through it.How  By earning respect through dutul and consistent hard work, not demanding it early doors via an ill-conceived PR initiative.JENNIFER ANISTON has just celebrated her th birthday.Or “poor Jen” as she’s frequently referred to because she’s single and childless which, obviously, is something to be pitied because marriage and giving birth defines us.Meanwhile, back in the real world, the single le appears to suit the fierce Ms A very well indeed.She says she considered her marriages to be successful, but when the end came: “This is our one le and I would not stay in a situation out of fear. Fear of being alone.“To stay in a marriage based on fear feels like you’re doing your one le a disservice.”She’s right, of course. But moving on is far simpler when you don’t have children together.If you do, then taking the decision to break up the family home is a far tougher one.Because your kids only have “one le” too.NOW US teenager Ethan Lindenberger has turned , he has finally had the MMR vaccination while criticising his “anti-vaxxer” movement parents for refusing to give it to him when he was younger.His mother, Jill Wheeler, who believes that vaccinations cause illnesses such as autism, says his decision is “insulting” and a “slap in the face”.Ethan, from Ohio, did his own research into the jab and commented on social media site Reddit, “God knows how I’m still alive” – presumably a reference to the fact that measles can be deadly.He probably swerved it thanks to all the parents who recognise the need for herd immunity and do have their children vaccinated.PARENTS in America say that regular viewing of children’s TV show Peppa Pig is causing their kids to start speaking in a British accent.Many moons ago, I went to collect my youngest from her first day at nursery and was greeted by an excited young assistant who hailed from Valencia.“I didn’t know your daughter could speak Spanish!”“Neither did I,” I replied.Turns out that rather too much time in front of Dora The Explorer had indeed been educational.LUNG cancer screening units are to be offered in supermarket car parks across the UK in an NHS bid to improve early detection rates.This reminds me of when a mobile cervical cancer screening unit was set up in a Birmingham car park in the s and an elderly lady approached the receptionist.She was directed to a curtained booth, given a smear test, then emerged to declare: “I’ve never had to do this to get a bus pass before.”NETFLIX documentary Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened is proof,needed, that all on Instasham etc is not what it seems.The Fyre festival was the brainchild of US “entrepreneur” Billy McFarland, now serving six years in prison for fraud, aided and abettedby a close coterie of consultants, marketeers, media experts andonline “influencers” who helped sell the dream of an exclusive event on a luxury, Bahamian island to unsuspecting, albeit wealthy punters who turned up to find a nightmare of soggy tents, bad food and no headline acts.Among those who appeared in a promotional video and posted the event’s distinctive “orange tile” to their millions of followers to help drive ticket sales were models Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski.Most notably, model Kendall Jenner was paid an eye-watering , via wire transfer for just one post about it to her million-plus followers.It shows with compelling clarity that while the power of A-list, online influence is real, what’s being promoted can sometimesbe a Grade A dud.So, buyer beware of those “influencers” who only post for favours or cash.They’re just the social media version of the old-fashioned freeloader.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These include repealing the so-called Swedish derogation, which allows employers to pay their agency workers less.Speaking in the Commons she said: “We are committed to enforcing holiday pay for the most vulnerable workers.“Not just protecting workers’ rights, but extending them.”Labour MPs are demanding that as well as protection for workers they also want the Government also cements environmental protections that would ban US meat such as hormone-treated beef.The Sun last week revealed the Government had put plans to announce a new Workers Rights Bill on the back burner.

But what do you reckon the likelihood is of the deadline being put back  I’ll bet it is.Olly Robbins thinks it’s likely. He’s a civil servant and the Prime Minister’s chief negotiator to the EU. He was overheard jabbering about the whole business in a bar in Brussels. And he saidthere WERE a delay, it would most likely be a long one.We’ll probably all be here this time next year, then, in exactly the same position.By which time the deal will be so watered down, the whole point will have been lost. It’s pretty close to that stage right now.Why has this happened  Because our establishment do not want us to leave. And while they may pay lip service to “respecting the voice of the people”, they don’t remotely mean it. They never did.And so, on the one hand we have establishment voices — Blair, Mandelson, Heseltine — and a growing number of current politicians demanding we must have another vote. Because we got it wrong last time.The European Union has a history of ignoring popular votes and getting countries to run the vote again, after a slew of propaganda about why the people were so wrong.Then, on the other hand, we have a Prime Minister who voted Remain leading our negotiations. And at every stage of the process more and more has been given away.We started from a position of weakness by allowing the EU to dictate the order of the negotiations. So they got to demand things from us — such as extortionate amounts of money — before we even got down to talking about our trading relationship.And at every stage the deal has got weaker. Every time she came back from Brussels, something more had been given away. Until we reach today’s position, where the deal before us isn’t really leaving the EU at all.We’ll still be tied to the customs union for the foreseeable future. We will still have the horrible European Court of Justice telling us what we can and can’t do for another two years.And there are plenty of people who believe that the famous issue of the Northern Ireland backstop is simply an attempt to get us to remain, for ever, inside the customs union.Here’s what I think will happen.Brexit will, in the end, be delayed. And by the time a deal is put before us again — months down the line — it will bear no real resemblance to “leaving the European Union”.And so those of us who have no trust in our liberal establishment, because we know what scant respect it has for democracy, will be able to say: “Told you so.

The truth is that Meghan is not remotely being hunted by photographers and enjoys extraordinary freedoms.The paparazzi do not stalk her like they did the Princess of Wales — although they were often tipped off about where Diana would be.Snappers were told  when she was going for lunch  with a friend, dressed up to the nines, or out for a night on the town in a sizzling frock. She had her favourite writers and her favoured photographers.But the only paparazzi pictures ever to have been published of Meghan were taken when the story first broke that she was romantically linked with Harry.This was a genuine news story. But because their media minders at Kensington Palace refused to issue an official photo of the couple together, they had created a market for one, and every paparazzo was desperate to get the first photo of them together.Since then, in all her public engagements, she has been closely monitored by the Palace Press team. Even her wedding pictures were so tightly controlled that just one Press agency was allowed to photograph the marriage service inside St George’s Chapel in Windsor last May.As a result, Meghan can quite happily live as a semi-private citizen in her palace.She comes and goes when and where she wants, with no photographers following her.We know precious little about the le she and Harry lead in London or at their luxury bolthole in Oxfordshire.Yes, she likes Soho Farmhouse and she writes on bananas — but that’s about it.Like everyone in the public eye, she is trolled on social media. Palace aides supposedly “spend hours” deleting hateful comments — but why bother  Why not simply ignore it  Their PR advisers hope to bypass the traditional media by controlling the photographs and stories they release.Meghan deleted her own social media accounts when she and Harry became engaged.  Perhaps the Royal Family should do the same. Instagram does not equal real le.When The Sun accurately reports about Meghan in fairly harmless stories, their frankly second-rate PR people set lawyers on us.Yet the biggest invasion of her privacy was triggered by Meghan herself, after she gave consent to friends to talk to People magazine in America last week about the awful relationship she has with  her dad.Although there have been stories about the “dficult Duchess” and the fall-out with Kate, most of her problems stem from back home in the USA.Meghan’s father Thomas Markle, her half-sister Samantha — who Meghan says she barely knows — and her cannabis-grower half-brother Thomas Jr, have only ever said disparaging things about the Duchess.I suspect that Meghan knew the letter she sent to her dad last August would be published and she used it to make sure the world knew she was disgusted with the lies being told by her family.Meanwhile, in his bid to “protect” his we, Prince Harry — once the Press photographers’ favourite among the royals —  has gone from hero to zero in his relationship with the media.I have asked twice for Meghan to meet Britain’s royal correspondents but so far it has not happened. If she did, I am sure her profile would improve.Despite being surrounded by great wealth and privilege, the young royals seem to have been seduced by the cult of victimhood.Harry talked about his anxiety and stress and Meghan is a victim of “global bullying” — whatever that means.Meghan really needs to lighten up. So does Harry.The pair of them should look across the road at Harry’s father, the Prince of Wales, and his lovely we Camilla, who has had more hostile Press coverage than any other member of  the Royal Family, including Diana.But they just worked harder and harder to win people over, and Camilla’s approval rating is now sky high and she will certainly be our Queen.Every job I have been on with Meghan she has been the star of the show. She engages brilliantly with people and is a true royal star.My main hope is that this phoney war with the media — that they started and which has now been  intensied by their friend Clooney — comes to an end before the Press loses interest.Newspapers and websites could, after all, simply stop covering Harry and Megan’s engagements, which I’m not sure would please either of them.So stick to acting, George, because there is no part for you in this royal soap opera.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The skin and ear lips are what move primarily.And while the five-year-old pooch does have a few other medical challenges, Heather says Toads le is mostly normal.She doesnt hear, see or smell very well because everything in her head is misaligned, but otherwise shes totally normal, said Heather.She is very devoted and loyal to her family. She thinks shes a lap dog and always insists on sitting on my lap.All of the other dogs move out of the way for her, everyone has accepted that she gets special attention because our bond is so tight.Other mainstays at Mutt Misfits include Scary Jack, who owes his unusual appearance to a severe case of puppy strangles.Heather said: The charity was formed because in shelter settings there arent many organisations that specialise in the special needs pups.Most rescue groups take in highly adoptable pups from shelters and re-home them. We focus on animals with major medical issues and saving the sick and injured pets.We like to help people to understand that animals dont have to be perfect to make perfect pets.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m a drug trafficker. I don’t kidnap or steal or extort or anything like that.”Over the last few weeks the American-born beauty queen, now , has been a fixture at the trial of the century, hearing damning testimony from his mistresses, harrowing evidence he had drugged and raped underage girls and stories of torture and murder.Some claimed the presence of the of the elegantly turned out Emma, in pencil skirts, stiletto heels and  a cloud of perfume, was for the benefit of the judges and jury in the New York courtroom.But her support – demonstrated by the matching burgundy jackets the couple wore in the New York courtroom – appeared unshakeable.She told the New York Times: I dont know my husband as the person they are trying to show him as but rather I admire him as the human being that I met, and the one that I married.The daughter of Ines Coronel Barreras, a medium-ranking lieutenant in the Sinaloa cartel that El Chapo ran, Emma Coronel grew up in the world of drug deals and murder.Despite her unflinching loyalty during the trial, hers was no fairy tale wedding but what many have called an “arranged marriage” - one which she had little choice but to accept.In the run up to the pageant, it is reported that El Chapo bribed the judges to let Emma win - for a very good reason.A Mafia tradition - which dates back to  when Sam Giancana married the then Miss Sinaloa -  dictates that mob bosses should marry beauty queens, and Emma was the prize El Chapo wanted for himself.Born in Santa Clara, Calornia, she grew up in Sierra Madre, Mexico’s biggest drug-producing region.At , she met El Chapo at a dance and a few months later she entered the beauty pageant in her village of Canelas, which she won.As she celebrated her win, El Chapo, who was surrounded by s of henchmen with guns on show, announced he would marry her.After tying the knot, the newlyweds made an early exit and police, who had wind of the wedding, arrived too late to catch the elusive quarry.For the next few years, Emma moved from place to place with her husband, staying away from the eyes of the law.In , heavily pregnant with twins, Emma drove to Calornia to ensure her children – Emalí Guadalupe and Maria Joaquína – had US citizenship.Seizing the chance, the police turned up at the hospital to question her but she refused to give away her husbands whereabouts and they left frustrated.El Chappo, now , was far from the conventional father.When the twins were six months old, he sent Emma a text saying “Our Kikiis fearless. I’m going to give her an AK-, so she can hang with me.”The drug lord – who has  children by ious wives and mistresses – also kept numerous lovers after the couple wed.The trial heard that El Chapo - said to be worth £ billion - paid for liposuction for one of his female drug runners, who then became his mistress.Whether she knew about is many affairs is not known, but she was said to have “cackled” in the public gallery when one his lovers was reduced to tears in the witness box.Other than that, the stoical we showed no signs of emotion, smiling and waving at her husband in the dock.In court, he was delighted to see his loyal we, greeting her every morning with a wave or blowing her a kiss.Emma kept a low profile in the early years of the marriage but, after El Chappo’s arrest in , she gave a fiercely defensive interview to the LA Times, refuting allegations he drugged and raped women and girls.She said:  He would be incapable of touching a woman with bad intentions, of trying to make her do something she didnt want to do.”Around the same time, she took to Twitter to voice her feelings.On  January , as El Chapo was being extradited to the USA, she tweeted in Spanish: We both knew that to make us a reality we would have to pay a huge price: distance, time, challenges and sacrices. It was worth it.She has since switched to Instagram, posting bikini selfies and pictures of her glamorous le to , followers.In September, she posted a series of pictures of her daughters’ Barbie themed seventh birthday.She posed in front of a le-sized Barbie-themed palace that she had constructed for the events and was pictured with her daughters, dressed in identical pink dresses and clutching Louis Vuitton handbags worth £, each.She has also been seen with a £ Prada handbag, one of many designer bags she owns.A retired Drug Enforcement Administration agent told the New York Post: “The whole story with her is so surreal.She goes around and flaunts her wealth and lestyle in front of everyone’s face.”Other pictures on her Instagram include a firing range shot, with her shooting a semi-automatic weapon.There are also numerous images of her in designer clothing, including a floor gold evening gown.As the trial ended, earlier this month, she posted a photo of the courthouse and wrote: Everything that was discussed in the trial about Joaquín, good and bad, does not change in any way the way I think about him.After her husband was found guilty of  federal crimes yesterday, they gave each other the thumb up she smiled, waved and touched her heart in a gesture of affection.On Instagram she wrote: “God gave me your love, your smile and your kisses so that I never forget what it is to be happy.”But the outpouring of love and loyalty from El Chappo’s beautul we have not convinced everyone – with many believing it’s all for show.“Do these people covering the trial really believe in the beautul love story between El Chapo and Emma ” says Anabel Hernández, the journalist who first interviewed Emma in .“Oh come on. She’s a distraction, and that in itself is important to El Chapo and the lawyers”.Growing up in the heart of gangland Mexico, Emma was schooled in the strict code of conduct that rules the criminal gangs from a young age.She is used to staying silent and steadfast as loved ones go down for their crimes - her father and older brother Ines were arrested and jailed in  and Emma’s younger brother Edgar arrested for helping El Chapo escape from his shower at Altiplano jail in .But, even with her husband locked away for le, the code will rule the rest of her le.While the government can take whatever money they can find, she and her children will be amply provided for from the ill-gotten gains her husband has stashed out of sight,  according to one crime fighter, who has investigated organized crime for  years.The crime fighter told the Daily Beast: “She will not be living in some hovel in Mexico City — I assure you of that. The children will be provided for, they’ll be taken are of.”He added that she is in no danger of others gang cartels trying to hurt her because rivals won’t want a tit for tat war to touch their own families.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out.”Enriched uranium is a critical component for making nuclear weapons and in nuclear power stations and by curbing the amount Iran produce is a way to curb the number of weapons produced.As part of the agreement, Iran also agreed to only enrich their uranium up to . per cent over the next  years and they agreed to reduce their gas centruges for  years.Gas centruges are used to separate dferent types of uranium which allows specic types to then be used to manufacture nuclear weapons or generators.Iranian nuclear facilities were limited to a single facility with only first-generation centruges for  years and other nuclear facilities had to be converted into other use.In addition, they were barred from building any more heavy-water faculties - a type of nuclear reactor which uses heavy wateras a coolant to maintain temperatures in the reactor.Also under the agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency was granted regular access to all Iranian nuclear facilities to ensure Iran maintains the deal.The deal said thatIran abides by the deal it would receive relief from the US, European Union, and the United Nations Security Council on all nuclear-related economic sanctions.The President also views the EU as a foe on trade.He said: “Well I think we have a lot of foes. I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade.Now you wouldn’t think of the European Union but they’re a foe."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000004507473.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"oasis liam noel gallagher fan tattoo harry potter jimmy carr","story":"Internet users claim the mans black and white inking looks more like Jimmy Carr and Harry Potter - rather than the famous rockstars.It was posted on an Oasis fan page, with the user writing: When you ask for a tattoo of the Gallagher brothers but get Jimmy Carr and Harry Potter instead.The tats appeared to be inked on each leg - with fans saying Noel Gallagher looks more like Jimmy Carr the comedian, rather than the famous Oasis guitarist.Meanwhile, the other tattoo - with a buttoned-up collar and specs - was mocked for looking more like Potter.Fans who shared the tweet noticed even more famous doppelgangers, including serial killer Rosemary West, footballer Kyle Lafferty, and TV personality Paddy McGuinness.Instead of the Harry Potter and Jimmy Carr duo, one fan tweeted that the tattoo looks more similar to fictional Adrian Mole, and professional footballer Nigel Clough.One cynical follower Tweeted: Serves you right for wanting a tattoo of them b***ends anyway doesnt it.The terrible tattoo of the Oasis rockstars is among many celebrity inking fails that end up looking nothing like their pictures.Last October a tattoo of Alan Shearer went viral for having little resemblance to him, and the football pundit responded with a comical selfie backing the awful tattoo version of himself. pay for your stories!

Her parents are from Bangladesh — raising the bar to re-entry here.The Sun understands that permanent exclusion is one of three options open to officials.Alternatives are to prosecute her in her absence for being in a designated terror area — or to allow her tobut under heavy monitoring.In a brazen interview with The Times, Begum said she wanted toso the NHS could care for her unborn baby — due any day.With no sign of remorse, she claimed her “normal” le at former ISIS stranglehold Raqqa, was “the one I wanted”.She even admitted that seeing a severed head of a captured fighter for the first time “didn’t faze me at all”.Security Minister Ben Wallace issued a blunt warning to Begum. He said: “I’m not putting at risk British people’s lives to go and look for terrorists or former terrorists in a failed state.“People now want to come back to a country they actually hate  Well, actions have consequences”. Tory MPs backed the Government’s tough line.Mansfield MP Ben Bradley said: “Nobody could ever know her full and true intentions of ing to the UK, and we should not risk lives at home.”Another Tory MP, Robert Halfon, said: “I’m against her coming back because you have to give a signal.”Ministers have said they do not plan to launch a rescue mission.And there is no British consulate in Syria to support Begum.Sources indicated the Government had three main options in dealing with her.The first is to ban her from Britain permanently — stripping her of UK citizenship.The second is to prosecute her in her absence for being in a designated terror area, under new powers that came into force this week.The third is to allow the teenager toonly to then slap a strict TPIM — Terrorism Prevention Investigation Measures order — on her to closely monitor and restrict her movements.Other legal options include issuing a temporary exclusion order — used just nine times in .It bars a British citizen from coming back to the UK unless they agree to be investigated, monitored and de-radicalised.Begum’s family told how her mother wept after speaking to her on the phone.Her brother-in-law Mohammed Rehman said: “There’s a mixture of elation and sorrow.“We are happy she’s alive but sad things have come to this.“She’s put us through a lot of heartache. She’s also gone through a very dficult time herself.“Until the interview, we didn’t knowshe was alive or not. There has been no contact with her in almost two years.“Shamima’s mum just cried and told her to come home.”Mr Rehman added: “We want her to come back so she can be re-educated.“As a family we can’t understand how her head was turned like this and why she thought going to Syria was a good idea.“I can understand why people in this country are angry and don’t want her back. What she’s done doesn’t portray Islam in a good light.“She was only  when she went to Syria. We’re appealing for compassion and understanding on her behalf.”Begum is believed to be a British-born citizen, which in the past would have prevented the Government from stripping her of her nationality.Only dual-nationals or those who had become British citizens — known as “naturalisation” — could be hit with “deprivation orders” removing their UK status.EvenBegum did , she would face months of grilling by spooks and anti-terror cops. There would also be intensive monitoring with her threat assessed by MI and fed into a matrix of , “subjects of interest”.ISIS is known to have given foreign women explosives and weapons training since at least .Begum fled Bethnal Green, East London, with pals Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase in February . The three flew to Istanbul, Turkey, before crossing the border into Syria.Sultana was killed in a Russian air strike in Raqqa aged  in . Another girl from Bethnal Green, Sharmeena Begum, now , also travelled to Syria two months earlier.It is not knownshe has survived recent bomb strikes.On arrival in Syria, Begum wed a Dutch jihadi, Yago Riedijk. They had two children. Son Jerah, died aged eight months from malnutrition in December, and daughter Sarayah died aged  months in January.Begum was living in Baghuz — under threat from Syrian Democratic Forces. She fled a fortnight ago while her husband surrendered to the SDF.Begum was taken by bus to a refugee camp in north east Syria.A Dutch anti-terror source said: “The chances that Riedijk was not in touch with members of the group planning this bloodbath is nil.“The British girl is being described as a vulnerable victim but she married an extremely dangerous man who waged jihad at home as well as in Syria.”Police smashed the Arnhem cell last year as the men were about to launch their attack.An undercover officer had infiltrated their ranks and supplied them with dummy weapons which failed to fire as police swooped.Investigators learned of their plot to use car bombs, grenades and AK assault rles at a major event, believed to be a rock festival.Their plan was to walk among innocent revellers in a line killing everyone in their path with rles and grenades before detonating a huge car bomb.Dutch police said Riedijk, who surfaced in Syria in , was one of  Muslim men from Arnhem identied as having been radicalised.Of the , six travelled to Syria where at least one has died and five have ed from the war zone.Riedijk, said to have been wounded in fighting then tortured by ISIS chiefs who branded him a spy, was separated from his British bride as they fled ISIS’s last stronghold in Baghuz.He was understood to have surrendered to a Syrian rebel group but his whereabouts were unknown.She told The Times: “The caliphate is over. There was so much oppression and corruption that I don’t think they deserved victory.“I know what everyone at home thinks of me as I have read all that was written about me online.“But I just want to come home to have my child.”There remains doubt over whether UK prosecutors could charge her.But Nazir Afzal, a former CPS chief crown prosecutor, said: “At the very least there is the potential charge of being a member of a banned terrorist organisation in IS.”He warned thatBegum ed she could face having her baby taken away by social services. He added: “If the authorities felt it fitting, the child should be taken from her.”A Whitehall source said: “Whilst Begum’sis fraught with dficulty, it would represent huge intelligence value.”Amira Abase’s dad, Abasse Hussen, , admitted that he expected his daughter to face actionshe ever ed. But he stressed: “These girls were young.”Security sources told The Sun up to four more Brits linked to ISIS fighters had sought sanctuary in refugee camps in recent weeks. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He added: The PM still has additional time to negotiate deal revisals Parliament said it needs.He predicted the second meaningful vote would come before the end of February, when MPs will be presented with a stark choice between backing Mrs Mays deal or crashing out of the EU without a deal.As the PM still did not have a deal for MPs to vote on today she put down a supposedly neutral motion instead.It said MPs welcomed the last set of votes in the House of Commons where they forced her to go back to Brussels, but also accepted that the House didnt want to leave without a deal - something Brexiteers said was ruling out a No Deal.Steve Baker insisted the PM must now fully endorse the so-called Malthouse compromise, an alternative plan thrashed out by MPs from across the spectrum, as the only way forward.And Jacob Rees-Mogg added: The message tonight is that there is a majority for the Malthouse compromise, but the Government needs to work with its backbenchers, rather than against them.Shortly after the result Jeremy Corbyn said the vote showed there was no majority for the Prime Ministers course of action for dealing with Brexit.And he blasted: The Government cannot keep on ignoring Parliament and heading for March  without a coherent plan.Remainer David Lammy stormed: This is a Valentine’s Day massacre for the government and a damning indictment of the Prime Minister’s Brexit plan.Tory Nick Boles said he hoped the penny will now drop with Prime Minister and her Chief Whip that the hardliners in the ERG want a  No Deal Brexit and will stop at nothing to get it.Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood hit out at the Brexiteers in an extraordinary rant, saying:They caused this tonight and they are acting as a party within a party and that is frustrating.There is a deal to be decided, there is still work to be done, and yet tonight we see the ERG halting the Government, not supporting the Conservative Party. That is not necessary and its also provocative.The defeat is likely to damage Mrs Mays confidence in talks with Brussels, as they will be sceptical as to whether she can secure a majority among her own MPs for any plan at all.Steve Barclay revealed the PM will fly to Brussels next week for fresh talks with Jean Claude Juncker in a last ditch attempt to persuade them not to derail her plans.And No insisted No Deal was still on the table - but the assurances werent enough for dozens of members of of the European Research Group.Instead she just said the House welcomed last weeks votes - accepting Sir Graham Bradys change to go back to Brussels and ask for more, and a non-binding amendment to rule out a No Deal Brexit.But it was slapped down when MPs said it would effectively rule out no deal, throwing a spanner in the works of the PMs plans.CORBYN AMENDMENT -

Tory rebels ganged up on the Prime Minister after what was supposed to be a House of Commons love-in turned into a Valentines Day massacre. They were holding a supposedly boring, run-of-the-mill vote to keep calm and carry on talks with the EU. But Tories who backed Mrs May two weeks ago threw out her strategy in a row over whether she is ruling out No Deal. Also, to add insult to injury, she was forced to back down and publish secret papers that show the impact of leaving on March  without agreement.  Tonights vote wasnt legally binding. But it fundamentally weakens Theresa May at the moment of maximum danger. So what has actually happened - and what will happen next  Here is a quick guide.  MPs held a vote on whether to reiterate backing for Theresa Mays Brexit strategy - which they agreed two weeks ago. Back in January, they agreed to send her back to Brussels to renegotiate the backstop - a clause in her eal which could trap the UK under EU customs rules from  January . Yet this time, the Prime Minister lost by a majority of  after MPs voted - against her motion. Why, you ask  Its all about tricky wording. MPs were being asked to reiterate support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this House on  January. The problem is, that approach had two parts. The first was changing the backstop, which Tory Brexiteers support. But the second was to reject the idea of a No Deal Brexit - which Tory Leavers say must stay on the table. So they revolted en masse.  abstained on the motion and another  voted against - which left an open goal for Labour to defeat it.  Tonights vote is not legally binding. But it massively weakens Theresa May just as she is trying to put up a united front against Brussels. The PMs been through the mill the last few months. On January , her -page Brexit deal suffered the heaviest defeat in Commons history. Finally, on January , she won a glimmer of hope. MPs actually agreed on something - thatshe changes the backstop, theyll pass her deal. Coarsing with adrenaline, the battle-hardened Prime Minister seized this vote with both hands. She marched back to the EU and demanded changes to her deal - saying she finally had Parliament on her side. But now its clear she doesnt have Parliament on her side. Instead, what she called a substantial and sustainable majority for her plans has slipped away. It exposes her, and her fragile parliamentary maths, leaving her naked just as she was meant to be marching in armour-clad with the EU. Tory ministers were pretty clear about how damaging itd beshe lost. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay warned EU leaders would be watching the votes for any sign our resolve is weakening. We should not give them that excuse not to engage, he said.  In the short term, arrogant Theresa May vowed to completely ignore the Parliamentary defeat and carry on regardless. The stubborn PM was not even in the House of Commons for the humiliating vote. Jeremy Corbyn demanded she come face the music, saying: Tonight’s vote shows there is no majority for Parliament for the Prime Minister’s course of action. But minutes later, Downing Street released a statement attacking Jeremy Corbyn and proclaiming she will continue to pursue talks with the EU. It means cross-party talks with Labours leader, who had offered to back Mrs Mayshe supports an EU customs union, look dead in the water. Further talks between the Prime Minister and the EU, though, are planned for later in the month.  In the longer term, the Prime Minister is in huge trouble. All this debate is counting down to a final meaningful vote on her revised Brexit deal in the House of Commons. In recent days, its emerged she could push this back as far as March  - four days before we leave the EU. And MPs are absolutely determined to stop this blackmail. Jeremy Corbyn warned: She cannot keep on just running down the clock and hoping that something will turn up that will save the day. And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford demanded she put the meaningful vote before Parliament next week. MPs will hold another string of votes on February , where they could vote to delay Brexit or back a second referendum. That date is now being trumped as the high noon - the moment where Theresa May could have her arm twisted into abandoning her reckless plan or holding an early vote. The problem is, what will MPs actually vote on  The EU has made clear its not going to budge on that Northern Ireland backstop. She wants a time limit, exit clause or alternative arrangements. But its looking like the best she can hope for is some keyhole surgery, inserting brief words of assurance or guarantee into the -page Brexit deal. If this isnt enough for MPs, then boy, howdy - shell be really stuffed.  Does it make No Deal Brexit more likely  In a word, yes, it looks like it. Ian Wright, Chief Executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said: “The defeat of the Government motion tonight will increase fears among food and drink manufacturers that there is now a diminishing prospect of rescue from the catastrophe of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit.” Labour MP Stephen Doughty of the Peoples Vote campaign said: Time is running out for Parliament to hold a meaningful vote on her Brexit deal andthere is no majority for it in the House of Commons then the only responsible way forward is to give the final say back to the public with a People’s Vote. PS: What ELSE happened tonight   There were a series of dferent votes tonight. Completely separately, Theresa May agreed to publish secret No Deal Brexit advice to avoid a Commons defeat. The Prime Minister caved to Tory rebels after they demanded to see a supposed official briefing document handed to the Cabinet. Mrs May had argued a Cabinet briefing, which MPs said showed the implications of No Deal Brexit on business and trade, was private advice and should not be published. But she said she would to cave to MPs demands after they threatened to put it to a vote tonight. InTory rebel Anna Soubry - who had led the cross-party bid - withdrew a Commons amendment that would have handed over the document. Meanwhile, Labour failed in a bid to stop Theresa May running down the clock and force a vote on her Brexit deal by February . MPs defeated Jeremy Corbyns amendment - after Tories refused to support it. And an SNP bid to delay Brexit by at least three months failed by  votes to  - despite a rebellion by  Labour MPs.

Business minister Richard Harrington lashed out at members of Jacob Rees-Moggs European Research Groupof Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers. He suggested members should defect to Nigel Farages new party because they are not Conservatives. Referring to the ERG, the minister told The House magazine: The Prime Minister has done a pretty good job of standing up to them up till now, but they were drinking champagne to celebrate her losing her deal and I regard that as being treachery.   He added: I read that Nigel Farage is setting up a new party called  Brexit  andI were them Id be looking at that, because that seems to reflect their views more than the Conservative Party does. They should read carefully what that partys got to offer, because in my view theyre not Conservatives. There are people who are very solid and stringent in their views andI were they I would be looking at a party that seems designed for them - Nigel Farages party. Mr Harrington, who backed Remain in the referendum, said it would give the ERG pleasureministers who shared his views onBrexitresigned.   He said: If we all resigned what would then happen  If I were in the ERG, it would give me a lot of pleasure to see us resign. But we cant give in to a minority of a minority, which is what the ERG are. Mr Harrington also dismissed the so-called Malthouse compromise, which is intended to try to bridge Tory isions onBrexit.   The minister said: Its basically regurgitated Canada Plus, which we know is not at all suited to our close relationship with the European Union, plus a bit of gloried number plate recognition kit, which theyve got there anyway. I think its just fancul nonsense. Mr Harrington has previously declared he is happy to be sacked by Theresa Mayshe objects to him speaking out about the dangers of leaving the EU without an agreement on March .

Giving evidence today, the accuseds mother said he was very drunk after drinking a bottle of wine and Mad Dog  at an exams party he held at their home. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she argued with her son before going to bed on the night six-year-old Alesha disappeared. In the morning, the mum told the court she woke up to hear people searching for the young girl. She says she checked her CCTV, which she had installed because a relative with dementia was moving in, to seeAlesha could be spotted walking by. Instead, footage showed her son leaving and ing to the property on three occasions throughout the night. The -year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denies raping and murdering Alesha, as well as charges of child abduction and defeating the ends of justice.  He has lodged a special defence of incrimination stating Ms McLachlan, the partner of Aleshas dad Robert MacPhail, committed the crime. Alesha was reported missing by her grandmother, Angela King, at .am on July , and the child’s body was found at the site of an abandoned hotel on the Isle of Bute just before am that day. During the fourth day of proceedings, the mother of the accused gave evidence and told of how her son was clever, popular and well-liked in school. The accused had lots of friends, was good at maths and did parkour, she told the court. The mother of the accused said she was aware he had been smoking cannabis from the age of  but wasnt really that bothered about it. The accused’s mother told the court her son held a post-exam party on the night before Alesha disappeared. She said the pair had an argument on the night and her son was very drunk and angry.  The accused had drunk a bottle of wine and Mad Dog , she said. He was very angry because his -year-old sister had left the house with his friends. The last of his friends left around .am and he remained in the house, she said. She said she tried to get him to phone his sister before going to bed She also explained a video security system had been installed in the house because a family member with dementia was moving in. The jury were shown footage of them rowing at .am on  July,  - the night Alesha went missing. She and her son can be heard shouting and swearing at each other. The accused’s mother went to bed and said she was awoken at .am to shouting in the street as people looked for Alesha.  After checking the back garden she woke up her son and askedhe knew anything about Alesha’s disappearance. He replied no and went back to sleep. She then went out with her dog and joined the search where she met Alesha’s family and reassured them everything would be OK. The accused’s mum said she checked the CCTV in her home after hearing about Alesha’s disappearance. She sawthe accused ing home around am and was unaware he had left the house.She had been looking at the footage to seeAlesha had walked past the house.  She then went further back in the CCTV to discover her son left in the direction of Rothesay town and passed Robert MacPhail’s home. He ed from a dferent direction and had a shower. He left again wearing only shorts and carrying a T-Shirt and jumped over a wall. He did not have any shoes on. He came back seven minutes later. When she asked what he was doing he told her he did not know and was maybe looking for his mobile.She said she noticed his feet were dirty.  She confronted him about leaving the house and recalled him saying: I dont know, I mustve been looking for my phone. But when asked by advocate depute Iain McSporran QCthat puzzled her, she replied: Yes. The accused’s mother said she decided to phone the police about the CCTV after speaking to a friend. She told her friend her son had been out of the house when Alesha disappeared. She told the police about the CCTV because she thought it would eliminate him from their enquiries. The mum said: But I didn’t think he had actually done anything, it was more to help the police and eliminate him from their inquiries. The court was then shown footage from .am which she said she assumed was him leaving for the first time.  The court was then shown footage of a person arriving back at the house at .am. The mother of the accused said she assumes it is her son. He jumps over wall and enters rear of house. CCTV shows the bathroom light coming on. Footage shows the accused leaving the property again wearing just shorts. A third clip, which the accuseds mother said she was not aware of is shown to the court.It shows the accused ing to the house before sprinting out again with what looks like a torch.

Alexander McLachlan, a welder, said he contacted police after making the discovery on the cameras fitted to his home in Marine Place, Rothesay. The -year-old said the footage, from .am on July , and shown to the jury, resembled somebody carrying something on their back. There was movement coming from the shelter, then somebody walking asthey were carrying something on their back, he said. Once he knew a child was missing, he told police he presumed the person walking was carrying a little girl. His sister-in-law Shari Strathie, , said CCTV from her home next door, also shown in court, featured a person carrying something on their front with legs hanging down.  The jury was also told today that Alesha had been smothered and suffered catastrophic injuries to her genital area. Pathologist John Williams said the youngster had more severe injuries to that part of her body than he had ever seen before. Alesha had a total of  separate injuries, he said. The High Court in Glasgow was shown graphic images of these, which judge Lord Matthews warned were distressing. A -year old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denies abducting the schoolgirl from the home her grandparents shared with her father on the Isle of Bute, raping and murdering her and attempting to hide evidence. Her body was found in a wooded area on the island on July  last year.  Dr Williams said his post-mortem examination of her body indicated the cause of death was signicant and forceful pressure to her neck and face. He said the injuries to her neck and face were consistent with being gripped and those to her nose and mouth were consistent with smothering. He added it was also possible her was windpipe pushed shut. Most of the the  injuries were caused by the nature of the ground she was lying on, the jury was told. Her injuries included tears to her private parts, one of which essentially obliterated part of her genital area and were consistent with severe and forceful inflicted penetration, which could have been caused by a body part or object. Advocate depute Iain McSporran QC asked him: Have you ever before seen injuries of these sort to the private parts  Dr Williams replied: No.  The pathologist said the soles of her feet were clean, consistent with her being picked up or otherwise taken to where she was found. Questioned by Brian McConnachie QC, for the accused, who described Aleshas injuries as catastrophic, Dr Williams said he had never been shown an object that could have caused them. The court also heard from the accuseds mother, who said her son had been drinking with friends at home early on July . She said they argued about damage to furniture and then she thought he had gone to bed. The following day she helped search for Alesha and later checked her CCTV system covering the front and back of her home had lived with her, and saw her son on the footage. The court was shown footage in which she identied her son leaving the home at .am on July , wearing all black, and ing at .am no longer wearing his black top. At .am, a light is turned on in the bathroom and he is seen leaving a minute later wearing only shorts and carrying an item.  He leaves the house again at .am, running off wearing shoes, shorts and a top before ing at .am. The mother said she told her son about the footage and asked him why he was out, to which he said: I dont know, I might have been looking for my phone. She asked himhe knew anything about the missing girl and he said no. His mother later phoned police to eliminate her son from inquiries, saying: Obviously I really didnt think he had anything to do with it whatsoever. After the police spoke to him she said he told her he was first out looking for cannabis and later for his phone. She said: I talked to him and tried to explain that whoever had done this to this little girl their DNA would be all over her. He was adamant, absolutely adamant, that he had nothing to do with it. There was no way they would find DNA on this little girl because he hadnt seen her and he hadnt been with her.  She was later shown pictures of a kne found on the shore, which she said is very similar to those in her kitchen but she had no idea how it got there. His mother was also shown jogging trousers and boxers at the shore, which she said looked like her sons. She described her son as clever at maths, well-liked and said he had lots of friends. The accused has lodged a special defence blaming Toni McLachlan - the girlfriend of Aleshas father Robert MacPhail - for the killing. During her evidence to the court on Wednesday she insisted she had had nothing to do with the girls death, telling jurors: I loved her to pieces. The trial continues.

She was already struggling to survive on the money she received due to a letime of severe mental health problems. This week, three years after his daughter’s suicide, Angela’s father, -year-old Donald Smith, received a cheque from the DWP for pound.. A letter said that Angela had, in fact, been underpaid by around pound a month from  to . Donald, now , says the money – around pound a month – “for Angela could have been the dference between le and death.” He adds that fears about money were “one of the principal reasons Angela took her own le.” The DWP says Angela was underpaid due to an “administrative error”.  The betrayal of Angela comes as the Labour Party launch a hard-hitting party political broadcast blaming a shameful , deaths on Tory austerity. The film, aired for the first time on Wednesday evening, says Tory cuts and NHS privatisation have caused a “national emergency”. The film explicitly links pound billion of cuts to health and social care and falling le expectancy and excess deaths in England. Donald first wrote to me in November , then aged . A heart-breaking letter enclosing the order of service from his daughter’s funeral. His beloved Angela, he said, had taken her own le after being told she faced a benefit reassessment, and having local psychiatric support withdrawn.   He has always blamed the DWP and austerity for Angela’s death. He also blames multiple failings by the now notorious Southern Health NHS Trust. At the time of her death, Angela’s case was even raised in Parliament by Luciana Berger MP, then shadow minister for Mental Health. “Do these people, the government ministers like Iain Duncan Smith, the pen pushers and bean counters, realise the misery and even death they are causing ” Donald says now. “Do they even care  I doubt it. It’s a lousy system that needs scrapping.” Donald’s comments come as a DWP minister, Sarah Newton claimed it is ‘shameful’ to claim benefit cuts have driven people to suicide. Sarah Newton accused critics of “deliberately misusing data” to say Tory welfare reforms are driving people to death. Meanwhile, James Cleverly, Deputy Chair of the Conservative Party, called the Labour broadcast “shameful scaremongering”. “They’re still at it now,” Donald says, talking about grandfather Jeff Hayward who this week won his appeal against being found fit for work – seven months after his death.  Mr Haywood had died in June after spending the last  months of his le battling for disability benefits. His family say the stress of his appeal and financial problems caused contributed to his death from a heart attack at the age of . Angela had been on the disability benefit ESA since August , but faced reassessment – which used to happen every two years – in . Before she died, she had spoken to her dad about friends facing similar problems who had recently taken their own lives. “This is the way they are trying to get rid of us, Dad, and for everyone that takes this way out, they probably open another bottle of champagne’,” she told Donald. Donald, a former factory worker, had spoken to his daughter on the Sunday before she died, and only realised later that she hadn’t ended the phone call with her usual “I love you, Dad”.  Now he says: “A more glaring example of how the benefits system’s gross inadequacies and mismanagement can impact profoundly on people with mental disabilities would be hard to find. To say it’s ironic, hardly covers it.” The Work Capability Assessment – or fit-for-work test – he says, “is long overdue to be scrapped”. The DWP says: “We want to ensure people receive the support they are entitled to and apologise for the error which resulted in Miss Smith receiving less in ESA support then she should have. We have paid full arrears to her family.” Meanwhile, partly because of cases like Angela’s ESA and Universal Credit Work Capability Assessments are no longer given to disabled people with the most severe and lelong conditions. Adding to her distress, Angela had recently been told she was no longer eligible to access mental health services she relied on, provided by Southern Health.  That is the same Trust linked to deaths including that of -year-old Connor Sparrowhawk, who drowned in the bath at a residential unit in their care in . Donald had been to her GP to beg for help, warning his daughter was suicidal, but to no avail. Donald is still unhappy with Southern Health’s report into Angela’s death, and the Trust remains in dialogue with him. Over three years since we first spoke, Donald has also lost his beloved we, and at  and in ill health himself, is still battling for answers. Knowing another , people have lost their lives to Tory austerity cuts responsible for brutal welfare reforms and decimated services, brings him no comfort.

Little Brooke Masterton, three, managed to cross two main roads and a bridge before she was found sobbing in her grandparents garden by a neighbour who then took her back to nursery. Her terried mum Nicole said she feared her daughter had been abducted when she found her knickers in the garden of her parent’s home in Evanton, in the Scottish Highlands. But in fact, a distressed Brooke had wet herself so removed her knickers and tights and left them in the garden.Nicole, , told The Daily Record : I was livid. I couldnt even speak. I was shaking with anger.“My head was absolutely spinning. I couldnt understand it. Why were Brookes pants there and she was nowhere in sight. So much was going through my mind but the one major thing was someones got her. “Brooke could have been killed or hit by a car or abducted. Theres no security over there and now Im being told by Highland Council that they cant put in some better security.She dropped Brooke off at Kiltearn Primary School s nursery at am as normal and went to help her elderly parents with their shopping.But when she got back to her parents’ house just before pm the scene before her left her frozen with fear.

Nicole ran straight to the school and demanded to know where her daughter was. I was shaking, I ran in and said ‘wheres Brooke . The secretary lady told me Brooke is in class. She said staff told her Brooke had gone missing from the playground. “It was explained that a neighbour who lives next-door to Brookes grandmother on Thomas MacIver Street found her crying in the garden and had taken her back to school. Nicole said: I couldnt believe what I was hearing. Brooke was crying and saying mummy I couldnt find you. I was shaking horribly. It was clear to me that someone had obviously turned a blind eye in that playground. Who in their right mind would allow a child to get out of their sight in a nursery playground    “Brooke had to cross two main roads and a bridge across a river to get up to my mothers. She might not have been here today. Every time we walk that road to nursery she tried to climb up the frame of that bridge. Imagineshed have done that that day without me there to stop her  Nicole said she phoned the police who investigated but concluded that it was a council matter. The mum-of-three claimed the only reason she was breaking her silence was because the council had turned down her request for better security at the nursery which is attached to the school. And she is keeping the little girl back from starting school this year unless security measures are put in place. I cant put here into P this year because of it because I do not feel it is safe. I can’t put her into a playground knowing that she can get out of it. Its just horrible.   Parent council chairwoman Annelie Graham said security was a concern”. She said: “The front entrance to the school was going to be completely overhauled and that was promised in November and it was going to be done by Easter-time. “Then we were told it was still to be confirmed butit has been shelved then we are going to make an official complaint. It’s something that does need to be sorted and it is a concern.

Hayley says it was her duty as a mother to plan an exercise regime for the young girl - including  sit ups, squats, lunges and ab crunches.

In just four months Maisie looked leaner and fitter after going to the gym. She lost her puppy fat and we focused on looking great while on holiday in Florida. It might seem extreme to say to a child but Maisie was starting to prefer how she looked and the exercise was giving her more confidence. Even my son, Leo, then six, would get involved. And even now Im proud of showing my family how to lead a healthy lestyle.   Hayley - who runs her own personal training business called Limitless Personal Training - said while Maisies studies take priority over their gym routine they love going together.

I cant see that they is anything wrong with parents that want to help ensure their kids lead a healthy lestyle. Its impossible for kids not to worry about their appearance in todays world of the internet and TV showing our kids how their bodys should look. We cant shield them from that but we can help educate them on how to improve their lestyles.  I ensure she has porridge for breakfast now and plenty of fruit for snacks. I know plenty of people who say children should be children, butyour child says theyre concerned about their weight and you know they could be more active, then parents should help. Maisie has now grown into an educated young women when it comes to diet and the gym. Embracing a healthy lestyle is something all children and teenagers should do so they go on to be healthy adults.  I have been a personal trainer since Maisie was six and spend the majority of my time educating pre-post natal women and teenagers so theyre healthier both by eating the right things and through regular training.

This was thanks to a team of British troops in Norway who welcomed him to the Arctic Circle with an interesting surprise. Prince Harry , dressed in military unorm, arrived in Bardufoss and was taken to a training base. Once there he met Lance Corporal Lee Lovak and air engineering technician Kevin Burns.The pair sat down with the -year-old inside a small igloo and showed off a shrine they had created for the duke.  Inside the snow-covered shelter there were several mementos especially for Harry - including two photos of himself and Meghan on their wedding day.The igloo also contained several candles and a chair for Harry to sit on. After being offered a seat and taking a look around, the Duke of Sussex couldnt help but have a giggle at the set up. You weirdos, he joked, before thanking them for inviting him into their private shrine.   He also commented on the soft music that was playing in the background: The music, is that part of it  Its Valentines Day, isnt it. Harry went on to praise the work that had gone in to building the shelter. Its quite an accomplishment, once youve finished this, to actually be spending some time here.

But the -year-old isn’t playing truant – he is striking in protest at what he sees as government inaction on climate change. Finlay, his sister Ella, nine, and their friend Megan Ross have braved wind, rain and snow to stand with banners outside Ullashyshypool Primary School in the West Highlands of Scotland to raise awareness of global warming. They were inspired by Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg who protested outside parliament in Stockholm over politicians ignoring the issue. Her stance captured the imagination of young people worldwide, sparking demos from Australia to Canada. And today thousands of pupils across the UK will follow Greta and Finlay’s lead by walking out of school as part of Youth Strike  Climate.   Finlay says: “Politicians aren’t getting the message. I don’t see the point of being educated for one hourhighly educated people aren’t listening to us. What is the point of us planning for our futurethere isn’t going to be one  “I want politicians to listshyshy-en to the scientists. They are the ones who know what to do but they are being ignored because of Brexit . “Our head and my teacher are fully supportive but I don’t think all teachers think it is a good idea.” Pupils from more than  towns and cities including London, Manchester, Lanshyshycaster, Sheffield, Leeds, Camshyshybridge and Truro will join the demonstration, part of a movement sweeping the globe.  North London A-level student Anna Taylor, , is one of the organisers. She says: “I value my education and I am disappointed and angry I am having to miss school but I have no option. We aren’t old enough to vote and it is a matter of letting the Government know that young people care. “We thought we might get  people in London at best. We have been astounded by the response.” Emma Greenwood, , from Ramsbottom, Lancs, is travelling to Manchester to join the protest.   She says: “We need to start taking responsibility for what we are doing to the environment. “My future is in danger and the Government needs to realise that.” The strikes pose a dilemma for heads. Do they support their pupils’ initiative or punish them for skipping lessons  The National Association of Headteachers says: “While a school leader’s role is to ensure children attend school, it is right that inidual leaders can decide how best to respond to any proposed protest.” But Chris McshyshyshyGovern, of the Camshyshypaign for Real Edshyshyshyucation, claims the protests could be hi-jacked by “environmental Pied Pipers”.  He says: “Greta’s stand has started a bandwagon and extremists are now climbing on board. “The kids are being led by the tune of environmental pied pipers. They will be driven from the protest in polluting cars munching burgshyshyers made of methane-emitting cattle and chatting on phones built from extremely rare minerals. “For many it will just be the chance to bunk off and have a laugh.” But Finlay’s dad, fisheries officer Jeff, , is supshyshyportive. He says: “People of my genshyshyeration have had our opshyshyshyportunity to do something and we failed miserably. “So I don’t think we should be too surprisedyoung people of the world decide it is up to them to get it sorted.” Pupils demands The UK Student Climate Network have put together a list of four demands: . That the Government declares a climate emergency and prioritises the protection of le on Earth. . Reforms to the national curriculum to address the ecological crisis as an educational priority. . That the Government informs the public about the need to act on climate change. . And that the Government recognises that young people have the biggest stake in our future by lowering the voting age to .

Being on the pitch it certainly felt it could have been a lot more than - at the break.“We dominated the game and that gives you a bit of confidence, especially playing against a Premiership team.“Second half we knew St Mirren were going to come out and have a bit more about them.“They did, but we were dealing with it without any real problems.“Unfortunately for us, Calum Butcher got sent off when it was a - tackle in midfield and could have just been a yellow card.“But he got sent off and then we showed the character to stick in and win the game.“We were playing against a team from the level above us for about  minutes with  men. We rolled our sleeves up and got the result we deserved.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c618efadbfbd5.08419022.jpg ","title":"far travelled dundee star ryan mcgowan says scots footballers are luckier than they think","story":"Far-travelled Ryan McGowan believes Scottish footballers don’t realise how lucky they are as they make their way in the game without having to give up their home comforts.When the -year-old signed for Dundee on loan from Bradford City at the end of last month, it took his tally of clubs in a -year senior career to .And having turned out for outfits in his native Australia, Scotland, China, the United Arab Emirates and England during that period, he’s clocked up more air miles that your average long-haul airline pilot.Having always known he’d have to travel round the world to make a career in football, the Socceroo believes it’s made him more open to hop from one country to another.That, he’s learned, is in contrast to many of the friends he’s made here in Scotland.“Scottish kids probably don’t realise how lucky they are. They’ve got something like  full-time clubs within a three-hour drive of where they’ve grown up,” he said.“When I was growing up in Adelaide, we had one team and then it was a two-hour flight to the next closest.“Soyou weren’t good enough for that team, you had to work harder and be prepared to sht around.“I know boys here who only want to play for teams in or near Edinburgh – and they can.“Scottish boys are very lucky to have so many clubs and opportunities without having to move.”While he’s no regrets about his nomadic career, McGowan admits the chance to hang around in one place for a prolonged period is growing more attractive.Particularlythat place is here in Scotland, the country he regards as his adopted home.“I do sometimes think I’d love to sign a two or three-year contract somewhere again,” he added.“I would have probably have loved to have stayed on at Hearts for a couple of more seasons and I was enjoying my time at United when I was there but bids came in and were accepted.“And having an Australian passport does open doors in Asia, which is why I’ve ended up there a few times.”If the chance arises to stay at Dundee long-term, he admits it’s something he will give serious thought.He has not, and will not, look that far ahead until he’s helped the Dark Blues out of their current predicament.“A couple of weeks ago moving to Dundee hadn’t even come onto my horizon. Everything has happened quickly and I just want to make sure that, first and foremost, we stay in this league.“When the summer comes,an opportunity arises to stay I will definitely consider it but there is a lot of work to be done between now and then.”He is confident by the end of the season Dundee will be safe.“It’s been really good so far. They are a great bunch of boys and they have made me feel really welcome in the dressing-room.“I’ve kicked most of them when I was playing here in seasons gone by so I know most of them.“There’s a good manager in Jim McIntyre to work under as well. I’m showing my age here but I’ve actually played against him when I was a young player on loan at Ayr from Hearts.“He was coming to the end of his career then and later I played against a couple of his teams once he’d become a manager.“I’m quite close with a couple of players who have played under him and they spoke highly of him and that was more of a factor in coming here.“Having played across the road I also knew how big a club Dundee is. It’s a good club, in a dficult position at the minute but definitely one we can get out of.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c62a1edba50c1.56795146.jpg ","title":"george cran dundee are in a far better place now than when jim mcintyre arrived","story":"Almost four months into his reign as Dundee manager, Jim McIntyre won’t look back on his first match in charge with too much fondness.However, he might just do so with a great deal more satisfaction with how his squad has shaped up in the time since.Despite only picking up two wins and six draws in the  matches under McIntyre, there’s a growing sense of optimism at Dens Park after some encouraging displays since the January transfer window.The opposite can be said of Saturday’s opponents Livingston, the side the Dark Blues faced in Jim’s debut in the dugout.After a lightning-fast start to theirto the Premiership – which peaked with that - thumping of Dundee back in October – Livi’s form has slipped off a clf with last Wednesday’s - draw at Hearts bringing a five-game losing streak to an end.Since leaving Dundee gaffer Jim in no doubt how big a job he had on his hands with that - success at the Tony Macaroni Arena, Gary Holt’s side have only picked up three victories and none since the middle of December.That’s seen them slip from a high of second spot with  points from their first eight games down to ninth with just  picked up from the following  matches.And, though the gap between the sides hasn’t shrunk in those four months, the feeling around both clubs right now couldn’t be more dferent.A massive part of that from Dundee’s point of view is the complete overhaul of the playing squad in the winter transfer window.In fact, there’s a fair chance there won’t be any of the players who featured in the - defeat the last time the Dark Blues travelled to West Lothian this time around.Only three of the  used by Jim that day remain at the club – Elliott Parish, Cammy Kerr and Kenny Miller.Of those, only Miller looks like he could be given a start this time around but even he has a fair bit of competition to overcome with Andrew Nelson on the goal trail and Craig Curran preferred by the manager to lead the line in every match since he arrived at the club at the start of January.A missed penalty in stoppage time in their last run-out won’t have helped veteran Miller’s cause either.Meanwhile, Parish hasn’t featured since that - thumping and doesn’t look like dislodging Seny Dieng as first choice any time soon.The nature of the goals that day, with all four from set-pieces, no doubt led the manager to question his defenders.Parish quickly paid the price by dropping to the bench while three of the back four have been moved on.Andy Boyle is now at Ross County, Ryan Inniss was sent back to Crystal Palace after a nightmare at Palmerston in the Scottish Cup and Calvin Miller has also dropped to the Championship, being picked up by Ayr United on loan from Celtic.Kerr was right-back in October but he’s seen his place taken by new signing James Horsfield in recent games.The former Manchester City kid has looked assured in Kerr’s place and will take some shting before Saturday.The rest of the team have since been shown the exit door – Glen Kamara, Kharl Madianga, Lewis Spence, Sofien Moussa, Benjy Kallman, Roarie Deacon and Adil Nabi have all moved on.Even the side that drew - with Livi at Dens on Boxing Day will be unrecognisable to the one running out this weekend.Whatever side he opts for, Jim knows his team are in a far better place than when he took over – now they have to prove that by getting points on the board."},{"url":null,"title":"ruthless dundee united hammer dundee 7 0 in wee derby","story":"A very strong Dundee United reserves were ruthless at Dens Park as they dispatched a youthful Dundee -

to Robbie Neilson’s Championship outfit.Referee Willie Collum was just yards away from the collision and only deemed the offence worthy of a yellow card.Even though the foul was seen by the referee, under SFA rules compliance officer Clare Whyte could have issued a notice of complaint to the former Dundee full-back had she decided the incident was “exceptional in nature”.A  of three former referees would also have to have given their unanimous agreement McGinn deserved to be sent off for Whyte to proceed with a notice of complaint but it has been decided there was not enough evidence."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c640bc2771117.02764497.jpg ","title":"tom duthie this time the renewed hope at dundee united might not be a false dawn","story":"For the first time in a long time, perhaps even since the dark days of relegation in , there is strong reason for optimism at Dundee United.The one thing that should be stressed about that immediately is it’s still early days.Robbie Neilson’s rebuilt team is only two games in and that means there is some way to go before we can confirm things are definitely on the up at Tannadice.And the truth is that will only come with promotion back to the Premiership.It must also be said there have been other  dawns over the past three years.The arrival of Ray McKinnon and then Csaba Laslo as managers brought hope and even early promise that, after the disastrous   campaign, things were being turned around.In fairness to McKinnon in particular, had he been handed the kind of budget that was made available to the current team boss in the January transfer window, the major problems at the club might well have been sorted and the Tangerines could have been back in the top flight already.Unfortunately for him, those in the boardroom when he was in charge were unable to provide the kind of cash for signings new American owner Mark Ogren has.That, incidentally, is not a criticism of the previous regimes, just an unfortunate fact.Neilson has been lucky he’s got an owner with dollars to spend and the indications so far suggest that owner is just as fortunate that he has a manager who knows how to spend it wisely.Ogren can also consider himself blessed his predecessor in the chairman’s seat at Tannadice, Mike Martin, found not just a good manager, but one who through being out of the game for a period, had taken the time to look at United and form a clear picture of what was needed.Because one thing that’s obvious about the signings made is all have been part of a jigsaw in the manager’s mind.January  didn’t just come round and see Neilson turn his thoughts to what was available. He’d done his homework and, equally importantly, worked out exactly where his squad needed strengthening.That means the right players for the right positions have been found, or so it seems.That’s produced victories over Morton and St Mirren that have lted spirits among Arabs. Rightly so, because both outings have seen impressive work.Of course, with most of those brought in lacking match fitness – that’s usually the major issue with January signings – the good football, has mostly come in the first hour.Players who’ve not had a lot of game time have tired, particularly when reduced to  men at St Mirren. They’ve then shown their ability to manage matches.What the manager also looks to have done well is identy those already in his squad who were good enough to be part of his plans.For all new boys like Peter Pawlett, Mark Reynolds and Mark Connolly have deserved the praise they’ve received for their first couple of performances, attackers Pavol Safranko and Nicky Clark have shown they remain big players.After a run of just two goals in nine games, Safranko has found his scoring touch with one in each of the last two outings and has looked the lethal striker he did when he first arrived on loan from Aalborg.Now he’s finally got fully fit, Clark also looks dangerous and there’s no doubt both have benefited from having better players round them in the last two outings.For Neilson and his players the trick is now to keep the good work going.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

The bunds will help reduce the risk of debris reaching the A in the event of a landslide.This project allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of recycling the material being excavated from the Rest and Be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works.To keep roadworkers and motorists safe throughout the works, temporary traffic lights will be in place on the A at each location. This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire health board 22m debt","story":"NewsAyrshire health board £m debt fearNHS Ayrshire  Arran have slashed the amount spent on agency nurses and made other cutbacks but the shortfall is still soaring.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  FEB NewsBoard Chair Martin Cheyne \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyrshire’s health board is on the verge of racking up a poundmillion debt this year.

The board had already overspent by pound.m up to the end of December. The debt could soar to pound.m by the end of March.

Nursing agency spend has been pared down to poundm for the current financial year. The report said: “ Whilst it may not be possible to completely eradicate the use of agency nurses, a further poundm reduction is on target to be achieved in  .” There has been a dramatic reduction over the last three years with costs paid on external nursing staff droppng by half.

Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

His death revealed he had left his entire fortune in his will to his native town of Troon. His legacy would provide education awards and grants for the people of the town along with a new public school. As Marr’s train travelled north he decided to break his journey, to pay a visit to his sister in Girvan. He was close to his sister Helen and visited her often after her marriage to ColonelABGrant, owner of Killochan Castle estate at Girvan, who was also a senior partner in the firm of Grant Somerville  Co in London and was later ordained as Revd. Grant in the Church of Scotland. Marr had intended to spend part of his fortnight at Girvan but extended his stay to a month. Perhaps his change of heart was due to the widespread unrest taking place in Glasgow at that time. The January of  saw the so-called ‘Harbour Riots’, where racial confrontations were breaking out between black and white merchant seamen on the town’s quayside and spreading into the town. A four day General Strike was called for on January  and four days later George Square was crammed with tens of thousands of angry workmen. Crowds of unemployed men joined in the fracas for a  hour working week. As tempers flared the army was deployed, troops brought in tanks and armored vehicles to control the crowds. As tensions heightened it was not an environment travellers would want to find themselves caught up in. Eventually CK Marr left Girvan on Saturday February  for his onward journey north to his annual shooting and fishing break in Perthshire. As the train made its way towards the city he took ill with acute appendicitis. When taken off the train at the Central Station he was rushed to the Glasgow Nursing Home, but it was already too late as he tragically died in the operating theatre. There is little known of Charles Kerr Marr, despite having a successful career in the coal exporting business. Born on October , , at  Welbeck Crescent, Troon, he was the third son of Captain John Marr, master of the merchant ship ‘Reciprocity’, sailing between Troon and Canada. John Marr and his we Amelia had five children, sons William, John and Charles, along with two daughters, Helen and Amelia. Up to the age of ten, Charles attended the Parish School in Academy Street at Troon, going on to join his two brothers at Irvine Royal Academy to complete his education. On finishing his schooling, Marr was apprenticed at A  J Guthrie, Coal Agents at Troon Harbour. Unlike his brother John, who followed in his father’s footsteps to become a sea captain, Marr left home as soon as his apprenticeship ended, to work as a Commercial Clerk with Kitstons, Iron Merchants in Glasgow. Moving later to take up the position of cashier at Clyde Ironworks, only to leave a short time later to be manager of the firm of GrantSomerville  Co in London. The move may have been influenced by A B Grant, who was a senior partner in the company and married to his sister Helen. By the time he met his future we, some years later, there is no evidence as to when he moved back to Glasgow, or indeed any explanation found as to his change of occupation. Marr is recorded in the Scotland census of  as residing in Renfrew Street in Glasgow and again on his marriage certicate a year later, where he is also recorded as being employed as a Soft Goods Warehouseman.  Little is known as to why he left coal exporting to go into the Drapery business, or where he met and fell in love with his we Agnes Murray Kinghorn. However, Agnes’s father was a General Merchant, so it would seem likely he met her in his line of work. Charles and Agnes married on March ,  and set up home at Sutherland Terrace in Glasgow’s Hillhead. Unfortunately, after only  months of married le, Agnes tragically died of Phthisis Pulmonalis . She was just  years of age. Her death was a severe blow to Marr, leaving him brokenhearted and distraught, which had a profound effect on him. Shortly after he laid his we to rest, he had thought of going abroad to work, but instead accepted an appointment with Hull Blyth  Company of London. Within a year he was made a partner in the company when he developed the firm’s export trade. His work of establishing depots in numerous ports in the world gave him an opportunity to travel abroad, especially to China and Japan, where he found an interest in collecting oriental treasures. During his time with Hull Blyth the firm went on to become one of the largest shipping charterers in the UK. Charles Kerr Marr played a signicant part in the company’s worldwide success. Charles Marr moved to London after his we’s death, he never again owned a house. All his years in London, he alternated between two clubs, the Athenaeum and the Constitutional. The nearest he came to having a home was in his later years, when he rented two rooms in Camden House at Chislehurst in Kent, which was originally built for Napoleon the rd. Just being there helped him to relax and take up golf. He was reputed to be good company with a great sense of humour and well known to be very generous. Marr was a lover of the arts and music and in all that time he rarely spoke of his we, or of her death and he never remarried, even his closest friends assumed he was a bachelor. When he retired in  he spent a good part of each year fishing and shooting in Scotland. Two years before his untimely death, Charles Marr carefully drafted out his will in , leaving his entire fortune to the people of Troon and setting out the way it was to be carried out. Marr’s coal fortune legacy has given the town a magnicent architectural school building with playing fields the envy of the country. Marr College on its own is a fitting tribute to this man of extraordinary vision. By the time Marr College opened in  the school had attracted the most renowned academics to come and teach. It was the only grant aided school in Scotland that didn’t charge fees. A public school for every child of the town, had oak led class rooms, inlaid parquet flooring, Italian tiled corridorsa copper domed library, purple velvet drapes and teachers attired in flowing cloaks with mortar boards on their heads, this was seen by all to be a stunning,not magnicent, comprehensive school, deemed to be the best school in Scotland and envied by it. The CK Marr Educational Trust, the only one of its kind in Scotland, has provided awards or grants to hundreds of Troon students, of all ages each year. The addition of the MarrEducation Resource Centre in Troon Library, the only one then in Ayrshire, is a valuable educational resource for all who use it. Marr College and the CK Marr Educational Trust are a testimony to the wishes of Charles Kerr Marr and a fitting memorial to this great benefactor. He was buried beside his beloved we in CathcartCemetery in Glasgow. Over the past century the people of Troon owe a huge debt to custodians of Marr’s vision, the Marr Trustees, past and present. Over the decades the many Trustees, Boards of Governors and ious Clerks, Treasurers and Accountants, who have and still do today and for many decades to come, have successfully upheld the wishes of the town’s greatest ever benefactor and extraordinary visionary, Charles Kerr Marr.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandUniversities and CollegesGlasgowEducationFishingArmed forcesLove and romanceSchoolsRenfrewTroonPerthshireGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema set return prestwick after","story":"NewsCinema set forto Prestwick after  year gapReturn to the golden age of screen in PrestwickShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB NewsFriends of Broadway - they want cinema open again \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCinema made a boldto Prestwick for the first time in more than  years.

Licensing bosses at East Ayrshire Council knocked back the flurry of applications for early morning drinking before the January  showdown. Despite the historic nature of the sporting event, the department decided to maintain their stance on trying to clamp down on excess boozing during football. The East Ayrshire Licensing board depute clerk Stuart McCall told councillors it was important to maintain the standard policy and have consistency. He pointed to Celtic and Rangers matches as examples of tense clashes requiring robust licensing rules. Mr McCall said: “The standard practice is games start early and the reason for that is to limit the amount of alcohol supporters can have.” “We all know the outcome excess alcohol can have in certain circumstances.” Congragulating Talbot, he added: “We are all delighted to see the result. “The maintenance of the policy is important so we are not accused of favouritism.” Some venues wanted to offer breakfast to supporters.

John, , said: “All I want is the best for Cumnock and we are so fortunte to have so many things going on now. “I just want to make it better than it is.” The Keir McTurk Memorial Committee chose John after “much deliberation” from all the nominations.

in Somerset, but the number at Creswell Crags is far higher ndash with hundreds in one cave alone and marks now found in all the caves at the site.There may even have been more in the past, as the caves were excavated by archaeologists during the th century and were widened in the process, potentially accounting for some surfaces featuring no marks.It is the latest signicant discovery at the caves, whichprovided shelter for Neanderthal and anatomically modern people through a crucial period of human evolution between , and , years ago.The site has been a rich source of archaeological finds and even features Britainrsquos earliest cave art, with ,-year-old pictures of birds, deer, bison and horses.\"Whole walls of the caves are covered in the protective marks John Charlesworth, heritage facilitator and the tour leader at the time of the discovery of the protective marks, said: ldquoThese witchesrsquo marks were in plain sight all the time.ldquoBeing present at the moment their true signicance was revealed will stay with me forever.This remarkable place continues to give up its secrets.Academic and TV presenter Professor Ronald Hutton, an authority on folklore, said:ldquoThis discovery is signicant because it looks like the largest assemblage of protective marks ever found in British caves, and possibly anywhere in Britain.ldquoThis is a suddenly a large new area of research for historians and archaeologists, and so adds appreciatively to the importance of the Crags as a world resource.The team who look after Creswell Crags are now working with academics and experts from Historic England to better understand the signicance and extent of the discovery at the site, which is a scheduled monument.Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: ldquoCreswell Crags is already of international importance for its Ice Age art and ancient remains.ldquoTo find this huge number of protection marks from the more recent past adds a whole new layer of discovery.ldquoEven  years ago, the English countryside was a very dferent place death and disease were everyday companions and evil forces could readily be imagined in the dark.ldquoWe can only speculate on what it was the people of Creswell feared might emerge from the underworld into these caves.Creswell Crags will be launching tours of the areas containing witchesrsquo marks for the first time, from late February..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: UK us largest collection of witches u marks discovered in caves"},{"url":null,"title":"mountain biker

larger Saab  or equivalent aircraft that can land in more adverse weather conditions # we understand the economies of scale and suggest a service that can fly to Campbeltown and then on to Islay, back to Campbeltown and ing to Glasgow, or vice versa.We would like the reinstatement of the radar system to assist landings in adverse weather conditions.As there is a separate service between Islay and Edinburgh we suggest that Campbeltown should be included as we also have key tourist attractions such as distilleries and three fantastic -hole golf courses and high-standard accommodation.We would like to see the service continue with a timetable with low ticket prices to allow the full day in Glasgow for NHS appointments, business and shopping trips and the reinstatement of seven days a week flights to enhance business and tourism.In addition, we want national advertising campaigns inclusive of timetables to promote the area for increased passenger numbers, including weekend breaks.These

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, is thought to be the largest collection of its kind in one place in the UK.The discovery was made byenthusiasts Hayley Clark and Ed Waters, from the Subterranea Britannica group, during a cave tour when they noticed the rare protection marks on the walls.The marks were previously thought to have been graffiti from the time before the caves were shut off.Witchesrsquo marks, orldquoapotropaic marks, from the Greek word apotrepein, ldquoto turn away, are most commonly found in historic churches and houses,near doorways, windows and fireplaces, to protect the inhabitants from evil spirits.Experts said the number and iety of the marks found in the caves is unprecedented.Among the most common are the double VV engravings, thought to reference Mary, Virgin of Virgins, and PM or Pace Maria, while other symbols are believed to be devices for capturing or trapping evil, including diagonal lines, boxes and mazes.The marks appear to have been added to over time and may indicate a need to strengthen the protection against underworld spirits in response to unexpected sickness, death or poor crops, the experts said.Until now the largest known quantity of witchesrsquo marks in caves in Britain was  in Somerset, but the number at Creswell Crags is far higher ndash with hundreds in one cave alone and marks now found in all the caves at the site.There may even have been more in the past, as the caves were excavated by archaeologists during the th century and were widened in the process, potentially accounting for some surfaces featuring no marks.It is the latest signicant discovery at the caves, whichprovided shelter for Neanderthal and anatomically modern people through a crucial period of human evolution between , and , years ago.The site has been a rich source of archaeological finds and even features Britainrsquos earliest cave art, with ,-year-old pictures of birds, deer, bison and horses.John Charlesworth, heritage facilitator and the tour leader at the time of the discovery of the protective marks, said: ldquoThese witchesrsquo marks were in plain sight all the time.ldquoBeing present at the moment their true signicance was revealed will stay with me forever.This remarkable place continues to give up its secrets.Academic and TV presenter Professor Ronald Hutton, an authority on folklore, said:ldquoThis discovery is signicant because it looks like the largest assemblage of protective marks ever found in British caves, and possibly anywhere in Britain.ldquoThis is a suddenly a large new area of research for historians and archaeologists, and so adds appreciatively to the importance of the Crags as a world resource.The team who look after Creswell Crags are now working with academics and experts from Historic England to better understand the signicance and extent of the discovery at the site, which is a scheduled monument.Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: ldquoCreswell Crags is already of international importance for its Ice Age art and ancient remains.ldquoTo find this huge number of protection marks from the more recent past adds a whole new layer of discovery.ldquoEven  years ago, the English countryside was a very dferent place death and disease were everyday companions and evil forces could readily be imagined in the dark.ldquoWe can only speculate on what it was the people of Creswell feared might emerge from the underworld into these caves.Creswell Crags will be launching tours of the areas containing witchesrsquo marks for the first time, from late February."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource

He effectively dropped his opposition to her Withdrawal Agreement, which Labour had repeatedly condemned as the ldquoworst of all worlds. The Labour leaderrsquos letter still calls for a customs union, regulatory alignment on trade and guarantees on workers rights and security cooperation. But, crucially, Labour is no longer holding to the ldquosix tests, and insisting a Brexit deal should deliver ldquoexactly the same benefits as being in the single market.Labour has even dropped its opposition to the Irish backstop, which Mr Corbyn condemned, as recently as December, for leaving Britain ldquoin an indefinite halfway house with no say on its future. The explanatory note that Labour circulated after the leaderrsquos letter to May is quite clear. ldquoAny withdrawal agreement,\" it says, ldquowill need to include a backstop.\" Labour is also hinting at further compromises in ldquonegotiations.Hitherto, Labourrsquos policy has been to make demands May could never accept now they are trying to make her an offer she canrsquot refuse.So at last, after months of there being nothing much new to say about Brexit, suddenly we have what looks like a breakthrough, a historic compromise. Of course, you canrsquot overestimate the ability of political leaders to look a gt horse in the mouth. Theresa May may be so wedded to being a ldquobloody dficult womanthat she may find a way to avoid accepting Labourrsquos free hooved mammal. But the deal is there to be made.Senior Tories like Sir Oliver Letwin have welcomed the Labour offer, seeing it as a step towards a Norway-style agreement, even though it isnrsquot. Labourrsquos plan is much closer to Turkey, which is also in a customs union and accepts regulatory alignment. Brussels likes Corbyns proposals too, as a way out of hard Brexit ldquohell.Ive argued that the logic of Labourrsquos position was always to back something resembling Theresa Mayrsquos deal with the EU. It corresponds to Labourrsquos manesto commitments to leaving the EU, including the single market, and ending free movement while seeking frictionless trade. Mrs May has always supported regulatory alignment, since the ldquocommon rule book in her Chequers plan. And the backstop, remember, involves the UK remaining in the customs union until there is a future comprehensive trade deal.In what could almost have been a coordinated intervention last week, Mrs May restated in Dublin her determination to prevent a hard border in Ireland. This put the wind up the DUP, since they fear that the border might now move to the Irish Sea.It didnrsquot appeal to the hardline Brexiteers in her own party either, who are adamant that no deal is better than her bad deal. They thought it had been killed off by last monthrsquos record-breaking Commons defeat ndash but it may now live again with Labourrsquos backing.They canrsquot admit it, of course, but May and Corbyn are now speaking broadly the same language. The customs union, regulatory alignment, rights and protections etc are all matters to do with the future trade relationship with the EU, not the Withdrawal Agreement. It covers only money, citizenship and the Good Friday Agreement.The trading relationship can only be negotiated after Brexit. It is to be hammered out within the up to four years of the transition period, during which the UK remains in the single market and the customs union.Onlythere is no agreement does the backstop comes into play, and that really just extends the transition period indefinitely. May has said she will get assurances that the backstop will be time-limited, but she canrsquot get that from the European Union. If it was limited, it would no longer be a backstop.What hard Brexiteers really fear is that the transition period might lead to a soft Brexit, not a clean break ndash and they are right. What we know is that MPs will block any no-deal Brexit. Hardliners face a choice of May Corbyn or no Brexit at all.To secure a Commons majority without them, Mrs May could promise legislation to keep Britain in regulatory alignment with the customs union until a new trade deal is finalised ndash one which delivers the same benefits. This is anyway implicit in her promises to keep trade ldquofrictionless. Indeed, remaining in a customs union is the only way of achieving this. Up to now, she hasnrsquot been able to say this openly for fear of a rebellion by her hardline backbenchers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg. They want a managed no-deal now, or in four years, under the so-called ldquoMalthouse Plan.Butshe has an ounce of political sense, May will now face them down and pivot to Labourrsquos softish Brexit. Labourrsquos demand that she put the customs union in primary legislation can be finessed, because the trade negotiations canrsquot happen until after Brexit. She doesnrsquot even need to ensure that Labour votes with her. Labour could abstain in the meaningful vote and achieve essentially the same result. The DUP would accept the customs union as a guarantee against a backstop or an east west hard border.Jeremy Corbyn could explain Labourrsquos abstention, which will be attacked by Vote Leave MPs andleader writers, by saying, as his spokespeople did last week: that the top priority ldquofor the nation is to avoid a no-deal. Corbynite commentators can be relied upon to condemn any Labour MPs who continue to vote against Mayrsquos deal as traitors. Unreconstructed Blairites, voting with the hated Moggists to force a no-deal disaster.Corbynrsquos letter made no reference to a Peoples Vote. Remainers in the Labour Party realise where all this is heading, which is why a number, like former shadow cabinet figures like Owen Smith, and Clive Lewis, have threatened to leave the party. That could become part of the script.Corbyn has used the Brexit issue to smoke out Blairite Remainers like Chuka Umunna, and the Jewish MP, Luciana Berger, in order to portray them as disloyal splitters.Of course, ordinary members of the Labour Party will be mightily confused. Many of them still think Labour is committed to a referendum. It still could come to that, of course,May doesnrsquot seize this opportunity.I still harbour vague hopes that A could be revoked, but Irsquom afraid that pro-Europeans are on the wrong side of history right now. The country is destined to leave the EU, because letrsquos face it, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is and has always been a pro-Brexit party.And after Brexit Day  Well, get ready for Groundhog Day  as negotiations over the future EU trade deal begin all over again."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-nicola-sturgeon-announces-no-deal-information-campaigns","story":"Appearing on ITVrsquos Peston programme later tonight, the First Minister in a pre-recorded interview spoke out following a meeting of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Resilience Committee.Noting how the body was more used to dealing with bad weather or the impact of terrorist attacks, she said: ldquoWersquove been focusing today on how we cope with the implications of no-deal and, frankly, that discussion is deeply depressing and very frustrating because itrsquos not inevitable and we shouldnrsquot have to be doing it.ldquoTo be sitting in peacetime in a prosperous country talking about the possibility of food shortages and medicine shortages is frankly incredible, declared Ms Sturgeon.She went on: ldquoItrsquos not inevitable. The Government at UK level should take that prospect off the table, it should rule out no-deal and its failure to do so with every day that passes right now becomes increasingly reckless and negligent.But, she explained, such a prospect did put a responsibility on the Scottish Government to increase its planning.ldquoWe stepped up the level of our planning today, the FM revealed.ldquoWe canrsquot mitigate all impacts of that, the impacts will be so wide-ranging and so severe that it will not be possible to take away all of that impact but itrsquos important that within our areas of responsibility wersquore doing everything that we possibly can and wersquore very focused on exactly that.Asked what advice she would be giving to Scottish householders, Ms Sturgeon replied: ldquoThe Scottish Government over the next few weeks will run public information campaigns.ldquoWersquoll look to give not just advice to households but we will give advice, we already give advice to businesses and to all sectors of the economy.ldquoOf course therersquos a balance we need to strike. We donrsquot want to unnecessarily worry and scare people but with every day that passes itrsquos more important that the implications are understood and that the Scottish Government working with our partners, local government, the business community and others, that we take all possible steps.When it was put to her that Theresa May did not have the power to take no-deal off the table and she might have to ask the EU for an extension to the Article  process, which they could refuse, the SNP leader replied: ldquoOkay, I accept that point but she should request it and the SNP amendment that will be tabled for tomorrow makes that call on the UK Government to request an extension.ldquoIt is based on what I hear from Europe. It is unlikely that that would be turned down by the European Union of course, it is more likely to be acceptedthat request comes with a clear plan to take a dferent approach.ldquoItrsquos not going to help in the medium to long terman extension is simply to continue this unseemly argument that the House of Commons is engaged in right now because they canrsquot agree what they want to do, she added."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-faces-valentines-day-commons-humiliation-as-tory-brexiteers-poised-to-defeat-government-motion","story":"Such a move would further hamper the Prime Ministerrsquos efforts to get the EU to agree a revised deal as the clock runs down to exit day on March .As MPs prepared for the latest Commons showdown, Nicola Sturgeon hit out at the ldquofrankly incredible consequences of a no-deal outcome, including shortages of food and medicine.In an interview with ITVrsquos Peston programme, following a meeting of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Resilience Committee, the First Minister insisted a no-deal Brexit was not inevitable.ldquoThe Government at UK level should take that prospect off the table, it should rule out no-deal and its failure to do so with every day that passes right now becomes increasingly reckless and negligent, she declared.In the second next-steps Commons debate and vote today, the Government has put forward a seemingly innocuous motion, reiterating Parliamentrsquos support for the ldquoapproach to leaving the EU expressed by this House on January .:Brexit: Theresa May accused of showing contempt for democracyLast monthrsquos votes not only saw an amendment passed that called for the backstop to be replaced by ldquoalternative arrangements, which the Government championed, but also one rejecting the UK leaving the EU without a deal.On Tuesday night, Olly Robbins, the UKrsquos chief Brexit official, was reportedly overheard in a Brussels bar, saying Mrs Mayrsquos strategy was to offer a last-minute Commons vote in March for either her revised deal or a y delay to Brexit.During PMQs, she brushed aside the claim, saying people should not rely ldquoon what someone said to someone  as overheard by someone  in a bar, again emphasising the Article  timescale ran out on March .No  sought to disabuse people of the notion Mrs May was surreptitiously ruling out a no-deal outcome.Her spokesman declared: ldquoIf yoursquore asking me a question: does no-deal remain on the table  The answer is yes.But members of the Conservativesrsquo anti-EU European Research Council made clear they could not support the ldquoclumsily-worded Government motion.Mark Francois, its vice-chairman, said: ldquoWe cannot vote for this as it is currently configured because it rules out no-deal and removes our negotiating leverage in BrusselshellipIt is madness.Several amendments have been tabled. John Bercow, the Speaker, will decide which ones will be debated and voted on this evening.Labour has tabled a proposal, which would require the Government to either put its deal to a vote by February  or allow Parliament to take control of the process.Its Shadow Brexit Secretary, Keir Starmer - who on Wednesday had \"frank and serious\" talks with David Lidington, the PMrsquos de facto deputy - said Labour was committed to preventing Mrs May from pursuing a \"reckless\" policy of running down the clock so MPs were faced with a choice between her deal or no-deal with just days to go to exit day.The SNP tabled an amendment requiring the UK Government to begin immediate negotiations with the European Council to extend Article  by no less than three months.:Ian Blackford accuses Theresa May of rewriting the history books over BrexitIan Blackford, the party leader at Westminster, said: ldquoThe UK Government must stop running down the clock and put the brakes on Brexit before we are dragged off the clf-edge with catastrophic damage to jobs, living standards and the economy.Other amendments include one tabled by Ken Clarke, the former Tory Chancellor, calling for votes on ious Brexit options and one from the SNPrsquos Angus MacNeil to scrap the Article  process altogether.While todayrsquos vote will be an important indicator of Parliamentrsquos mood, any successful amendment will not be legally binding on the Government.In contrast, a promised next-steps vote on February  is being described as ldquoHigh Noon as it is when a new amendment, drawn up by Labourrsquos Yvette Cooper, will be tabled, stipulatingthere were no deal by mid-March, MPs would either vote to agree a no-deal Brexit or to require the PM to seek an extension of Article .A similar move was defeated in January but the new version appears to be gaining more support and could even be backed by Cabinet ministers, who would resign to do so.

In doing so it seeks a prospectus that can uny a settled will behind Scotlandrsquos next step along our lsquojourney without endrsquo.:Alex Salmond takes swipe at SNP leadership over IndyrefMr Wilson said ldquoall of would love Rome to be built in a day, but the lesson of Brexit was that ldquohonesty, candour and realistic vision was the most likely to succeed.On currency, he said an independent Scotland would start bny keeping the pound, and only move to its own currency and Central Banksix key economic tests were passed.ldquoThis question could be re-examined every year in a report to Parliament, he said.In simple terms, passing the tests means it will be in the interests of our economy, trade, government and public finances and therefore services, citizens, jobs and employers to create a new Scottish currency.Tory MSP Adam Tomkins said:\"The Nationalists are desperate for independence and they will do or say anything to get it.First their ill-fated White Paper was rejected by the people in the  referendum.ldquoThen Mr Wilsonrsquos growth commission blueprint for an austerity independence was rejected by his own SNP.Now theyrsquore onto their third attempt to woo voters by pretending that independence is not really independence at all.ldquoHospitals are in crisis, teachers are contemplating unprecedented strike action and roads are crumbling - the SNP has many more pressing matters to be focusing on than independence, whatever it is that means this week.LibDem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said: \"With Brexit, the SNP have spent two years setting out the arguments against themselves.ldquoThey have slowly come round to the idea of a peoplersquos vote as it dawned on them that having close ties with our neighbours is a good thing and severing old unions is a tough and fruitless task.ldquoAndrew Wilson is advocating a soft-independence and a slow transition. Having written the Growth Commission report himself, he knows being out on our own will mean less money in the public purse and poorer public services.\"Thatrsquos not good for anyone in Scotland.Labour MSPJames Kelly added:\"The author of the so-called Growth Commission can try and rebrand leaving the UK however he likes, but in reality his plans mean another decade of austerity for Scotland and an economic model that works for bigbusiness, not workers.\"Pamela Nash, chief executive of the pro-UK Scotland in Uniongroup, said:ldquoThere is no such thing as soft independence.ldquoIndependence would involve breaking up the most successful union the world has ever seen, building barriers between families, friends and neighbours.ldquoIt would ide our home market, jeopardising our economy, and lead to further and deeper austerity.ldquoWith the SNPrsquos proposal to rejoin the EU, an independent Scotland would have to sign up to the euro and there is the very real possibility of a hard border with the rest of the UK.ldquoVoters wonrsquot be fooled by this ndash the majority of people in Scotland know we are better off together and want Scotland to remain part of the UK, building a shared future based on economic prosperity.Separately, SNP ministers have been criticised for repeatedly refusing to say whether they have taken legal advice on holding a wildcat Catalan-style referendum on independence.The Scottish LibDems accused the government of ldquostonewalling on the issue after the top law officer refused to say whether he had been consulted on the matter.Responding to a request for details from MSP Mike Rumbles, the Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC said ldquoconvention meant it was inappropriate for him to comment.ldquoIt is however open to you to ask the Scottish Government what its position is, he said.But Mr Rumbles said he had already been given the brush-off by ministers.Theresa May has refused to grant Holyrood a so-called Section  order empowering it to hold another legally watertight referendum, leading to speculation about a wildcat vote, such as the one held in Catalonia in defiance of the Spanish government.Ms Sturgeon has also always said a Section  referendum, of the kind held in , is the gold standard, and has show no appetite for a Catalan-style vote.However Mr Rumbles said: ldquoThe Scottish Government are going to outrageous s to avoid telling the public what they are plotting behind closed doors. Ministers just shuffle excuses back and forward between themselves. Itrsquos not good enough.ldquoPeople have a right to know what their government is up to. Rather than stonewalling, government ministers mustto Parliament to confirm whether they are actively considering a wildcat independence referendum without a section  order."},{"url":null,"title":"noel-gallagher-announces-intimate-scottish-gig","story":"The -year-old will open his tour at the Edinburgh Playhouse on May , before heading toLlandudno, London and Hull.He teased that new material is being recorded at the moment, and could get an airing at the shows.Just announced: NGHFBrsquos will play a UK run of intimate, seated shows in May, calling in at Edinburgh, Llandudno, Hull and London Palladium.*SPOILER ALERT* New material, currently being recorded, could get an airinghellipTix: Mon th Feb, am GMT ## https:t.co pUBfJiq pic lSNUIddIAThe series of UK gigs comes before the band is set to take flight to Tokyo.Tickets for the seated shows go on sale on Monday February  at am, and are limited to four per person, with guests unable to enter the premises unless accompained by the lead booker.The Wonderwall singer is currently working on his fourth album since Oasis split up in ."},{"url":null,"title":"fans-vote-outlander-star-sam-heughan-to-be-next-batman","story":"The Outlander star received, votes in the survey by entertainment site JustJared, receiving over % of votes cast.It was announced last month that director Matt Reeves would take over as director for the next Batman film, which is due to be released in .Read more:Outlanderrsquos depiction of Bonnie Prince Charlie branded a travestyThe change means that Ben Affleck will not be ing as the Caped Crusader, leaving the role vacant.The poll saw the -year-old win outover Supernatural star Jensen Ackles, who received justover , votes.Other popular contenders included singerDiego Boneta and Twilights Taylor Lautner.Scottish heartthrob Richard Madden failed to make the list, even though he was tipped as the new James Bond by one of his producers on hit TV show The Bodyguard.Read more:Bodyguard star Richard Madden in further rumours over James Bond roleFans shared their delight at Heughans resounding win on Twitter after the actor retweeted the news.Vicky Gilmour said: \"Nobody  comes near - no contest!\"Barb Sherfinski has confidence that the star would make a perfect Batman: \"Playing Batman is in the eyes!

But most observers believe this to be highly unlikely and that the process will move towards the key vote at the end of the month.While like tonightrsquos vote, the one on February  will be a next-steps decision, which will not be legally binding, the Whitehall sources made clear, politically, it will be enormously important.One referred to it as a ldquosemi-meaningful vote. The meaningful vote on the PMrsquos fully-formed Plan B is not expected until March.As MPs began their latest debate on Brexit the prospect of defeat for Mrs May appeared to be receding after leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested it was \"highly unlikely\" that Eurosceptic Tories would rebel after all.Members of the backbench Conservative European Research Group had threatened to vote down a Government motion, which they said effectively endorsed efforts to block a no-deal Brexit.But ministers warned that defeat for the PM would send the \"wrong signal\" to Brussels about the possibility of Parliament uniting behind the revised Withdrawal Agreement which Mrs May is seeking.Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, told potential rebels that Parliament was not an \"internal debating society\" and European negotiators would be watching to seeMPs were showing \"consistency\".\"What we say is looked at and listened to by those that we are negotiating with,\" the Scot told BBC Radio s Today programme.Read more:BBC Question Time faces fresh row over claims it edited SNP retort to former UKIP candidate\"They will be looking to see whether Parliament is showing consistency because in the debates and the votes we had recently there were two things: one was that Parliament said we dont want there to be no-deal and that we will sign up to the Prime Ministers dealwe are able to get changes to the Irish backstop.\"Our European partners will be watching our debate and listening today to seethey get the impression thatthey were to make those concessions, Parliament would definitely deliver on that.\"However, Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister, argued Conservatives should not be \"associated with anything\" that \"seems to take no-deal off the table\".Members of the ERG have been lobbying Downing Street for two days to amend the wording of Mrs Mays motion for the Valentines Day vote, which asks the Commons to \"reiterate\" its support for the approach approved in an earlier set of votes on January .MPs voted on that date to send Mrs May back to Brussels to seek an alternative to the \"backstop\" provisions in her EU Withdrawal Agreement which are intended to ensure the Irish border stays open after Brexit.But they also gave a majority the same day to a non-binding amendment calling on the Government to rule out a no-deal outcome.Some Eurosceptics would welcome no-deal, while others believe it must be kept as a weapon in the Governments armoury to ensure maximum leverage in extracting concessions from the EU.Speaking as Downing Street confirmed it would not amend the wording of the motion, backbencher Lee Rowley said: \"The Government is essentially asking me to vote for something tonight - taking no- deal off the table - which isnt Government policy.\"We are all genuinely scratching our heads this morning asking what on earth they are doing. Instead of putting forward badly worded motions, the Government should be properly focusing on the Malthouse compromise - the one and only option which brings together Leavers and Remainers and, vitally, will command a majority in Parliament.\"ERG members declined to confirm whether there would be a rebellion or speculate on possible numbers involved.But Mr Rees-Mogg, the groups chairman, signalled three hours before voting was due to take place that the potential revolt was off.He told ITV News: \"This is a secondary issue, rather than a primary one, and that is why it is highly unlikely people will be voting against this motion.\"Mrs Mays spokesman told reporters: \"It is important that MPs support the Prime Minister today in order to send another clear message to Brussels on the need to address Parliaments concerns about the backstop, so we can leave on time with a deal on March .\"John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, selected only three of the  amendments tabled for debate on the floor of the Commons.MPs are set to vote on a Labour amendment demanding that Mrs May hold a meaningful vote on her plan by February  or hand power to Parliament to decide the next steps.Also selected were an SNP amendment calling for a three-month extension to Brexit negotiations and a demand from pro-EU backbenchers led by Tory Anna Soubry for the publication of the latest official assessments of the likely economic impact of no deal.The latest showdown comes as Dutch PM Mark Rutte told the Financial Times the Netherlands was already benefiting from businesses relocating from a \"diminished\" Britain.But Mrs Mays spokesman insisted Number  \"disagrees entirely\" with Mr Ruttes stance, adding: \"Employment is at a record high, exports are at a record high, companies are continuing to invest in the UK.\"Deloitte named the UK as Europes leading destination for foreign direct investment and London as the worlds top city for investment just last month.\"In a bid to keep lines open with EU leaders, Mrs May spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis on Wednesday evening and is expected to make further phone calls over the course of Thursday.Peoples Vote protesters seeking a second EU referendum gathered outside Parliament to demonstrate against what they termed a \"blindfold Brexit\".And pro-Brexit campaigners from the Leave Means Leave movement delivered a Valentines Day card for the PM to Downing Street."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-is-costing-britain-800m-a-week-or-80bn-since-eu-referendum-says-bank-of-england-policymaker","story":"Gertjan Vlieghe, an external member of the central banks Monetary Policy Committee, also suggested that the shock of a no-deal orce could see interest rates slashed.He explained that, since the June  vote, two per cent had been shaved off GDP.

It’s all linked in.“It’s about truly understanding the value of grass. If you value it, and you manage it through the season it can have a real impact on profitability.”Knowledge Transfer Specialist at QMS, Emily Grant, said: “Spring grass is hugely valuable to any livestock system, whether for lambing ewes, calving cows or growing youngstock.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be.

This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work.

Not just in the services they provide, but, as one of the biggest employers in Highland, council jobs are fundamental to the sustainability of many communities. So a budget for jobs is really good news for people.ldquoA key element of the feedback we received is that we have many cumbersome, complicated and bureaucratic processes.

Basically, we need to get a grip on our expenditure. As a result we have been examining every budget line and turning over every stone, to make sure that we are getting the best results from the resources being used and challenging where performance can be improved.ldquoIf you always do the same things in the same way, you will get the same results. It is time to change how we do things and so this is a budget for change.\"The change fund is an exciting element of our budget strategy and will underpin our programme of change over the coming year.Council leader Margaret Davidson said: ldquoThis is a decent, thoughtful and ambitious budget which will help move us into the future, protecting jobs and services.\"It aims to set the council on a journey of much needed change. We are all ambitious for improvement and what has struck me is the huge buy-in from all staff in challenging circumstances.ldquoThis budget will enable us to be sustainable and I am really confident that we have the necessary knowledge and expertise in our top team to take forward the change programme that is required.Chief executive Donna Manson added: ldquoThis budget process has been about us being connected. Connected to our communities, to our staff, to our partners, to each other ndash building relationships and enabling better conversations and improved understanding.ldquoI really appreciate the input from staff across the organisation during the whole engagement process, and for some really honest feedback. I am equally delighted with the really positive engagement across the political groups.ldquoWe need to manage all our resources, to redesign, to become more resilient, to be more efficient, to invest in our workforce and to plan for the future. We need to embed effective performance management and effective scrutiny.ldquoThe Corporate Plan will be coming to council in March and this will focus on scrutiny and driving performance.

But after holding the first AGM last week, the group now wants to go after larger projects through the lottery funding.The ultimate ambition is to renovate Dingwall Town Hall and ensure it is brought into regular and sustained use by locals and visitors as a focal point of the town.Before that, the DCDC directors and trustees, comprising Janet Bowen, Debbie Downie, Robin Lingard and Nigel Greenwood have been ldquosting through the communityrsquos suggestions for improvements to the town.Mrs Bowen said: ldquoDingwall is very fortunate to have a number of organisations which are dedicated to making the town an attractive and welcoming place. But we want to use our charitable status to unlock funding for capital projects which should make a signicant dference in raising Dingwallrsquos profile.The first of those projects out of the traps has been developed with the help of the Dingwall History Society and is a heritage trail around the town which stops off at around a dozen sites.Among them are the memorial next to the train station, the birthplace of MacBeth ndash Dingwall Castle, as well as the Macdonald Monument and others.Mrs Bowen said: ldquoUsing a series of display  to highlight to both local people and visitors the richness of Dingwallrsquos history, especially as a Viking settlement.A sticking point however is that the bridge over the Dingwall canal is closed due to safety concerns.ldquoThe big issue here, of course, is the future of the footbridge across the Dingwall canal, which has been out of use for some time now because of safety fears. The community council is very anxious to bring it back into use and we are looking at what role we might play in helping to bring it back into use.Many local groups feel that Dingwallrsquos Viking heritage has been a little neglected but in  archaeologists and historians managed to flesh out the legends.

It is remarkable the teachers are able to care for and teach the pupils in such a damp, cramped building.ldquoThere is a desperate need for a new building, delivered in consultation with parents and teachers.

The body responsible for food standards and nutrition in Scotland is currently consulting on a range of proposals, including mandatory calorie labelling. Food Standards Scotland has said the country’s diet is too high in calories, fats, sugars, and salt, which can lead to type  diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Now, Dundee City Council’s community safety and public protection committee is expected to formally endorse the watchdog’s suggestions, stating that “mandatory means” are necessary to address problems which cost Scotland £.bn a year. In its draft consultation response, the committee said it wants to make outlets serve smaller portions and print the calorie contents of meals on menus.A report to councillors, who will be asked to formally approve the response at a meeting on Monday, states: “There is no single solution to tackling the issue of a poor diet, however eating outside the home is one of the areas where change is needed as in many cases the food and drink on offer tends to be a less healthy option.”The council’s response argues that as well as compulsory calorie labelling, food inspectors should be trained to carry out checks to ensure premises are meeting the new regulations. It states: “Businesses need to cease practices that encourage over-consumption.“This will require defining carefully which practices encourage overeating. Multi-packs and ‘go large’ promotions on meals and drinks should be banned. Healthy meal deals could be promoted.”: Restaurants could face curb on portion size and calorie countIt added that “public sector premises should be exemplars and early adopters” of the new measures.Alan Ross, the convener of the committee, said: “Basically, we are trying to promote healthier lestyle choices.“It’s about people living longer, reducing the strain on the NHS and the benefits eating healthily.”NHS Tayside dietetic consultant in public health nutrition Joyce Thompson said: “NHS Tayside is aware that food eaten outside the home currently makes up a signicant part of people’s diets and therefore welcomes the Food Standards Scotland’s consultation on proposals to improve the out of home food environment.“The proposals, which include consideration of portion sizes, calorie information on the menus, improving quality of food sold out of home, and shting marketing and promotion strategies from unhealthy products to healthier options, offer important steps in the solution to tackle overweight and obesity.”Jonathon Clark, owner of Clarks bakery in the city, said he would comply with any new rules but did not think mandatory calorie labelling “makes much sense”.He said: “We have a salad bar at the front of our shops and have tried to promote healthier eating in our shops.“I don’t think it makes much sense - somebody wants to eat something healthy they’ll make it themselves at home.“If it’s a rainy day then we are at our busiest as people want comfort food.”The proposal has emerged just weeks after American chain Fatburger opened a branch on Dundee’s Reform Street.The business is famed for its quadruple Fatburger challenge, comprising a meaty tower of four burgers sandwiched in a brioche bun with mustard, relish, onion, pickles, tomato, lettuce and mayonnaise. Heather Peace, Head of public health nutrition at Food Standards Scotland said: “We are delighted that Dundee City Council are planning to take part in our Out of Home consultation.“We would also encourage other organisations and consumers to have their say so we can gather as many views as possible before the consultation ends on  February to inform our Out of Home Strategy.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brian monteith think the unthinkable nicola s on the way out","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The SNP is losing its nerve. Why can we tell this is happening  Simple, #because we are at last #seeing the symptoms of decay in its once strict internal discipline.SNP politicians briefing against each other, hostile opposition to official policy, histrionics about BBC bias as a deflection from what’s going wrong with the party’s strategy and policies – and now even the open talk of notNicola Sturgeon should go, but when and where to.I am not making this up. There is no conspiracy. You only need to have been reading, watching or listening to the news to see the SNP is imploding.Firstly, let’s get the Salmond dficulty out the road. Whatever happens with the pending Alex Salmond prosecution it has caused deep isions around competing loyalties within the SNP. Supporters of the ­Salmond or Sturgeon tribes have been briefing against each other. Were Alex Salmond to be cleared of everything, such behaviour will not be forgotten and of course he could be expected to seek re-election. What then for Sturgeon, what then for the SNP  More bitterness, manoeuvring and ision. Let’s not kid ourselves, the SNP will never be the same again, either because of something Alex Salmond might have done, orinnocent, because of the way Nicola Sturgeon has handled the accusations and process – or a mixture of both.Then we have policies like the Car Park Tax. It will be unjust, having no sense in regard to who pays it, who is given a free pass and whether or not they can afford it. The earnings of the driver or the size of car will not ­matter. And, get this, there will be VAT on top of the tax – because the tax will be a bill presented by the employer providing a serviceand so it attracts  per cent VAT on top. £ would become £, or £ would become £.I also have it on good authority that the tax was offered by the SNP to the Greens as a bribe to get their support for the budget – not the other way round. So it is an SNP Car Park Tax that the party cannot escape blame for.No wonder some SNP politicians are openly letting it be known they do not agree with it – it will cost them votes and cost the party seats in Holyrood.That never used to happen, but discipline has gone out of the window under Nicola Sturgeon’s autocratic husband and we rule. Where  in the Western world does so much power rest in a married couple ­holding the posts of party chief executive and Government leader  Not Romania, not the Philippines. Then there have been the protests about an audience member who gave the SNP Culture Secretary a roasting on BBC’s Question Time. The ­programme makers and the BBC have been accused of bias. This is a ­classic deflection of seeking to take away from and avoid discussing the home truths the member of the public made about SNP hypocrisy. Secondly, the man’s politics, religion, allegiances and number of appearances are all irrelevant – are SNP politicians and fellow travellers saying he should not be allowed to speak, that he should have duct tape over his mouth  Is that what an independent Scotland would be like  We also have growing speculation on Nicola Sturgeon being replaced as leader or retiring before she is served notice. Now that’s a new development, partly fuelled by yet another trip to the United States when the real day job of fixing our schools and hospitals is here at home.

The aim is to encourage conversation and share experiences and knowledge about their own encounters with nature.Suzy Lee, ATLASArts film programmer, commented: “We are really excited about working with both Portree Primary and Budhmor House to offer this screening that encourages sharing and discussion.We’ve had a great response to the film and to our extended programme, so we look forward to showing the film in a new environment.”Centre with the primary seven girls from Portree Primary.Angus Beaton, a care worker at the centre praised the event for bridging the generational gap.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GAMEKEEPER-SCOTT-MACKENZIE-2.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillationwithin  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Ambulance response times to cardiac arrests are typically longer than this, as in Northern Ireland they average  minutes. Andthis is why communities across the Northern Ireland have formed these community first responder schemes.Volunteers are trained, and dispatched at the same time as the responding ambulance crew, by NIAS.The Braid Valley is now joining this movement.Leonard Wharry, the scheme coordinator, explained: We aim to go live in early summer with a scheme covering Ballymena, Broughshane and the surrounding rural areas.Were raising money for defibrillators and other equipment, but our priority is to recruit and train volunteers.

But that is just one aspect of an ambitious multi-phase redevelopment project at the site.“The building had been lying empty for about five years and we are now turning it into a new facility to house everything that the charity does under one roof,” explained Via Wings founder Gail Redmond.Having previously rented premises in the town, the charity worked hard on fundraising projects for several years and received two signicant financial gts which allowed it to buy a building. In  an offer was put in to purchase the former pub, and in September last year they finally moved in to the charity’s new home and began renovations to turn the building into a community facility.

Redmondshows Halax representatives Alan McLachlan and Gillian Boyd around the charitys new social enterprise shop, Wings n Things.“Mrs McFadden would have done a lot of work for charity within our town and in the local community so we really have brought that sense of community back in here,” Ms Redmond explained.Over the past six months charity staff and volunteers have been busy turning the run down pub building into a vibrant community hub which now houses a food parcel distribution project, a catering and education programme for vulnerable adults and those with learning dficulties and a senior citizens’ lunch club. Via Wings at Wellington House also provides space for after schools and parent and toddler groups, a monthly supper club and games nights, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities for many isolated and vulnerable members of the local community.Yesterday the charity held a special event to mark the opening of its new shop Wings ‘n’ Things, which will sell shabby chic and new craft items made by local crafters.Among the guests at the celebration were representatives from the Halax Foundation, which has provided funding for Via Wings to help it expand its Dare  Care project, which distributes food parcels to people in need.Thanking the Halax Foundation for providing £, towards the salary of a project manager, Ms Redmond said: “Their funding has enabled us to run the project much more efficiently because it has grown from a cupboard-sized project into a three-centred project.“We now provide food parcels to around  families every month, which averages out at about  people.Discovery of mans body sparks murder probePolice called to deal with agitated male carrying alleged offensive weapon Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DROM | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DROM | Article Teaser\"“As the number of people using our foodstore increases month-on-month the manager’s role is essential and the funding from the Halax Foundation ensures that we can continue to expand and develop the foodstore.”Gillian Boyd, trustee of the Halax Foundation NI, commented: “The Halax Foundation for Northern Ireland is delighted to support the important work of Via Wings. This particular award will enable the organisation to help those who are most vulnerable in their local community. We wish them every success in the future.”So far half of the old pub building has been renovated and Via Wings at Wellington House now boasts new offices, counselling rooms and a conference room. But that’s not the end of the redevelopment work.The charity is in the process of constructing a new coffee shop with a sensory garden and play area, which should be open within the next few months. And it also has long-term plans to redevelop another section of the building and create a wellbeing centre.“The wellbeing centre is going to be phase four,” Ms Redmond continued. “It would be our passion to have it up and running by the end of the year, but that will depend on fundraising and securing the necessary funding.“We hope the centre will help people – men and women – learn to live with their mental health. We want to provide things like reflexology, aromatherapy, breathing techniques, helping people learn about self care.”Praising the charity’s staff and volunteers for their dedication and hard work, she added: “Without them we couldn’t run this project. We have a team here that have a passion to serve this community, to walk in unity with them and see change happen.”• About the charity and its work...Founded in  by Gail Redmond, Via Wings was set up to help people in need in Dromore and surrounding areas.The faith-based charity’s aim “is to show God’s love in a loving, caring, practical, non-judgemental way.”It runs a range of projects designed to tackle problems such as poverty, loneliness, isolation, deprivation and more.

In his opinion, the concrete path would require fencing to ensure livestock on either side could not gather on the path.The Director explained that the landowner had informed the council that he would be unhappy iding his field. However design options had yet to be produced.The Director added thatthe access path is approved, for insurance purposes, there would need to be a survey undertaken on the remains of a chimney that is located in the field adjacent to the path.The Head of Building Controlsaid that while the proposed access path would be restrictedfor vehicles it would be wide enough to accomodategrass cutting machineryand wheelchair access.The Director advised in response to Councillor Paul Gribben that the original lane, which was previously used to access the Graveyard from the Ballymackilreiny Road, was removed by a previous landowner many years ago.‘Bid to dump radio active waste in ABC area is opposed,’ say Sinn Fein Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"locals help raise 7 000 in memory of sienna","story":"Members of a Dromore workout group helped a Hillsborough woman raise #, in memory of her premature baby daughter Sienna, whom she lost eight years ago.Alison Harrison-Mitchell, owner of Paul Shappiro hairdressers in Lisburn, has been raising funds for the Perinatal Trust Fund for many years.Sherecently presented £, to the Royal Victoria Hospital’s neo-natal unit.Among those who helped raise the money were members of the Dromore Spinning Class at Dromore Community Centre, who gathered £, while training for a maracycle.Alison, now a mother of three young boys, has over the eyar raised more than £, for the Perinatal Trust Fund , which helps to care for sick children.Alison’s daughter Sienna, was born  weeks premature on April , , and lived for just two days she weighed just lb oz.“I love to do these things to keep Sienna’s memory and name alive,” said Alison. “I also like to get recognition for the charity as well.”The £, Alison helped to raise will go towards providing a defibrillator and two phototherapy blankets for the neo-natal unit.It also included £, Alison raised by selling off reindeer food to local shops and businesses.“When we are doing anything and I get an amount of money I contact the technician at the neonatal and ask them what they need,” she said.“If they tell me what something costs then I know how much money to aim for.

After giving the matter some thought, Squinter has been unable to separate two candidates, and so the prize is jointly awarded. First co-winner is Andrea Leadsom, Tory Leader of the House, for her reaction to Donald Tusk’s statement that there’s “a special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit “without a sketch of a plan”.Andrea’s response was rather more temperate than that of Sammy Wilson, who opined that Mr Tusk was a “devilish, trident wielding, euro maniac”. She remarked, with what would appear at first blush to be commendable restraint: “The man has no manners.”But on hearing Andrea’s mention of the word “manners”, a little bell went off somewhere deep in Squinter’s hippocampus and after a short period of beard-scratching and pencils-sucking, it came to Squinter why the Honourable Member is on rather thin ice when it comes to matters of polite conduct.Come back in time with Squinter to the summer of , just two weeks before Britain voted to leave the EU. Andrea was locked in a battle with Theresa May for leadership of the Conservative Party. In an interview with The Times, when asked why the party should opt for her, she replied that her rival “possibly has nieces, nephews, lots of people. But I have children who are going to have children who will directly be part of what happens next.”So there we have it. Andrea pitched for the top job by saying having children gives her more of a stake in the country. At which point, we should remind ourselves that Theresa May has spoken honestly and movingly about the fact that she and her husband Philip were unable to have children.Manners  Yih pays yer money…Joint winner is British Transport Secretary Chris Grayling who announced on Friday that he was cancelling the £ million contract he had awarded to Seaborne Freight just before Christmas to provide a ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend to ease the pressure on the port of Dover should the UK crash out with no deal.Mr Grayling’s tenure has been one of the great comedy shows of British politics and it’s widely believed that he remains in office only to direct fire away from more senior colleagues. Not that he could have seen this mess developing. After all, Seaborne Freight was a highly respected company with a long history of professional and responsible conduct in the business of ferries and freight, right  Well, since the company only hit the news in December you probably don’t need Squinter to remind you that Seaborne Freight:• Was a completely new company• Didn’t own a ship• Cut and pasted its website terms and conditions from a pizza delivery firmand an online boutiqueThe high-flying cabinet minister sent out to back Grayling when the contract was scrubbed was Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. You know, the bloke was Secretary of State here for a while and nobody noticed.Chris’ll be gone by the end of the week, then.Fail to prepare#LET’S be honest, Jim Wells isn’t flavour of the month within the DUP. The South Down MLA had the party whip withdrawn last spring after he fell out with the top brass over his claim that they had reneged on a promise to reinstate him as Health Minister after he stepped down in  over an election hustings row.Jimbo claimed then party leader party leader Peter Robinson promised to reinstate him when andthe furious furoreblew over . He further alleged that when Arlene Foster took over as leader she ignored two written requests from him to honour Peter’s pledge. These days Jimbo’s something of a voice in the wilderness, technically still a DUP MLA but shorn of any authority to speak for the party. Which makes him of considerable interest to journalists, since the resentment he clearly still feels makes him a little bit more willing to open up about things than other DUP reps.Jim’s been at it again this week and, given the state we’re in at the moment, you’ll probably not be surprised to hear that it’s Brexit-related. Jim revealed that at the extraordinary meeting at which the party decided to back Leave in the months leading up to the EU referendum in , there was zero discussion of what a Leave vote would mean for the local economy. This would be an awkward revelation for most parties, but after the tsunami of controversies that the DUP has been through in the past couple of years, it seems to have reached the point that its brand is so polluted the tin can’t get any more dented, the label any dirtier. But that’s not the disaster that it would certainly be for any other party because the DUP’s substantial vote clearly consists of people who don’t care what they get up to as long as they’re not Sinn Féin.Lack of planning – it’ll do for ye every time. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail, that’s the old saying and nowhere does it ring more true than in the crazy world of Brexit. Let’s take a look at a few of the most notorious failures of a lack of foresight and seewe can work out where the DUP Brexit calamity fits in…Betamax’Member when video cassettes were the most exciting innovation in the history of technology  You don’t  Well, you must be under , so let’s seewe can explain. Two Japanese giants of the global electronics industry were caught up in the race to win control of the massive new market. JVC produced the eventually successful VHS format, while Sony produced the toploading Betamax system. Although the Betamax system was of a superior picture quality, it was considerably more expensive and had a shorter recording time. At a meeting in , Sony were advised by Matsushita engineers to switch to the VHS format, but declined. It wa a historic mistake, dealing the company a crippling financial blow from which it would take years to recover.Ford EdselFord were inordinately pleased with the Edsel, a new model released in the United States in , the year after the Ford family relinquished control of the company. The Edselwas designed to give Ford the upper-hand in the highly competitive premium intermediate market . The company missed the design boat, though, as the car harked back to an earlier age at a time when families were increasingly turning to compact vehicles. The Edsel was discontinued two years later, with sales signicantly less than half the break-even sales figure. Executives took their eye off the ball and didn’t realise the Edsel was flopping until over .bnhad been spent on design, manufacture and new dealerships. To this day, new models that fail are still referred to in the US automobile market as ‘Edsels’.New CokeIn the mid-s, as other soft drinks were increasingly threatening the dominance of Coca-Cola, the company decided it was going to ditch the original Coke formula and go with an improved ‘New Coke’.The  launch was a disaster and sales were badly hit, particularly in the southern states where Coca-Cola was considered an integral part of American culture. Tens of thousands of complaints flooded into company HQ weekly. The problem was not so much with the taste – the company had disastrously underestimated the hold that the Coca-Cola brand had on the American psyche. Smelling blood, rivals Pepsi began a new ad campaign with the strapline ‘Now I Know Why Coke Did It’ . Fans started booing ads for New Coke at large sports events. Just  days after New Coke was launched, the company announced that it was bringing back the old formula.Has to be a Brexit message in there somewhere, no "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-13.55.54.png","title":"eye on the past february","story":"RUC men sided with loyalist strikers last MayA SECRET memo prepared by British army intelligence has revealed that senior RUC men were closely involved with the Ulster Workers’ Council strike last May.The memo, prepared for Whitehall ministers some time ago, shows also that unormed members of the RUC “connived at and assisted with the maintenance of UWC and UDA roadblocks”.Referring to Special Branch actions during the strike the report says: “Co-opted personnel were isolated from information on events by being sent on routine tasks or being given rest days.”The ‘co-opted personnel’ referred to are Special Branch men recruited by British military intelligence to keep an eye on what is happening within the Special Branch.“As a result a ally clear picture of RUC reliability area by area has not emerged,” says the report.And it goes on to say that RUC activity of a routine nature appears to have failed by as much as  per cent.It goes on to predict that in a situation where there were large scale attacks on the Catholic population  per cent of the Special Branch would throw their weight behind loyalist gangs. A copy of the report, which was prepared as a briefing document for ministers in the Wilson Government, found its way into the hands of a number of journalists in London recently.Besides casting considerable doubt on the loyalty of the RUC to the British Government it claims that  to  per cent of the UDR could be regarded as hostile during a doomsday situation.BRITISH military policemen are being trained for civilian duties at a military training camp in Kent and it is believed that a large number of them will be drafted into Belfast and Derry within the next few weeks.The British Redcaps are expected to be used in areas like Falls and Andersonstown to take over from infantry patrols which will be withdrawn from the street.A number of UDR men from the thBattalion have attended a two-week course at the same camp and one report suggests that they may be used to form the nucleus of a ‘community police force’ in Belfast for a trial period. There have been two previous attempts to phase in military policemen to civilian duties. In the Bogside area of Derry they were withdrawn after a few days because of resistence by local people.Price sisters’ lives threatenedTHE Prisoners’ Aid Committee in London has said it is concerned about the safety of Irish political prisoners in British jails because “there is evidence of systematic victimisation by prison authorities and attempts to create hostility among other prisoners.”According to the PAC the Price sisters’ lives have been threatened by prisoners in Durham Jail. Since Christmas seven Irish prisoners have been ‘arbitarily’ moved to prisons far away from their families and another Irish prisoner’s cell has been set on fire. Officially the Home Office would not comment on the allegations but other sources firmly rejected them as being completely unfounded. There was nothing unusual in prisoners being moved to other jails under the nomal “dispersal systems”, they said.Since being transferred to the women’s wing of Durham from Brixton Prison, London, Dolours and Marion Price have been put on dferent floors in dference parts of the wing, the PAC statement said. The reason given by a deputy governor, Miss Ford, for the separation was “security”.The PAC said that the cells to which the sisters were moved were filfthy.The PAC said that in a letter to their father, the sisters said that their lives had been threatened by other prisoners all of whom were in need of medical treatment, some being “drug addicts or sex perverts”. They are being “continually harassed” by short-term prisoners, who wanted information to try to sell stories about the girls to newspapers, the statement said.“They have asked to be separated from Judith Ward, whose behaviour is bizarre, but Marion has been put into the neighbouring cell to this prisoner. Despite the fact that the Home Office describes Durham as a top security prison, Dolours and Marion and Judith Ward, are the only Category A prisoners there.“The other  prisoners in the women’s wing are Category C and they subject the girls to continuous anti-Irish abuses and obscenities. Miss Ford, the deputy governor, has instructed them to associate with these prisoners, although some of them have threatened to poision the Price sisters’ food. The families are complainning to the Home Office about the treatment of Mr Price and Mrs Claire Murphy, the girls’ sister, by Miss Ford on their last two visits. This treatment represents a marked worsening of prisoner attitudes from that of the prison staff in Brixton where the girls were during their hunger-strike.”Pay rise for home helpsHOME helps in the Andersonstown areas who were threatening strike action some months ago have just been given a big pay rise.The new rate for the job, which paid only p per hour this time last year, has climbed to p.After the reorganisation of local government services home helps who were working in the Antrim County Council area protested that they were being paid p an hour less than colleagues who were working in the area formerly controlled by Belfast Corporation.In some parts of Andersonstown women working within a hundred yards of each other were being paid at rates which were   p dferent.A pay rationalisation last December by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board, which now controls the district’s home helps, brought all of the women’s pay up to a standard rate of p per hour.Most of the women work at least ten hours per week, with the average time spent looking after old and housebound people being around  hours.Local Ads in paperPAULA’S Glen Road Shopping CentreLadies and Children’s Outfitters.

The amendment to the Civil Partnership Bill is being tabled by Conservative peer Lord Hayward.Last year, Secretary of State Karen Bradley told the Commons that the Government would allow a free votethe matter was raised in Westminster, but Baroness Williams opposed the measure when it was first proposed earlier this month.Conor Loughran, LGBT+ officer of the National Union of Students-Union of Students in Irelandsaid the group were appealing to the Minister not to stand in the way \"of the true love of thousands of couples in Northern who just wanted to be treated as equals under the law\".“The Government has to decide whether to stand by Karen Bradley’s public commitment from last year, or to oppose equality for LGBT+ people here. We hope they choose love,” he said.If the amendment passes same-sex marriage would be extended to Northern Ireland, but it would include a clause allowing the Assembly to overturn the decision within six months.Same sex couples are allowed to wed in England, Wales, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, but it is against the law in Northern Ireland.In November  a majority of MLAs in the Assembly supported the introduction of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, but the measure was blocked by the DUP using a controversial petition of concern.Colum EastwoodAn April  Sky News poll showed % support for marriage equality amongst the Northern Ireland public, with just % opposed.

from cross border organisations Central Border Area Networkand the East Border Regionwere before the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement on Thursday to discuss the challenges facing border authorities.ICBAN chief executive Shane Campbell said the need to foster cross-border collaboration was even more acute than ever, given the challenges of Brexit.Mr Campbell also said the importance of investments on both sides of the border could not be underestimated and the continuation or replacement of cooperation funds must be a key priority post-Brexit.\" width\"\" \"\"

developing a cross-border investment fund to replace any possible loss of the EU’s Interreg and peace funds.“It is hereby recommended that consideration is given to developing an island-wide territorial cohesion policy, which would include a cross-border infrastructure and investment plan   fund, to replace any loss of common Interreg and peace funds,” he said.“However, there is little evidence of such a debate or consideration yet on either side of the border, which is very concerning.”Councillor PJ O’Hanlon of the East Border Region said: “Cross border cooperation has never been easy and must not be taken lightly.“Over the last  years the members of East Border Region have believed that cross border co-operation makes sense.“In the face of Brexit it still makes sense.”Committee member Brendan Smith said cohesion funding was needed to help the region.The Fianna Fail TD for Cavan-Monaghan said: “We should be making a very strong demand for our region, north and south, to get specic cohesion funding because of the challenges we will face as a result of Brexit.”Representatives and committee members voiced their disappointment at the Irish government’s decision to reschedule the A motorway in Northern Ireland due to the cost overrun in the Nation Children’s Hospital.Sinn Fein MP Francie Molloy said: “Unfortunately this week we’ve seen the lack of commitment from the Taoiseach on that one and worse again using it as a political football.”Mr Campbell said the border area had not received its fair share of infrastructure investment compared to other areas, despite there being a high dependency on travel by road in the region.There are more than  million vehicle crossings between the Ireland and Northern Ireland each year, about five million of which are freight crossings.“Both Governments must formally recommit to the long-planned A-N Dublin to Derry dualling project, highlighting its priority nature, and re-pledging what was originally agreed,” he said.“Elsewhere, upgrades are needed to the N-A from Sligo to Ballygawley, the East-West link to Dundalk, and the N from Sligo to Carrick-on-Shannon, with an extension of the M to Cavan Town.He also said the A from Coleraine to Monaghan was a key road corridor for North-South freight movement in agri-food, minerals, engineering and quarry products.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A defaced road sign on the border between Donegal and Derry Senator Gerard Craughwell expressed his fear that Brexit, whether it ended up being a crash-out or a negotiated one, would “change the relationships that exist in the border region forever”.He said the mismatch of funding bothered him.He said the Irish government would continue to push for funding for financial support for projects along the border but he said there was a possibility that the UK would not provide equal funding.“You finish up with a poorer relation the other side of the border.“You could for example end up with a decent motorway in Donegal that stops at the border,” he said.“I remember years ago travelling through Northern Ireland you knew you were in Northern Ireland because you hit the best roads in the country, now you know you’re in Northern Ireland because you hit the worst roads in the country.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37812018.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/kill.jpg","title":"ulster woman set alight by candle during mass saved by gaa star","story":" Hi

They were well prepared.ldquoThey had carried out research which helped them to face questions about migration and environmental issues. There was no doubt, they had been given the short straw as the other countries were ready to attack them for their current position in wanting to leave the EU.ldquoHowever, the students put aside their own views and represented the country they were delegated, in this debate.ldquoBeing the UK is what made it so challenging and also so rewarding as they did a fantastic job.Mrs Orsi said: ldquoNot being able to participate in future debates is only one of the educational detriments to leaving the EU.ldquoI think our students are going to be greatly affected on many levels, both in terms of academic opportunities, funding and employment.

A talented actor, who shone in the schoolrsquos theatre productions, she applied for and got a place at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardf.Niamh was fortunate that while not academically minded, she found that drama, theatre studies and English always came ldquonaturally to her in school.The youngest of five siblings, Niamh says that she had always wanted to leave Castlewellan for ldquoan adventure. But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo. If it helps one person seek help, then thatrsquos great.ldquoPeople could be sitting with mental problems and they donrsquot know it.

It does not have to be in control of you. Itrsquos easier said that done as itrsquos a long and slow process but itrsquos absolutely possible.While she has excelled in support roles such as the policewoman in The Fall and a nurse in Holby City, Niamh has her eyes set on being centre stage and ldquoplaying a really bad person in the future.ldquoI really want to play the evil person in something.

Hutley was given another chance around  minutes and this time took full advantage after Enniskillen had been deemed to be offside on the back of a break from Down scrum half, Chris Gibson.For the remainder of the first half, and indeed for  minutes in the second half, the score remained at - with both teams trading blows, but neither were able to alter their account on the scoreboard.Down did have their chances to take the lead, but lacked the finesse in handling that they had shown against their rivals from Carrick and Omagh in previous rounds.As the game entered the final quarter, Enniskillen managed to extend their lead, scoring a try by barging over from short range following a well won line-out.With Enniskillen now in possession of a  point lead, Down were left with no alternative but to chase the game.

Well done girlsAlex Robinson was the sole East Down representative in the boysrsquo race and should be very proud of his th place in the  runner field.Ollie Robinson was prominent throughout the U- boysrsquo race over a k distance and did extremely well to take third place behind the highly-regarded Willowfield pair of Colm McKee and Finn Cross.Emily Burns, who impresses more every time she runs, was unlucky to miss out on a podium position, though was well worth her fourth place and another up and coming star Kara Trainor was hot on her heels in th place mdash out of  finishers.Mackenzie Murray was again a lone wolf in the U- boysrsquo contest over k and he ran a controlled race to take an excellent third placeThe U- girlsrsquo race, which was run simultaneously with the U-s, was a tough race and Edie Carroll was pleased to finish first in her age group, though she still has some way to go to achieve peak fitness.Her result meant that East Down AC comprising Edie, Emily and Kara from the U- competition placed second junior girls team across the age groups. So, well done everyone again.The feature of the U- boysrsquo race was the performance of Newcastle ACrsquos Christopher Neill who took the race by the scruff of the neck from the beginning of the second lap to positively run everyone  into the ground. Well done to him. Another star in the making The East Down Ladies continued their quest for honours in the Cross Country League with Niamh Kellett leading from the front and coming home in th place, supported in th place by Deirdre Weatherall and Joanne Foster, a fast finishing st.The vital fourth scorer was to be a toss up between Clare Carson and Janine Murray with Clare continuing her recent good form crossing the line in th place to give the club fourth place on the day, in the league competition.While Janine, despite struggling in the last lap, crossed the line in th place out of  finishers, for another valuable participation point.A feature of the day for me and indicative of the camaraderie engendered by cross country running, was the activity of the Murlough AC squad who as each one finished ed to the run in area to loudly cheer home their club mates, some of whom were experiencing cross country running for the first time.Such were the ovations that it must have seemed aseach had won the race.

The link with this area is part of our history, that is why I am here to meet with the council chairman and to visit local schools.The deputy mayor is keen to see links re-established between schools in France and the Ballynahinch area.ldquoThe link can help inspire young people in France and in this area and forging the link again will provide us all with new motivation, she added.David Stewart, who was a member of the former Ballynahinch, Drumaness and Spa twinning group and is now a key member of the Rowallane and Slieve Croob group, is also particularly keen for the formal link to be re-established.As someone who has visited Lamorlaye on a number of occasions and witnessed the value of cultural exchanges involving young people in particular, he hopes formal links with the French suburb can be reformed.ldquoThe old twinning link seemed to lose some of its impetus, but the Rowallane and Slieve Croob group is a much broader association, he continued.ldquoWe are delighted to have some people from Galicia with us at the moment and it would be fantasticthe Lamorlaye folk could join our group as well to be part of the Celtic region partnership.David added: ldquoYasmine has told us about some of the reformed committees in Lamorlaye, some of which are looking at environmental issues which I believe would be of interest to people in our area.Karen Patterson, acting chairwoman of the Rowallane and Slieve Croob twinning group which includes Ballynahinch, Drumaness and Spa area, is also keen to see Lamorlaye join the Celtic region partnership.ldquoYasmine approached David and we are meeting with council officials to discuss reconstituting the twinning link. She is keen to meet with local schools and while the initial focus is on those in the Ballynahinch area, we would be keen to roll this out to others, Karen explained.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council provides us with financial support as does Sport NI and we are grateful for all the support we have received. As part of our cultural heritage, looking at our past and history and aspart of our overarching Celtic nations initiative, we want to bring everyone together.Karen added: ldquoMoving forward, the focus is on culture, sports, language, arts and crafts, music and dance.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Police probe poisoning of two birds Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThe Northern Ireland bucket list -  things every person from N.I. should do before they dieTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMeningitis outbreak in N.I. - What we know so farN.I. child hasnt been seen since Sunday - P.S.N.I. investigatingDerry Girls series two trailer released          ..

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Penarth Pier Pavilion is open for youngsters on Pancake Tuesday, March  for a special pancake event with support from the Waterloo Tea Rooms, while the Italian Cultural Centre Wales will be teaching children about Italian carnival traditions.There will be plenty of music to accompany the feasting, with -man strong Welsh festival band Wonderbrass playing ious events across the town over the festival, finishing with a full band performance on March . Wonderbrass are known for their electric blend of New Orleans jazz, ska, and blues with contemporary hip-hop and funk updates.Those preferring their music a touch more traditional may prefer to sing with the Male Welsh Voice Choir, or the Criw Canu womenrsquos singing group. Both organisations will be holding open practice sessions ahead of time.Colourful carnival ribbon produced in Pembrokeshire will also be available for decorations and discounts. Perfect for colourful bunting, and many shops say festival-goers wearing the fabric will be in for special offers and discounts.The festival will open with long-distance cyclist Dave Hann.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

caves","story":"The find, carved on walls and ceilings of the caves at Creswell Crags on the border between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, is thought to be the largest collection of its kind in one place in the UK.The discovery was made byenthusiasts Hayley Clark and Ed Waters, from the Subterranea Britannica group, during a cave tour when they noticed the rare protection marks on the walls.\"Alongside lettering, the witchesrsquo marks feature symbols to trap or capture evil spirits The marks were previously thought to have been graffiti from the time before the caves were shut off.Witchesrsquo marks, orldquoapotropaic marks, from the Greek word apotrepein, ldquoto turn away, are most commonly found in historic churches and houses,near doorways, windows and fireplaces, to protect the inhabitants from evil spirits.Experts said the number and iety of the marks found in the caves is unprecedented.Among the most common are the double VV engravings, thought to reference Mary, Virgin of Virgins, and PM or Pace Maria, while other symbols are believed to be devices for capturing or trapping evil, including diagonal lines, boxes and mazes.\"The Subterranea Britannica group observing the witchesrsquo marks where the initial discovery was made The marks appear to have been added to over time and may indicate a need to strengthen the protection against underworld spirits in response to unexpected sickness, death or poor crops, the experts said.Until now the largest known quantity of witchesrsquo marks in caves in Britain was  in Somerset, but the number at Creswell Crags is far higher ndash with hundreds in one cave alone and marks now found in all the caves at the site.There may even have been more in the past, as the caves were excavated by archaeologists during the th century and were widened in the process, potentially accounting for some surfaces featuring no marks.It is the latest signicant discovery at the caves, whichprovided shelter for Neanderthal and anatomically modern people through a crucial period of human evolution between , and , years ago.The site has been a rich source of archaeological finds and even features Britainrsquos earliest cave art, with ,-year-old pictures of birds, deer, bison and horses.\"Whole walls of the caves are covered in the protective marks John Charlesworth, heritage facilitator and the tour leader at the time of the discovery of the protective marks, said: ldquoThese witchesrsquo marks were in plain sight all the time.ldquoBeing present at the moment their true signicance was revealed will stay with me forever.This remarkable place continues to give up its secrets.Academic and TV presenter Professor Ronald Hutton, an authority on folklore, said:ldquoThis discovery is signicant because it looks like the largest assemblage of protective marks ever found in British caves, and possibly anywhere in Britain.ldquoThis is a suddenly a large new area of research for historians and archaeologists, and so adds appreciatively to the importance of the Crags as a world resource.The team who look after Creswell Crags are now working with academics and experts from Historic England to better understand the signicance and extent of the discovery at the site, which is a scheduled monument.Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: ldquoCreswell Crags is already of international importance for its Ice Age art and ancient remains.ldquoTo find this huge number of protection marks from the more recent past adds a whole new layer of discovery.ldquoEven  years ago, the English countryside was a very dferent place death and disease were everyday companions and evil forces could readily be imagined in the dark.ldquoWe can only speculate on what it was the people of Creswell feared might emerge from the underworld into these caves.Creswell Crags will be launching tours of the areas containing witchesrsquo marks for the first

Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/harbour_1221.jpg","title":"belfast harbour sets new cargo record","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Belfast Harbour has handled more than  million tonnes of cargo for the first time in its history.
