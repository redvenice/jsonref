Porn star Susie Best was paid for sex by bankers who committed a huge fraud that Mr Edmonds was a victim ofEmployee Lynden Scourfield, who was jailed for 11 years in 2017, enjoyed luxury holidays, trips on banker accomplice David Mills\u0027 superyacht and sex with porn stars including escort Suzie Best.Noel is pursuing Lloyds for losses allegedly suffered when his former business Unique Group was destroyed because of the fraud.Jonathan Coad, solicitor for Mr Edmonds, on Thursday served Lloyds with a pre-case letter, needed to initiate formal proceedings which could begin as soon as December.Mr Edmonds has suggested that Mr Horta Osorio knew about the misdeeds of staff at HBOS, and on Wednesday claimed that the bank boss \u0027wants to destroy me, he wants to crush me\u0027.He also said that other Lloyds board members are at risk of police action over the case.\u0027There are members of the board who are really worried about what is really going on and there are senior executives who don\u0027t want to have their collars felt. They don\u0027t won\u0027t to be implicated when the warrants start to arrive, and they will arrive,\u0027 he said.For its part, Lloyds has rejected the basis of Mr Edmonds\u0027 claim.A Lloyds spokesman said: \u0027We are still waiting for Mr Edmonds to file his legal claim. If he does file his claim, it will be contested.\u0027Mr Coad, of Keystone Law, said: \u0027I have never been involved in a case where so much meticulous effort has been invested by so many to professionals to prepare a claim.\u0027In this case we have had first to unpick a sophisticated fraud, and then piece it together using primarily documentary evidence, but also some key evidence from witnesses to what was going on at the time.\u0027          Mr Edmonds admits his motivation to go into the Jungle is to hit Lloyds and he insists he\u0027ll win          Mark Dobson, 56, helped to ert funds from two high-risk clients to Mills\u0027 bogus businesses in return for £30,000 and lavish hospitality.He had to chase the fraudster repeatedly before receiving a suspicious bundle of documents that contained \u0027no evidence of appropriate sanctioning\u0027 in January 2007.A month later HBOS carried out a review of 38 struggling businesses that had received irregular loans from IA and together owed the bank £375million.The conclusion was damning: the bank stood to lose up to £288million from companies that had engaged QCS under Scourfield\u0027s supervision.Mr Angus confronted the conman with the findings at the bank\u0027s Bishopsgate office on 8 March 2007 - but within hours he went off sick with \u0027work-related stress\u0027 and never returned.HBOS suspended Scourfield for gross misconduct and he resigned in April 2007.The former banking giant carried out two further investigations but neither one uncovered the \u0027true nature\u0027 of Scourfield\u0027s corrupt relationship with Mills.Prosecutor Brian O\u0027Neill QC said: \u0027Some other employees of the Bank do not emerge well from the investigation, most particularly Paul Burnett, who was Scourfield\u0027s immediate line manager.\u0027There is little doubt that his apparent lack of oversight was partly responsible for Scourfield\u0027s ability to act in the way that he did and for as long as he did.\u0027He continued: \u0027Had Burnett and others paid closer attention to the crib sheet figures, Scourfield\u0027s activities may have been identified sooner..\u0027Burnett lost his position at the Bank as a result of his failures as a manager.\u0027Jurors were told \u0027systems and processes undoubtedly contributed to Scourfield\u0027s ability to behave dishonestly\u0027 as he began \u0027exploiting systemic and personnel weaknesses which he knew to exist\u0027.But Mr O\u0027Neill insisted there is \u0027no evidence\u0027 Mr Burnett or any other HBOS employees were complicit in the conspiracy, and said the bank wasn\u0027t \u0027knowingly turning a blind eye\u0027 to the con.THE FINANCIAL CRASHHBOS, once the UK\u0027s biggest mortgage lender, suffered a devastating collapse during the credit crunch - and taxpayers were left to foot the £20.5billion bill.The banking giant was formed by the 2001 merger of Halifax and The Bank of Scotland and loaned £435billion within seven years as it pursued an aggressive expansion plan.But it lost £10.8billion in 2008 as profits plunged by 70 per cent when the credit crunch hit.Gordon Brown\u0027s Labour government quickly issued a £20.5billion bailout package to fix HBOS\u0027s massive funding gap and avoid a \u0027banking meltdown\u0027.The Banking Standards Commission later slammed HBOS bosses for \u0027catastrophic failings\u0027 and a \u0027colossal failure of management\u0027.Former CEO James Crosby, the \u0027architect\u0027 of HBOS\u0027s failed strategy, forfeited the knighthood he was granted for \u0027services to the finance industry\u0027 after leaving the bank for a senior FSA role in 2006.Mr Crosby, thought to draw more than £400,000 a year from his HBOS pension, said he was \u0027deeply sorry\u0027 for the disaster.In 2012 HBOS senior executive Peter Cummings was fined £500,000 and banned from banking for life by the FSA for his part in the bank\u0027s near-collapse.Mr Cummings retired in 2009 with a £352,000 a year pension after making his name by lending to high-profile clients including Top Shop founder Philip Green.Lloyds Bank acquired HBOS in January 2009 as part of the rescue package.Amid the chaos, Lloyds instructed Deloitte to investigate Scourfield\u0027s activity after the Financial Services Authority (now the Financial Conduct Authority) issued a requirement notice.The criminal investigation didn\u0027t begin until after the report, dubbed Project Windsor, was completed in 2010.THE VICTIMSThe 2010 report revealed that of the £250million written off by HBOS\u0027s IA ision, £245million related to customers under Scourfield\u0027s management.Nearly all of them had engaged QCS\u0027s \u0027consultancy services\u0027.Businesses that fell prey to the criminal plot include golf equipment firm Seoul Nassau, fishing tackle company Sharpe\u0027s Holdings, aviation group Corporate Jet Services (who owned Club 328 and Euromanx), textile business Magenta, restaurant and nightclub operator the Mezzanine Group, and Remnant Media, a company setup to buy porn mags including Asian Babes.HBOS began legal action against some of the clients, including couple Paul and Nikki Turner, who ran Cambridge-based music publisher Zenith before it was destroyed by Scourfield\u0027s scam.The bank took the Turners to court more than 15 times in an unsuccessful attempt to evict them after Scourfield devastated their business.Oxfordshire farmer Justin Riggs, 57, said his livelihood was \u0027annihilated\u0027 when Scourfield authorised a £375,000 loan and advised him to sell land and chicken coops in 2004.The farmer was forced to remortgage his house when his loan rose by £7,000 after he had paid £231,000 in interest and fees.Mr Riggs\u0027 plight was discussed in parliament in 2009 as MP Ed Vaizey noted: \u0027There is a pattern in the way that Mr Scourfield engaged numerous people.\u0027He has taken businesses and loaded them with loans, charges and consultancy fees. It\u0027s now up to HBOS to come to the table.\u0027THE INVESTIGATIONThe six-year investigation, dubbed Operation Hornet, was \u0027the most complex and far-reaching\u0027 fraud case in Thames Valley Police\u0027s history, involving 120 officers.

Britons are predicted to spend £2.44billion in the Black Friday sales today, as shoppers battle it for cut-price TVs and electrical goods          People queue up at the HMV store before the opening during the Black Friday sales in Oxford Street in London this morning          There were some early-morning Black Friday shoppers battling for deals first thing today, as shown in Newcastle at a Tesco, shortly after it opened its doors at 5am  Online shoppers boasted on social media about the purchases they had made on Black Friday, during which Brits are expected to splurge £2.5billion           Shoppers in Birmingham enjoy the first of a four-day weekend in which retailers slash prices in a bid to tempt customers into spending ahead of Christmas          Bargain hunters who headed straight to the electronics aisle at Tesco in Newcastle this morning to buy an Xbox were left disappointed when it appeared only six games were on sale          A member of GMB, the union for Amazon workers, stages a protest  at the Amazon Swansea fulfillment centreMeanwhile, unions in Britain will stage protests at five sites to complain about safety conditions. Amazon said the safety record at its warehouses is above the industry average. Protests were also reported or due in France and Germany.While Black Friday discounts have traditionally been a U.S. retail event, companies have increasingly been offering discounts in other countries, too.          Members and supporters of the GMB union protest outside the Amazon offices  in Milton Keynes                                                    Some 42 per cent of Britons are looking forward to the event, and 22 per cent are specifically looking to buy Christmas presents - while 25 per cent are intending to shop on Cyber Monday, a survey by KPMG suggests.Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said: \u0027Retail performance throughout the year has been dreary to say the least, and we\u0027ve certainly had a shaky start to the all-important \u0027golden quarter\u0027. \u0027Retailers will naturally be keen to make the most of these events, and our survey would certainly suggest that consumers are gearing up for it.\u0027However, consumer group Which? said its over-arching message to shoppers this year was to not feel pressured into spending after finding that nine in 10 Black Friday deals last year were the same price or even cheaper at other times of the year.It has urged consumers to be careful not to buy on impulse and instead research products and prices before spending in the sale.Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: \u0027While retailers are bombarding us with promises of great discounts and time-limited sales, it\u0027s clear that not all deals are as good as they might appear.\u0027To bag a bargain, do your research and don\u0027t get carried away by the hype when shopping in the upcoming sales.\u0027Early indications suggest that Black Friday spending will dip for the first time this year since its arrival in the UK.Consumers will spend £2.4billion on deals in stores and online, down from last year\u0027s £2.6billion, according to the predictions from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) and VoucherCodes.co.uk.Analyst Springboard has also said footfall and spending activity over this year\u0027s Black Friday period is likely to be affected by economic pressures such as high debt levels and significant living costs, compounded by the event taking place a week earlier this year - before many consumers are paid for the month.According to KPMG\u0027s study, the promotional period is favoured by younger consumers, with 75 per cent of shoppers aged 18 to 24 saying they will be taking advantage of deals compared to 36 per cent of 45 to 54 year olds, and just 24 per cent of over 55s.Mr Martin added: \u0027Many shoppers are likely to recall how the slashed pricing in store resulted in stampedes, which is just not what mature consumers seek out.\u0027Since Black Friday was adopted by Britons back in 2013, retailers have increasingly moved offers online, and that coincidentally is where a higher proportion of younger consumers can be found.\u0027          People queue up outside Foot Locker before opening during the Black Friday sales in Oxford Street, London this morning            Early-morning risers queue outside Foot Locker in Birmingham\u0027s main shopping centre, the Bullring, which is set for an incredibly busy day          Shoppers are taking advantage of the annual Black Friday sales early this morning, with this couple pictured walking out of the Tesco Extra store in Gorton, Manchester          Thousands braved the near-freezing conditions overnight to queue outside stores up and down the country, including Tesco in Newcastle, to beat other shoppers to the biggest discounts          A shopper heads back home after a particularly early start this morning to pick up a new television from Tesco Extra in Gorton, Manchester          Stacked televisions are pictured ahead of doors opening at a Tesco in Newcastle. Britain\u0027s retailers are hoping Black Friday discounts will get shoppers spending again after a torrid year for much of the sector          Shoppers eagerly await entry to the Tesco Extra store in Gorton, Manchester. According to researcher Springboard, footfall on the main shopping streets is anticipated to drop versus 2017, while online transactions are forecast to rise          Some of the best deals had already sold out before much of the UK had even woken up this morning, with retailers starting their offers overnight (electronics retailer GAME was already sold out of its Nintendo Switch and two game deal this morning)          Bargain-hungry Brits leave a Tesco in Manchester with a new TV.

Twitter users snipe and despair at Black Friday madness as bargain hunters battle for deals online and in stores across UKSocial media is awash with memes, outrage and excitement today as Black Friday frenzy sweeps the UK.Shoppers up and down the country have been sent into a frenzy as they sharpen their elbows and scramble to snap up bargains.And they are taking to Twitter to flaunt their bargains and joke about their suffering bank balances amid millions being spend on the High Street and online.More than two fifths of Britons are planning to spend in the Black Friday sales today amid warnings not to \u0027get carried away by the hype\u0027.Some 42 per cent of Britons are looking forward to the event, and 22 per cent are specifically looking to buy Christmas presents - while 25 per cent are intending to shop on Cyber Monday, a survey by KPMG suggests.  Black Friday fever has swept the nation this morning, as bargain hunters sharpen their elbows to snap up discounted goods   Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said: \u0027Retail performance throughout the year has been dreary to say the least, and we\u0027ve certainly had a shaky start to the all-important \u0027golden quarter\u0027.\u0027Retailers will naturally be keen to make the most of these events, and our survey would certainly suggest that consumers are gearing up for it.\u0027However, consumer group Which? said its over-arching message to shoppers this year was to not feel pressured into spending after finding that nine in 10 Black Friday deals last year were the same price or even cheaper at other times of the year.It has urged consumers to be careful not to buy on impulse and instead research products and prices before spending in the sale.Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: \u0027While retailers are bombarding us with promises of great discounts and time-limited sales, it\u0027s clear that not all deals are as good as they might appear.\u0027To bag a bargain, do your research and don\u0027t get carried away by the hype when shopping in the upcoming sales.\u0027  Early indications suggest that Black Friday spending will dip for the first time this year since its arrival in the UK.Consumers will spend £2.4 billion on deals in stores and online, down from last year\u0027s £2.6 billion, according to the predictions from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) and VoucherCodes.co.uk.Analyst Springboard has also said footfall and spending activity over this year\u0027s Black Friday period is likely to be affected by economic pressures such as high debt levels and significant living costs, compounded by the event taking place a week earlier this year - before many consumers are paid for the month.According to KPMG\u0027s study, the promotional period is favoured by younger consumers, with 75 per cent of shoppers aged 18 to 24 saying they will be taking advantage of deals compared to 36 per cent of 45 to 54 year olds, and just 24 per cent of over 55s.Mr Martin added: \u0027Many shoppers are likely to recall how the slashed pricing in store resulted in stampedes, which is just not what mature consumers seek out.\u0027Since Black Friday was adopted by Britons back in 2013, retailers have increasingly moved offers online, and that coincidentally is where a higher proportion of younger consumers can be found.\u0027  Black Friday: Amazon reports \u0027record levels\u0027 of UK shopping"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/14/10/6167644-0-image-m-12_1542192238060.jpg","title":"Putins propagandist resident London 700 000 property Chiswick","story":"    Sergey Brilev, a top pro-Putin TV presenter, poses by Tower Bridge in London in 2017          Brilev, right, and his wife Irina Brileva, left, pose outside Warwick Castle in 2017          Mrs Brileva allegedly owns a £700,000 flat in this apartment block in Chiswick, west London\u0027Brilev\u0027s main propaganda weapon is the total replacement of reality,\u0027 alleged Navalny, seen in Russia as the strongman\u0027s most charismatic political foe.The presenter gives the impression that \u0027there is simply no bad news\u0027 about Putin, he said.When Novichok poisoners Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov were exposed as spies, Brilev ignored this development and instead ran a soft feature on the Duchess of Sussex, he said.Open sources in London show Brilev\u0027s charity worker wife Irina bought an apartment valued at £700,000 in 2016 without a mortgage in Heathfield Terrace, Chiswick.She is also linked to a managing company for this address.Cuban-born Brilev had formerly worked in Britain as a correspondent for Russian TV.

History professor and researcher Dr. Gary Mormino described the tunnels to DailyMail.com as, \u0027nothing too remarkable to look at,\u0027 flat on the bottom, and wide, making them unsuitable as a sewage system, and all the more interesting to those wondering why they exist\u0027At this point, I\u0027m looking at ruling things out,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m asking myself, What were the tunnels not used for?\u0027While some are quick to guess they may have been used to transport bootlegged alcohol during the 1920s and early 1930s, Mormino said that doesn\u0027t make any sense, either.\u0027I interviewed a lot of people in the 1970s and \u002780s who would have been involved in bootlegging of \u002720s and \u002730s and they\u0027ve all said the only people who feared the police were those who weren\u0027t involved in the rackets\u0027 he said. \u0027If you paid off the police, you were fine.\u0027     University of Southern Florida - St. Petersburg professor Emeritus of history Dr. Gary Mormino told DailyMail.com the tunnels (pictured) were likely part of a criminal network, and that Ybor City officials would have had to be in on the constructionMormino shared a story about one of his interview subjects named Sam, who said his father was an Italian bootlegger, who would receive a call once each month from the police telling him he had to come in and be arrested and pay his fines.Once there, Sam said the police would ask his father what name he wanted to be arrested under \u0027this time,\u0027 and the next day the front page of the newspaper would read, \u0027Seven Italian bootleggers arrested,\u0027 as part of a ruse intended to appease the public.In fact, Mormino said Sam also told him he used to deliver crates of bootlegged alcohol to shops and when the police were they, they would open the door and help him carry the boxes in, praising him for being such an enterprising young man. So, Mormino has determined, the tunnels probably weren\u0027t used for bootlegging. Instead, he said, it\u0027s far more likely they were used for \u0027white slavery related to bringing women across interstate lines for immoral purposes,\u0027 along with smuggling in Chinese laborers and Chinese-Cuban prostitutes.Mormino said Ybor City has had a large Chinese-Cuban population dating back to 1886.   \u0027Chinese people were brought to Cuba after slavery ended in late 19th century to replace slaves and work in the sugar industry,\u0027 Mormino said.The professor guessed that around that time, city of Tampa officials may have been in on creating the tunnels which would have otherwise been a massive and expensive undertaking for a criminal enterprise.          While some are quick to guess they may have been used to transport bootlegged alcohol during the 1920s and early 1930s, Mormino said that doesn\u0027t make any sense, because police were so \u0027in on it\u0027 that tunnels wouldn\u0027t have been necessary In this undated photo federal authorities are shown unearthing a buried whiskey cache in the backyard of a Ybor City homeMormino believes that local leaders may have extending the passages down to the port\u0027Basically, corrupt politics likely allowed the criminal elements to use those tunnels as part of a vast, interconnected network,\u0027 he said.  Man accused of killing his friend on Thanksgiving Day tells...AWOL California National Guardsman \u0027tried to smuggle three...Share this articleBut, Mormino made sure to mention, that while it\u0027s fun to guess about what may have gone on in those hidden passageways all those years ago, anything anyone has come up with is just a guess. \u0027I don\u0027t know if we\u0027ll ever know the truth, to be honest,\u0027 Mormino said. \u0027It\u0027s a rather elusive story now.

I simply cannot allow myself to be scared by — let alone believe in — the supernatural.But this isn’t the first time Rosalyn has spooked me. When she was 18 months old, I remember how she pointed to an outside cellar door and was adamant she could see sheep. I dismissed it at the time, but she kept shouting: ‘Look, Mummy, sheep, sheep!’ A few weeks later, we walked past again and she announced with a sad face: ‘Sheep gone now, Mummy.’Although aware our house is built on the site of old sheep farming cottages, I put it to the back of my mind. After all, Rosalyn was just grappling with the rudiments of speech she could have meant anything.          Rosalyn outside her home in north Devon where she claims to have seen ghostsBut now she’s three, and much more articulate and focused. And she continues to tell me about Tilly and Alex. No wonder I have started to feel unsettled in our home of three years. Although I don’t believe in ghosts, I would be lying if I said the idea of them didn’t scare me. There is so much in life we don’t understand, so much we don’t know, and there are so many accounts of people saying they’ve seen things they cannot rationally explain.I decided to do some digging, in an effort to convince myself that there is nothing to Rosalyn’s imaginings.I wish I hadn’t.Census records for 1861 show there was a ten-year-old boy called Alexander Turner living here. And records for 30 years later, in 1891, list a Matilda Oke, aged 20. Records are patchy from this time, so it’s very likely that Matilda was living here when she was much younger.Although I am struggling to convince myself that Alex, Tilly and the visiting flock of sheep are nothing more than the creation of a toddler’s vivid imagination, a recent study reveals that one in five Britons claims to have experienced the presence of a ghost.I did some research and discovered that there are many rational parents in the same position as me — with children like the little boy, played by Haley Joel Osment, in the film The Sixth Sense — who say they ‘see dead people’.Take mother-of-six Katie Jones, 33, a carer from Canterbury, Kent. She has an 11-year-old daughter Alice, who, from the age of two, has spoken of seeing people who are no longer here. Katie, who is married to landlord Gareth, 47, explains: ‘When Alice was two, she started to cry a lot, saying there were two men in her room staring and shouting at her, and she didn’t like it.‘She then started to say that a girl called Sheila sat at the bottom of her bed crying for her mummy. I looked in old newspaper cuttings and found that there was a girl of that name murdered here. It chilled me to the core.‘Alice then told me that my grandmother, also named Alice, who died a year before my daughter was born, was coming into her bedroom. She said that Nanna had told the girl and the men to go away, and they had.’Katie says Alice would accurately describe the clothes her grandmother wore, something she couldn’t have known.‘When Alice was three, a family member had a stillborn baby. Alice told me that Nanna had been to see her with a baby in her arms. She said the baby was named Max. There is no way she could’ve known this. We hadn’t told her about the baby or his name — she was too little to understand.‘As the years have passed, she still says Max and Nanna are there. She even told me it was Max’s fourth birthday and, when I checked, she was right. She had the correct day and age.’Katie continues: ‘When she was four, I remember her telling me that she had to give our next-door neighbour a message. Her husband had just died of cancer and she wanted to tell her to stop crying as he had told her he was fine.‘When she first started saying things, I brushed it off as the chatter of a little girl, but the more it happened the more I came to realise she was telling the truth. Now I have no doubt she has a gift.‘She has always felt comforted by her Nanna, but there have been some bad experiences. In our old house, she kept saying she saw a boy and she’d refuse to go upstairs. She’d stand there screaming, saying the boy wouldn’t let her go past. It used to really scare me.’Now aged 11, Alice says that she’s seeing things less and less, but can clearly remember seeing her great-grandmother. ‘I always felt safe with my Nanna there, and I remember seeing the baby, too. I also remember it being his birthday.‘I only feel scared when it’s someone I don’t know, but I see them less now. To any other children who see things like this, I would say you don’t have to be scared, as they are just looking out for you and trying to protect you.’          Tricia Jordan pictured with her son Luca, sevenDr Stephen Westgarth, a member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, a consultant child psychiatrist and medical director of Child Psychiatry UK, says such behaviour is normal for a young child.‘Children’s imaginative worlds are limitless, and don’t contain the same social and physical rules of the adult world.‘As a parent, I wouldn’t be worried about a child experiencing these episodes and, in some ways, it can be viewed as very positive, because it shows that they have a vivid and well-defined imagination.‘The normal situation would be that, as the child grows and the brain develops, they begin to rationalise what they are experiencing and so the episodes will begin to wane.’He says he has dealt with families who say their children are talking to ‘the beyond’, but says these tended to be spiritualists and strong believers in the afterlife, so there was a culture there already.Yet, like me, mother-of-two Tricia Jordan is not clairvoyant, but she is in no doubt that her son talks to the dead.The 32-year-old medical secretary says her seven-year-old son, Luca, has been ‘seeing’ her dead grandmother since he was a baby, which used to scare her, but she now feels comforted by it.Tricia, from Newport, Gwent, who is married to postman Stuart, 37, and also has a four-year-old son, Bobby, says: ‘My grandmother passed away when Luca was 18 months old. He had just started to speak, and the first thing he told me was how Granny would tuck him up in bed. I found it really strange. It used to scare me, and I’d change the subject.‘One of the eeriest things was him singing The Big Ship Sails On The Ally-Ally-O, which she always sang to me. He would sing it over and over, and tell me how Granny was there. I had never sung it to him. There is no way he could have known this song.‘As time went on, I realised he wasn’t scared so it was all right.’She describes another encounter when he was four: ‘One day, we passed a house near our home. He told me it was Martin’s house but he wasn’t there because he died in a fire. I checked the names on a census and a Martin had lived there. This really scared me.’Luca hasn’t had any spooky sightings for some years, and today he has no memory of seeing his dead grandmother.Tricia says that, while she has always believed in an afterlife, what she has experienced with her son has left her utterly convinced that the dead walk among us.She says: ‘I have always believed a little bit, but what I have seen with Luca blew my mind. It made me believe completely.’          Six-year-old Riley has talked to people his mother Hollie could not seeHollie Smith from New Addington, South London, also shares this conviction. She is certain her six-year-old son, Riley, has seen ghosts. The 32-year-old, who runs a party business with husband Colin, 40, says he has experienced too many things to leave her in any doubt as to their validity.She says: ‘When he was two, we were out walking when he started pointing and waving, saying, “Look, Mummy, there’s a soldier, he’s waving at us.” There was no one there. He was so excited and animated. He then looked so disappointed when he told me the soldier had gone. I believed him. He was too little to make something like that up.‘Surprisingly, I didn’t feel scared. I almost felt like it was a precious experience that someone from another life wanted to say hello.’Hollie also recalls another instance when Riley was around 18 months old. ‘I walked into his bedroom and he was having a conversation with someone. His language was limited, but he was talking and answering and gesturing with someone who wasn’t there.‘I asked him who it was. He said it was Humpty. He kept on telling me for days afterwards that Humpty was there. At the time, our neighbour had just died, a man who was very overweight. I had never sung this nursery rhyme to Riley. Maybe he’d picked it up elsewhere, but I think he was talking to our neighbour.’Riley also had an imaginary friend at pre-school called George, who was so real to him that he was the only child he played with. She adds: ‘Yes, it could be nothing more than an imaginary friend, but in the context of these other things, I’m not so sure.Celebrity psychic Honor Broxap believes such sightings should not be dismissed. ‘We are all born with a sixth sense,’ she says. ‘Yet we stop using it as we get older. Children are much more believing, less questioning or cynical. They have not yet been conditioned to think that it’s all just nonsense.          Alice, 11, said she has seen a number of ghosts from the age of three‘You have to be careful that you don’t over-exaggerate it. Yes, children do have a vivid imagination, but more often than not, there is some truth in it.’Clairvoyant medium and psychic artist Jackie Dennison agrees: ‘Children have imaginary friends. Maybe, it is just that, but perhaps it is sometimes more. They are very open to spirits and are unfazed by them. They take things in their stride. I believe we can also see layers of time, memories and echoes of what was once there.’Jackie says that this might explain the sheep in my cellar, and, with regards to Tilly and Alex, she tells me not to worry about them: ‘I think the fact that they’re in your home is quite amazing. They are obviously happy that you’re living there as a family.’Although I don’t share this sense of wonderment, I’m starting to feel a touch more at ease as to whatever is going on in my home. Rosalyn is happy, and also very young. I’m sure, like Luca and Riley, these stories will start to tail off as her real world expands, and she won’t remember much of what she tells me now.Yet, although I’ve tried to dismiss it and laugh it off, there is a growing part of me that is no longer fully convinced that we’re entirely alone in our home."},{"url":null,"title":"Teachers given wellbeing days Christmas shopping","story":"Boy, 13, who has cancer is forced to sit alone in class...Cleaning lady is jailed for ten years in Greece for claiming...Share this article‘This is a way for me to say thank you to staff for going above and beyond what is asked of them day in, day out, such as spending a weekend away on a residential trip or staying at school to help run a movie night for the children to enjoy.’ He personally covers the teachers on their days off, with other non-teaching roles also covered internally within the school.‘As a result, no teaching time is lost for any child and there is no disruption to the day-to-day running of the school,’ Mr Hulme said.

For all teachers and teaching assistants.’Teacher Naomi Takeda said: ‘We have a wellbeing week in December which culminates in a day off on the Friday for all staff and students to reconnect with family and friends.’ A teacher at Langshott Primary School in Horley, Surrey, also said they get a half day for Christmas shopping – but later deleted the comment.However, Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, believes the initiative is an ‘indulgence that schools cannot afford to do’.The measure was ‘another example of staff setting a poor example’ at a time when ‘we’re fining parents who take their children out during term time on holiday,’ the former head said.More than 9,000 parents in Kent have been fined for taking their children out of school during term over the last four years – one of the highest rates in the country.Mr McGovern added: ‘It sets a terrible example to people and I’m afraid it means that teachers are going to be “de-professionalised” and no one is going to take them seriously if this is what they’re doing. They should be putting the education of children first.‘If teachers want to be respected, they need to set an example by turning up for the job and doing it well.

James Reeve accuses Georgie of going back on her promise to terminate the unexpected pregnancy and of lying about taking the contraceptive pill          Divorcee Henrietta Reeve, 62, became the subject of a church investigation after Georgie’s priest, the Rector at St Luke’s in Chelsea, wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln saying she came under great pressure from the Reeve family — ‘Mrs Reeve in particular’ — to have an abortion‘It’s for Henry’s sake that I’m speaking out about this,’ says Georgie, cradling her son.‘He wasn’t planned, but the fact is that we have a beautiful baby boy and he deserves to have the best chance in life. I am struggling to cope financially, and I just want James to accept some responsibility for his son.’James Reeve sees things rather differently. A letter sent to Georgie by his solicitor says: ‘You entered a relationship with him which was meant to be entirely casual, with no commitment at all.’Meanwhile, Georgie has been receiving emotional support from a most unlikely quarter — James’s elder brother, William, who is heir to the family estate. He has not only been to visit his nephew but also became his godfather when Henry was christened in September.He hit the news himself this week after he collapsed in court as he launched a battle with his mother over the future of their family’s 230-year-old country estate.Old Etonian William, 38, says the future of the 18th-century Leadenham estate is at risk due to a bitter family row, not helped by the situation between James and Georgie.Meanwhile, Georgie remains hurt and angry at the way she has been treated. While she doesn’t deny the relationship was casual at first, she argues that she and James began to see each other regularly — at least every week — and their romance became more than just physical.‘We used to take my dog for walks together and go out for long lunches and dinners. Or I cooked for us here. Sometimes we used to get a takeaway and a bottle of wine and just lie in front of the television. He brought flowers. We became close. It started to feel more serious. We opened up to each other about our lives.’And what different lives they are.Georgie, the daughter of a Pakistani-born father and British mother, was raised in a terrace house in South-east London and attended an all-girls’ state school. She studied media at the University of Buckingham, but left before finishing her degree and worked as a VIP nightclub hostess at Chinawhite in Soho.In her early 20s, she began work as a secretary at a barristers’ chambers in central London, moved to Chelsea and joined a ladies’ shooting club in West London.James, meanwhile, is one of four children born to Peter and Henrietta Reeve, and grew up enjoying all the privileges that life in a family with a lineage stretching back to Edward III can offer — including 20-bedroom Grade II-listed Leadenham House on the family’s 3,000-acre estate. He attended Eton and after university, returned to the estate to pursue his love of polo.          Despite living at Leadenham House James Reeve has been assessed as unable to make child maintenance payments           Mr Reeve (pictured), the son of Lincoln Cathedral\u0027s lay Canon who is accused of encouraging Miss David to have an abortionAn un-brie-lievable new home: Former cheese factory on a...\u0027There\u0027s no excuse for what he did\u0027: Victim\u0027s verdict after...Female former USA gymnastics trainer who worked with...Pedophile doctor Larry Nassar is transferred to notorious...Share this articleGeorgie insists she is no gold-digger and had no idea just how wealthy James was when she met him. ‘He’s actually quite scruffy,’ she says. ‘I bought him socks on two occasions because his had holes in.’Claims that she tricked him into getting her pregnant are rebutted.‘The accusation that I lied about being on the Pill or that I deliberately didn’t take it is ridiculous. The only person who can possibly know if I took it is me, and I know I took it.’Nevertheless, in June 2017 a home test revealed she was pregnant. At first, she says, James took the news calmly. He travelled from Lincolnshire and the pair attended an NHS clinic in North London offering pregnancy counselling and abortion services.She admits that at this stage, she was ready to consider a termination. ‘I was only five weeks pregnant and it seemed the sensible thing to do,’ she explains. But before they had the chance to discuss it, medical events swiftly overtook them.This dramatically impacted her feelings about the pregnancy.First, a scan suggested Georgie was suffering from an ectopic pregnancy — a potentially fatal condition. She was sent to A\u0026ampE at the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, where she was monitored until it became clear the pregnancy was not ectopic and she was suffering from a harmless cyst in her fallopian tube.‘It was a very stressful situation because it could have impacted my future fertility,’ she says. ‘James was wonderful, perfect in every way. He cuddled me and reassured me.’When she was discharged three days later, she returned home to find he had cleaned her flat and put fresh flowers in a vase.Soon after, they returned to the pregnancy advice clinic, again planning to speak to a counsellor about the possibility of a termination, but after another scan, Georgie was told she had suffered a ‘missed miscarriage’ — where an embryo dies but is not immediately expelled by the body. Medical advice for women suffering the condition in the first three months of pregnancy is to allow nature to take its course.Given that both she and James believed the pregnancy was over, she says, there was no longer any need to discuss a termination. Instead, they went away for a weekend to help her get over the ordeal, staying at the Victoria Inn hotel in Holkham, Norfolk.‘He was really lovely to me at that time,’ she says.But at a check-up at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in August 2017, Georgie was given the jaw-dropping news that she hadn’t miscarried at all. She was 13 weeks pregnant with a healthy baby.‘It was the last thing I expected,’ she says. ‘I could see a heartbeat. I was overwhelmed that after everything that had happened, here was a perfect little baby.’She phoned James to break the news. ‘He was completely shocked,’ she says. ‘I asked if he wanted to see the scan photos and he said that he didn’t, that it was too much for him to take in. He said he needed to speak to his mother.‘I understood that he was overwhelmed.’She claims she then had a call from Mrs Reeve. ‘During the conversation, she said James wouldn’t stand by me. She said that I should be aware that he wouldn’t be inheriting anything. There was no reasoning with her. She upset me so much that I hung up.’After that, she says, she and James maintained contact by phone but relations between them were ‘not the same as before. He wanted me to have an abortion but after everything that had happened and then seeing the scan, I felt very differently. I felt very pressurised by him and his family’The last time she saw James was at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Georgie says it became clear he still expected her to terminate the pregnancy.‘He kept coming in and out of the room on his phone and then he just disappeared and didn’t come back. That was the last time I saw him. It was such a brutal way to be left.’When Georgie wrote to James, telling him she had to ‘decide what’s best for our baby’, she received an email from his solicitor telling her: ‘He does not wish to have any contact with you now or in the future. However, he remains willing to support you financially with the previous plan to have a termination. Any financial payment would need to be through me.’Further strongly worded legal letters followed. One sent in October 2017 reads: ‘Frankly, our client feels that he was entrapped by you . . . Our client has only ever wanted to have children in the context of a loving, stable and long-term relationship and clearly that was not the nature of the relationship he had with you. Our client has no intention of having any involvement with your child.’    James Reeve has claimed he is a victim of \u0027entrapment\u0027 who is not paid enough to make child maintenance payments Extraordinarily, a solicitor’s letter was even sent to Georgie’s widowed mother stating: ‘Reports through third parties have led our client to be concerned for Georgie’s mental state.’It continued: ‘He felt that it was necessary to put on record his own position so that you know how best to help her.’ Henry was born on March 5, 2018 and Georgie texted James to say he was welcome to visit at the hospital, but she received no response. Requests to meet via a legal mediation service were also rejected.After she turned to the Government’s Child Maintenance Service, James complied with instructions to pay her £407.71. According to his solicitor, a further review by the CMS showed ‘he lacked a current salary and was only in receipt of a modest income from his family’. The CMS does not consider assets, but the Department for Work and Pensions, which oversees the service, is monitoring the case.And it is clear that Georgie is not going to go away quietly. When the Rector of St Luke’s wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln in August, he asked for an investigation into the ‘pastorally unacceptable situation which has clear safeguarding implications’.Writing back a month later, the Bishop of Grantham said an investigation had concluded ‘this is not a safeguarding matter’.

Miss David claims she was made pregnant by James Reeve - polo-playing Old Etonian son of Lincoln Cathedral\u0027s lay Canon          Miss David met Mr Reeve in 2017 and the pair quickly began dating but she fell pregnant In the letter, copies of which were sent to both Georgie and Mrs Reeve, he added that: ‘Mrs Reeve does not deny the existence of Henry, though she has no relationship with him and does not want one,’ and said discussions had been held with Mrs Reeve ‘about how she might pray for Henry and perhaps in some future time be able to relate to him in some way that honours Mr Reeve and him.’Georgie says she would like the Reeve family to be involved in Henry’s life. For now, the only member of the Reeve family to have met the baby is his uncle William.‘He’s a really sweet chap and I worry about his future because this is absolutely no way to begin life,’ William told the Mail. ‘Everyone needs to focus on putting this behind them.’William’s support for Georgie may have been influenced by a furious row within the Reeve family itself about the future of its estate. Leadenham has been passed down through generations since the 18th century, but was partitioned after Mrs Reeve orced Peter in 2011.If his uncle is successful, the future for baby Henry may yet prove to be rosy.Georgie insists: ‘I never expected — or wanted — James to marry me.’ She adds: ‘I just want him to do the right thing by Henry. What’s happened has happened, and I’m sure James would be amazing at fatherhood if he just gave it a chance.’Mrs Reeve and James both refused to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"Sick mythical looking Harry Potter creature revealed raccoon","story":"    This unusual hairless creature found in Florida on Friday was revealed to be a severely ill raccoon that passed away on Wednesday          Back To Nature Wildlife Refuge in Orange County said she was likely battling alopecia or a genetic mutation she was born withThe rescue service said she was likely battling alopecia or a genetic mutation she was born with. \u0027We know you are all anxious to hear news about our sweet girl... and though we chose to remain hopeful and diligent with her care and condition, we sincerely regret to inform you that she passed away late last night, in her sleep,\u0027 the Facebook post said.\u0027We couldn’t be more grateful for the chance to try to save her.

Gulp!At least 80 Tory MPs are openly hostile and could vote against the deal. So too could Ulster’s Democratic Unionist Party MPs, who are supposedly in alliance with the Government to provide the Tories with a Commons majority.In other words, the arithmetic looks dire. It seems almost certain that MPs will snub Mrs May, and her Brexit package will crash and burn.What happens then?Anyone who thinks they know is a fool. However, it is possible to set out some of the possible scenarios.First, assuming that Mrs May loses the vote, she could risk all by resigning her government.Banksy paintings worth £13million seized by Belgian police...Black Friday bargain hunters FIGHT for the best deals on the...Share this articleThis would mean the Queen would ask Jeremy Corbyn, as leader of the Opposition, to try to form a government himself. If he failed to command a Commons majority — the most likely outcome — a General Election would have to be held.True, Mrs May has rejected the idea of a third General Election in as many years — undoubtedly a wise move after her miscal-culation of going to country in June last year.Alternatively, Mrs May could simply resign as Tory leader — and hang on forlornly as a lame duck Prime Minister while her party elects a replacement.Contemptuously, hardline Brexiteers claim it doesn’t matter either way whether Mrs May stays or goes. They say that if she loses next month’s Commons vote, then Britain would automatically leave the EU regardless, and without a deal, on March 29 next year.          The Prime Minister is not out of jail yet as she still needs to get the deal through parliamentRemainer MPs disagree. Optimistically, they believe that MPs from all the main parties will come together to prevent a no-deal exit from the EU.Under this scenario, it would mean Downing Street — whether Mrs May is Prime Minister or not — losing control of events.A swaggeringly self-confident Parliament would take over decision-making.It is important to note that more than 70 per cent of MPs are believed to have voted Remain in the EU referendum and that, crucially, the Commons has a fervently pro-EU Speaker in the shape of John Bercow.          Jacob Rees-Mogg has made his thoughts on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan clear after he handed in a letter of no confidence in the Prime MinisterMake no mistake: Bercow will try to manipulate events in a pro-European direction.Meanwhile, as Westminster descended into chaos, it would be only a matter of time before political uncertainly translated into financial and economic chaos.There would be a huge risk of a recession with the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.It should not be forgotten that while MPs are playing their political games, the livelihoods of the British people are at risk.This sobering thought leads me to believe that Mrs May’s position is much stronger than it looks.Most decent folk think she is doing her best in desperately difficult circumstances. They feel disgust at what they see — rightly or wrongly — as cynical manoeuvring by devious and calculating politicians only interested in furthering their own Westminster careers.That is why Mrs May was surely right this week to appeal over the heads of Parliament to the British people in a series of TV appearances and radio interviews.Thus far, this strategy is working, with polls showing that the PM is much more popular than any rivals for her job.The fact is that Houdini May has survived numerous desperate scrapes.Repeatedly, her enemies and even some colleagues have plotted to destroy her. Ill-informed commentators have forecast her downfall. Yet each time she’s survived.Up until now, I have been one of the few to predict her survival. But now, I can’t confidently forecast that Mrs May and her deal will make it through the next few tempestuous weeks.But, as a betting man, I do still believe she’s favourite to make it.Of course, her EU exit deal isn’t perfect. But it’s the best available. No one has yet come up with a better idea — at any rate not one which would work.Meanwhile, her allies are making it clear to hardcore Brexiteers, on one side, that the alternative to her strategy is Britain remaining in the EU.On the other hand, to Europhiles, they claim the alternative is a no-deal Brexit and all the perils that would entail.This is a clever two-pronged weapon and so far it’s worked.What’s more, Mrs May has successfully employed a tactic of which, quite frankly, I had not considered her capable.She’s split the Brexiteers.There have been Cabinet resignations — by Boris Johnson, David Davis, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey — but their erstwhile Brexiteer colleagues including Andrea Leadsom, Michael Gove and Penny Mordaunt have stayed onboard.          Boris Johnson is one of the most high profile Cabinet ministers to have resigned over BrexitThe repercussions of what happens over the coming weeks are much more significant for Britain than those after the Suez Crisis of 1956, when prime minister Anthony Eden resigned. They are much, much more crucial.At heart, the Suez Crisis was about Britain coming to terms with the loss of empire.Brexit is about how we survive as an independent nation in a hostile world outside a powerful bloc of European countries.The poet Hilaire Belloc warned a century ago in his Cautionary Verses For Children: ‘Always keep a-hold of nurse — For fear of finding something worse!’As Theresa May leads us out of the EU, his advice is more vital than ever.  Tory blunder on our precious voting systemThe Electoral Commission is an independent body whose duty it is to ‘oversee elections and regulate political finance’.In view of this responsibility, it worries me that Tory peer Lord Gilbert has been appointed a board member.In the past, I have highlighted Stephen Gilbert’s controversial role as a Tory party campaign chief at a time when disturbing evidence came to light that the Tories had disregarded electoral law by overspending, during a series of by-elections in 2014 when they feared losing to Ukip. Following a brilliant investigation by Channel 4’s Michael Crick, there were even fears that officials compounded the offence by submitting at the very least misleading election returns to returning officers — a criminal offence punishable by jail.I repeatedly tried to approach Lord Gilbert for an explanation of apparent discrepancies in Tory spending. He never came back to me. Eventually, there were no criminal charges and I am sure Lord Gilbert’s actions were totally above board.Earlier this year, the Commission itself was heavily criticised after some senior members voiced opposition to Brexit.There was concern that commissioners had infringed the body’s code of conduct, which requires them to act ‘at all times’ to ‘uphold its impartiality’.With this latest development, putting Lord Gilbert forward to work at the Commission, the Tory Party has sent out a most unfortunate message about its respect for a deeply sensitive role which goes right to the heart of the integrity of the British political process.  One minister keeps gallantly riding to the support of Mrs May.Prisons minister Rory Stewart has been ever-present in TV studios, explaining with characteristic courtesy the benefits of the PM’s deal with Brussels.Mr Stewart is the opposite of those identikit politicians with scant knowledge of life outside Westminster.

Instead of pursuing visions of perfection, we value what works.Extracting ourselves from the European Union while maintaining our friendship with its members amounts to one of the most complicated tasks imaginable.I believe that the Declaration on our future relationship with the EU, agreed by the Government and the European Commission this week, stands in the best traditions of British pragmatism and ambition.We have not got everything we wanted and nor have they: Countless hours of painstaking negotiation have inevitably produced compromises on both sides. Yet if anyone still questions the resolve of this Government or this Prime Minister to honour the result of the Brexit referendum, then the Declaration should lay those doubts to rest.In the words of paragraph 4, our new relationship with the EU after Brexit will be based on ‘respecting the result of the 2016 referendum’ and the ‘sovereignty of the United Kingdom’. The British people voted to take back control of our borders, laws and money – and this Declaration fulfils those instructions, while also striking the balance that will protect jobs and the integrity of our United Kingdom.The automatic right of any EU citizen to live and work in the UK will come to an end. We will be able to admit people with the skills to contribute to our economy, regardless of their national background.There is no need to worry about holidays or routine trips. The Declaration preserves visa-free travel across the EU for short-term visits. And the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and of Britons residing in the EU are fully protected. How Theresa May can pull a Houdini and survive the next few...May refuses THREE times to say whether she will quit if she...Share this articleThe Declaration will end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. Our laws will be made in our Parliament and interpreted by our courts. Britain will stop making vast annual payments to the EU, allowing us to exercise full control over public-spending priorities. This Government’s priority back home is the NHS. By 2023, we will be investing an extra £394million in the NHS every week. Having campaigned hard for this money, now we must ensure it is delivered.We have agreed to create a free-trade area with the EU without tariffs, quotas or charges, and Britain will regain the ability to seek free-trade deals around the world, a power we have not had since we joined the Common Market in 1973. The Declaration recognises how the UK will now develop an ‘independent trade policy’.          In a BBC phone in today, Mrs May warned that EU is not \u0027going to give us a better deal\u0027 if MPs vote down her settlementIt also makes clear that in foreign policy and security, we will continue to ‘combine efforts’ with the EU. But the reason why the course set by the Prime Minister is the best one for Britain does not just depend on the precise wording of the Declaration. It depends on our national duty, at this crucial moment, to keep our eyes on the main prize.Just over two years ago, 17.4million people voted to leave the EU, more than for any other cause or party in British history.If Parliament were to reject the Declaration and the proposed Withdrawal Agreement, this would open the door for those who wish to derail Brexit and overturn the result of the referendum.          The Prime Minister today mounted another staunch defence of the settlement she has thrashed out with Brussels, saying it is the \u0027right\u0027 one for the countryAlready we hear demands for the British people to be made to rerun the debate and vote again. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour just play politics – standing both for and against a second referendum, saying one thing to Leave voters and quite another to Remainers.As it happens, I voted to stay in the EU, but I respect the outcome and I believe in the democratic imperative of honouring the decision of the British people.Today, the choice is not between this Declaration and a perfect agreement. The real choice is between the terms secured by the Prime Minister in the national interest or the danger of going back to square one and Brexit not happening at all. This would deal a profoundly damaging blow to British democracy.Now that the crucial hour is upon us, the country should get behind her. "},{"url":null,"title":"PLATELLS PEOPLE Fiona Bruce doesnt cunning command Question Time bear pit","story":"    BBC newsreader and Antiques Roadshow presenter Fiona Bruce, who has reportedly been offered the job of hosting Question TimeAs the presenter of the Antiques Roadshow, Fiona Bruce should be able to differentiate between a priceless chalice and a poisoned one.One of the most eloquent, intelligent and gracious faces on TV, she has been offered the job of presenting Question Time, taking over from David Dimbleby who has held the chair for nearly a quarter of a century.My advice?

Palin’s account is full of wit and sympathyIf there’s one thing the British love more than a hero, it’s a heroic failure. Few iniduals fit this category better than the 19th-century polar explorer Sir John Franklin. If his memorial in London’s Waterloo Place is to be believed, he cut an impressive figure: firm-jawed and barrel-chested, his statue gazes towards the horizon as if searching for new worlds to conquer. The reality was very different.A podgy, balding Royal Navy officer, by the age of 40 he had already achieved an unenviable kind of fame, after he led an overland expedition to chart the north coast of Canada, during which half his men starved to death and Franklin himself earned the nickname The Man Who Ate His Boots. But it wasn’t until he led another Arctic expedition in 1845, this time to find the fabled Northwest Passage, that Franklin truly became a household name, although again this was because of what he had failed to do rather than what he had done.Several years after he should have returned, a search party stumbled across a sad trail of relics in the snow, including a chronometer, four teaspoons, and a copy of Oliver Goldsmith’s The Vicar of Wakefield, together with some human bones that had been gnawed on by human teeth. What had begun as a voyage into the icy unknown had apparently turned into a real-life Heart of Darkness. Despite angry protestations from such influential figures as Charles Dickens, and a determined one-woman campaign by his widow Lady Jane, it looked suspiciously as if Franklin (or one of his crew) had become The Man Who Ate His Men.Although the story of this disastrous voyage has often been told, two things distinguish Michael Palin’s revisiting of it. The first is that he’s Michael Palin, which means that his narrative is driven by a deep sympathy for explorers and adventurers, while also being illuminated by flashes of gentle wit. (Whales are so reluctant to hurry, he points out, that their lives appear to be like “the human equivalent of taking very long baths”.) The second is that he has plenty of new material to draw on, the most important of which was the discovery of Franklin’s ship HMS Erebus by a Canadian underwater archaeology team in 2014. Lost for almost 170 years, it lay virtually intact on the Arctic seabed, swaddled by strands of kelp and preserved by the ice like a giant ship in a bottle. In classical mythology, Erebus usually referred to the depths of the Underworld, and the ship that bore this name had certainly found a suitable resting place for itself.But before Franklin took it on its final voyage, Erebus had spent several years successfully exploring other equally bleak parts of the planet, and it is this previous life that forms the first two-thirds of Palin’s book. It’s a fascinating story that he brings full-bloodedly to life, stripping away the barnacles of the past to reveal the hidden history of a ship that spent years encountering places such as Cape Disappointment, Delusion Point and Exasperation Bay.Commissioned in 1823, the 372-ton Erebus was one of the last warships known as bomb vessels. Designed to fling shells high over coastal defences, they are referred to in “The Star-Spangled Banner”, where “the bombs bursting in air” alludes to the fire from British bomb ships. A tough, squat vessel, she spent a couple of years patrolling the Mediterranean as a visible reminder that Britannia ruled the waves. But it wasn’t until she was converted from a warship to an ice-ship that Erebus acquired a distinct identity. Her hull was strengthened with six-inch oak planking, and extra thick copper sheeting was used to cover the bow from waterline to keel. Under the command of the dashing Captain John Ross, the crew of the Erebus then spent the next four years voyaging further south than anyone had ever been before.As Palin notes, they were “polar pioneers”, at one time even sighting the Antarctic continent itself: a barren white landscape that looked like a huge sheet of paper waiting for someone to write on it. Then came the more complicated mission of finding a way through the Arctic’s moving jigsaw puzzle of ice, which Ross declined and Franklin eagerly accepted. The main challenge with this sort of biography is that it’s hard to make life at sea sound interesting. A captain who ran a tight ship in the 19th century was thought to be one who kept his men busy with regular daily routines, occasionally punctuated by bursts of official violence when a sailor was thought to deserve a flogging. Even so Palin teases out some good stories, such as Ross and his men spending New Year’s Day 1842 dancing in an “ice-ballroom” they had created, where “ice-creams were handed round”, followed by “a sort of slapstick Antarctic Olympics”, where they attempted to climb greasy poles and catch greased pigs.Palin also has a good understanding of the personalities involved, such as the ship’s surgeon and naturalist Robert McCormick, who had previously been on the Beagle with Charles Darwin, and claimed to be “a lover of the feathered race” despite taking every opportunity to blaze away at them before (no doubt lovingly) stuffing their carcasses. Like Franklin himself, such figures were obviously deeply flawed – gods with feet of slush – but Palin deals with them tactfully and kindly, recognising that it is precisely their failure to live up to their own heroic ideals that makes them so interesting to modern readers.Just across the road from the Franklin statue in Waterloo Place is a memorial to Captain Scott, who was beaten to the South Pole by Roald Amundsen. A few years earlier Amundsen was also the first man to cross the Northwest Passage by sea. And as Palin points out: “He has no memorial in London.”• Erebus is published by Random House.

Last week the acclaimed novelist and, to many, human embodiment of white male privilege published his 10 rules for aspiring novelists and, as tends to happen any time Franzen dares to open his mouth, he was thanked for his trouble with derision.Small sidenote here, but I really don’t get the Franzen loathing. Sure, he could lighten up on the constant talk about birdwatching, but otherwise the things Franzen is hated for are either not really hateworthy or not actually his fault. This all began in ye olden times of 2001 with the famous, nay, legendary saga of Oprah Winfrey choosing Franzen’s novel, The Corrections, for her book club and him saying he’d rather not, thanks. Winfrey’s book choices were often, he said, not incorrectly, “schmaltzy”. It was the snub heard around the world and Franzen was for ever cast as an elitist snob, his every pronouncement since (he hates social media! He likes nature!) taken as further evidence of his hatefulness, even though surely most people would love to live a nice, Twitter-free, nature-based life in California, as Franzen does.A more credible argument against him, made by the novelist Jodi Picoult and others, is that he gets the kind of critical adulation denied to female writers, but I’m not really sure what Franzen is supposed to do about that. Increasingly, it feels like Franzen is a scapegoat for white guilt, a white liberal even other white liberals can hate, so they feel less bad about themselves. He would have had to have been invented if he didn’t exist. Fortunately, he does exist, but no one seems very grateful for it.So, predictably, people hated Franzen’s rules for writing, which mixed the benignly helpful (avoid the internet and fancy verbs) with the unexpectedly koan-esque (“You have to love before you can be relentless.”) Interestingly, most of the hatred came from other writers, such as novelist Tessa Dare, who tweeted, “In which Jonathan Franzen reveals himself to be that guy who mentions Ayn Rand in his Tinder profile.” But as writing rules go, I’ve read a lot worse, and so I think we can conclude that the anger here isn’t really about the rules, but about Franzen, and even that isn’t really about Franzen, either.I read writers’ writing tips all the time, not because I think they’ll magically make me into as good a writer as, say, Tolstoy (“The best thoughts most often come in the morning after waking while still in bed”) or Hemingway (“Always stop while you are going good and don’t worry about it until you start to write the next day”), but because I’m nosy and these tips invariably say a lot more about the author than they do about writing (Tolstoy knew the value of staying in bed Hemingway was a machismo-riddled bolter who left writing sessions as casually as he left wives).The popularity of writing tips suggests a lot of people see fiction as a hobby anyone could knock off if they just knew the right tricks, as opposed to a job and a skill, and one requiring a serious amount of unique talent (although if Franzen said this, I honestly think he’d be pushed out into the Pacific Ocean on an ice floe).Teachers and plumbers aren’t asked for their top 10 tips on how to do their job. Even acting – the only profession seen as more self-indulgent than writing – doesn’t sell this fallacy no one’s asking Meryl Streep for her tips on how to play a bereaved mother, or Robert De Niro for his top 10 techniques for playing a mafia boss.

HSBC was not able to confirm how many customers were affected.“We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused,” the bank said.It is the fourth time this month that HSBC has been forced to apologise to customers over mobile or online banking disruptions, with outages also logged on 6, 16 and 18 November.The latest problem came as MPs on the Treasury select committee, in an embarrassing coincidence for HSBC, launched a formal inquiry into banking IT failures, after glitches at Barclays, TSB and Visa affected key services for millions of customers this year.The committee chairwoman, Nicky Morgan, said: “The number of IT failures at banks and other financial institutions in recent years is astonishing. Since becoming chair of the committee 16 months ago, there have been problems at Equifax, TSB, Visa, Barclays, Cashplus and RBS, to name a few.“Millions of customers have been affected by the uncertainty and disruption caused by failures of banking IT systems. Measly apologies and hollow words from financial services institutions will not suffice when consumers aren’t able to access their own money and face delays in paying bills.“As bank branches close and customers are ushered towards online services, the availability of those services is vital.”Figures recently compiled by the consumer group Which? showed the UK has lost nearly two-thirds of its bank and building society branches over the past 30 years, as companies plough ahead with cost cuts and digital banking drives.The number of branches has dropped from 20,583 in 1988 to 7,586, leaving more customers to rely on online services susceptible to IT blunders.RBS and Barclays – which have closed 424 and about 200 branches respectively over the past year – both experienced IT service disruptions in September that affected online banking customers.HSBC has not closed any branches this year, but customers are still adjusting to a restructuring programme under which the bank reduced its branch network by nearly 400.TSB’s IT meltdown was one of the most high-profile cases in the UK, costing the challenger bank £250m and thousands of lost customers. It had been working to move accounts from an IT system inherited from the bank’s previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group, to one owned and created by its Spanish owner, Sabadell, back in April.The botched migration locked millions of customers out of their accounts and caused prolonged disruption for account holders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b68daf0c74d02c3ceb8f423c5ccdbf4bef31584a/1096_1032_4031_2419/master/4031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61ad98f65addfeb93dc5311b548b53fd","title":"meet denise coates best paid bet 365","story":"She built Bet365 in a Portakabin in Stoke. Now she’s paid three times more than CEO of AppleIf Denise Coates’s record-breaking £265m pay packet was stacked up in new £50 notes it would form a tower almost twice as high as the Shard skyscraper in London.The enormous pay package, paid to the founder and chief executive of Bet365, the online gambling business based in Stoke-on-Trent, was more than three times greater than Tim Cook earned (£80m) running Apple, the most valuable company in the world. It was 25 times more than Bob Dudley received for running BP and 55 times more than the £4.9m that Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, has to rub along on.For Coates, the best paid female executive in the world, it was not even a one-off. A year earlier, she handed herself £217m from the profits of what remains a private family owned business, albeit one worth billions.All the numbers associated with Bet365 are big: gamblers wagered £52.5bn with the company last year, a sum that outstrips the annual economic output of Croatia and Uruguay.As eye-catching as Bet365’s financial performance is, it garnered far less attention than the £220m salary and £45m in idends pocketed by Coates, who owns more than half the company. Vince Cable, the former business minister and Liberal Democrat leader, called Coates’s pay package “irresponsible and excessive”, while the High Pay Centre said it was “obscene”.If Bet365 were listed on the stock exchange, such payouts would probably fall at the first hurdle of shareholder distaste, as seen in the revolt against the £100m bonus deal handed to the chief executive of the housebuilder Persimmon. Jeff Fairburn eventually offered to hand back £25m and make a donation to charity – but the embarrassment heaped on the company led to his departure this month.Bet365 is the personal fiefdom of the Coates family, a business dynasty worth £5.8bn, more than Sir Richard Branson’s empire. The story of how they built their empire from a Portakabin in Stoke-on-Trent is the stuff of industry legend.Coates’s father, Peter, the 80-year-old son of a miner, became a successful local businessman and owned a string of betting shops. But it was Coates, an econometrics graduate who, at around the turn of the millennium, became aware of the jackpot opportunity that lay online.She bought the Bet365 domain name from eBay for $25,000 and borrowed against the bricks-and-mortar stores to develop sports-betting technology that left slow-moving rivals in the dust.When the likes of Ladbrokes and William Hill were buying the systems they needed from third parties, Bet365 already had them and was deploying them at great speed.Under Coates’s stewardship, the firm married its tech advantage with shrewd marketing – the actor Ray Winstone fronts their TV campaigns tied to live sports and virtually orders viewers to make a wager: “Bet in play – now!” he growls.But Bet365 is not just about taking a punt on the Premier League from the comfort of a sofa. Fancy a bet on the correct score in the AS Oued Ellil match against AS Marsa in Tunisia’s League 2? Or a wager on Irish club hurling, Austrian cross-country skiing, Australian political elections, Italy’s X Factor, on Vegas games or at a live online casino? Bet365 claims to have 35 million customers, which would make it the world’s biggest online gambling business.Now the company looks poised to break into the US, via a $50m (£39m) deal with a New York casino operator designed to take advantage of the huge growth potential in the country since the supreme court repealed a decades-old ban on sports betting.Bet365 is fast becoming Stoke’s most successful export. Its tech-based success story looms large in a city once dominated by its potteries, such as Wedgwood, Spode and Royal Doulton.It owns the Stoke City Football Club, while many of its 4,000-member workforce are based at its sprawling headquarters near Hanley, Stoke’s de facto city centre.Bet365 does not seem keen on media scrutiny and rarely answers inquiries, choosing to disclose only what it must in regulated filings with Companies House.It has not, for instance, addressed any criticism of Coates’s pay deal, which some have found jarring in a week when new figures showed an alarming rise in the number of child problem gamblers.Charles and Liz Ritchie, who founded the Gambling With Lives charity after their son, Jack, killed himself after a gambling addiction, said they found Coates’s payout “particularly upsetting” in the circumstances.While Coates gives much of her cash to good causes, such as the Douglas Macmillan Hospice and Alzheimer’s Research UK, her foundation’s page on the Charity Commission website offers no indication of whether any of it goes to problem gambling treatment.Her largesse is also partly funded by a relatively low UK corporation tax rate, and the company’s £78m tax contribution last year was rather less than one might expect, thanks in part to subsidiaries in jurisdictions such as Gibraltar, a haven for gambling firms.Bet365 has also been coy about where its customers are based. A  investigation in 2014 found that punters in China – where betting is banned in all but a few tightly controlled arenas – were jailed after apparently placing bets on the Bet365 website.The company said it was not breaking any laws but would not confirm whether or not it accepted stakes.In this week’s accounts Bet365 said disclosing any more about its regional income “would be severely prejudicial to the interests of the group”. A recruitment page reveals the company is looking for “Chinese language customer account advisors”, though it could be targeting Chinese speakers in the UK or elsewhere.Unless Bet365 volunteers more information, it will remain one of Britain’s most opaque companies – but also one of its most successful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74c3d690b90e328eafe27f43915a3fb87745d9f4/0_0_4733_3115/master/4733.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d80f46251665f4d4e6c54b4beef3bc3c 2020w","title":"dup theresa may party conference brexit deal conservatives","story":"It was all so different this time last year. Arlene Foster had been able to boost her personal authority (which had been damaged in the 2017 Northern Ireland assembly election when, for the first time, unionists lost their overall majority) by emphasising the “real power” that accompanied the “hugely significant” deal between the Democratic Unionist party and Conservatives. She earned thunderous applause at her party conference when she boasted, “The union is secure.”Today, that confidence and supply agreement – in which the DUP props up Theresa May’s minority government – is, at best, wobbly and the DUP is accusing May of a “gross betrayal” that threatens to “undermine our precious union”. Tory leadership hopeful Boris Johnson will provide high-profile knockabout at this year’s conference for a grassroots audience that needs cheering up, but the DUP leadership would have preferred a prime minister who had faced down the European Union and stood shoulder to shoulder with Foster.It has been a bad year for the DUP. Vociferous objections from some of their key players to the prospect of an Irish Language Act killed off rising hopes of a new power-sharing deal with Sinn Féin in February, meaning that Northern Ireland is just about to reach 700 days without an assembly. A long-running public inquiry into how a DUP-run department made one monumental and expensive blunder after another has exposed a party at war with itself and operating almost entirely by its own rules. And now May, their supposed ace in the hole, has stared them down with a withdrawal agreement that includes options she knew would have been unacceptable to the DUP. All in all, not the easiest background for an annual conference.The DUP’s primary difficulty with the withdrawal agreement is that it leaves open the possibility that Northern Ireland’s relationship with the EU could, after December 2020, be different to the relationship between the EU and Great Britain. And it’s that difference which raises difficulties for the DUP – and unionism generally – about the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. May argues that there is no threat to the integrity of the union, because the longstanding constitutional guarantee (that Northern Ireland remains in the UK until a referendum in the region decides otherwise) remains in place. But the DUP counters that claim with the argument that treating Northern Ireland so differently in such a specific and momentous circumstance would undermine the union and, consequently, embolden those – on both sides of the border – who want a referendum on Irish unity.The DUP is in a very difficult position. Yes, it could withdraw from the confidence and supply agreement, but that means wandering on to pyrrhic victory territory. There is no guarantee that pulling out would kill off the withdrawal agreement or topple May or that any replacement for her would come up with something better for Northern Ireland.Ironically, the DUP and Theresa May are in similar positions when it comes to power. I don’t think she ever expected to be prime minister: but now that she is, she will hold on for as long as possible. The DUP never expected to sign a confidence and supply deal that put them at the heart of government: but now that they have, they will keep it going for as long as they can.Ending that deal would be a very public admission that the party had been wrong to put so much faith in the Conservatives and it would also raise awkward questions about the relationship between Ulster unionism and UK national interests. The DUP likes the profile and clout it now has (which has also been useful when it comes to government Northern Ireland policy) and it won’t be keen on a crash and burn response to the present problem.So, is there wriggle room? The DUP needs clarity and reassurance on what happens post-2020. Its position since June 2016 has been consistent: as long as the final Brexit deal ensures that the entire UK is treated the same way, it can live with it. It may not like it, but at least there would be no existential threat to the union. The DUP cannot shift without that certainty, but it is in its interests to hang on for as long as it can. When it comes to negotiations it is a canny operator, as anyone who has dealt with it knows.The final decision, of course, rests with the prime minister. Forcing Northern Ireland to be treated differently would lead to serious problems and destabilise the peace process maybe even end it. It would also raise questions in Scotland: “If Northern Ireland can have special arrangements, then why not us?” Crucially, though, May probably does not want to go down in history as the prime minister who began the unravelling of the United Kingdom. The DUP and Theresa May still have mutual interests and goals – at this point. • Alex Kane is a former director of communications for the Ulster Unionist party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1c8ddf8e71962970354e8f10822cfec583a3198/0_13_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0618a1f1ec0e2c97045a3281dd76e3ac","title":"easter island statue britain museum","story":"If the spiritual importance of the artefact matters to its owners, why deny them? This is a political issue, not an aesthetic oneBe prepared. The great museums of Europe are about to see an invasion of former colonies demanding the return of their stuff. This week the governor of Easter Island, Tarita Alarcón Rapu, tearfully pleaded with the British Museum to have back her ancestor, immortally embodied in a statue in its possession. “You have our soul,” she said. Her audience must have cringed.For Rapu’s people the statue, one of many, carries with it the spirit of her island. For Britain it is just a statue, stolen by a British frigate as a bauble for Queen Victoria in 1868. But then Britons can be equally dotty about the Stone of Scone and the crown jewels.The figure joins a lengthening list of items now in contention. Egypt wants back the Rosetta Stone. Nigeria wants the Benin Bronzes. Ethiopia wants the Maqdala crown, and a sacred lock of its emperor’s hair. Various places on the Indian subcontinent claim the Koh-i-Noor diamond, embedded in a UK’s royal crown. There is also the matter of the Parthenon Marbles, which never goes away. This is the thin end of a sizeable wedge.Most rows over “cultural appropriation” come from the wilder shores of identity lunacy. This appropriation is different. The fact that British and other museums are so frantic to hold on to their objects shows the power such things exert over nation states. To the British Museum, the Parthenon Marbles are like fragments of the true cross.The first response to demands for restitution is simple. Concede to them. We have tons of other stuff in basements and attics. To be fair, this is starting to happen. France’s President Emmanuel Macron is legislating to “return Africa’s heritage to Africa”. The British Museum itself returns objects under permanent loan. The Benin bronzes are going to Nigeria and it has indicated a readiness to talk with Easter Island.A deeper worry is what restitution will mean to the purpose of world museums. They really are the heirs to empire. Their apologists incant the curatorial shtick, that they are global custodians, a scholarly resource, a place that gives context to art. If context really matters, why not put the Lewis Chessmen or the Lindisfarne Gospels or the Parthenon Marbles back where they were meant to be enjoyed? The only real argument museums have, if pressed, is that possession is nine-tenths of the law.The reality is that in the age of mass travel and digital reproduction, the convenience of a tiny group of scholars, or even a larger group of tourists, cannot seriously override the looming politics of national self-confidence. A museum, as French art historian André Malraux noted, has always been an artificial concept, a wrenching of objects not into context but out of it. The tossing together of disparate artefacts – most of them never displayed – is like burying them in a mausoleum. It suggests the museum is not about art or beauty but about acquisition, ownership and status.Next week, the most exhilarating room in any London museum is to reopen, the cast court at the Victoria and Albert. Everything in it is fake – majestic, glorious fake – from Trajan’s Column to Michelangelo’s David, from Ghiberti’s Gates of Paradise to the Nymph of Fontainebleau. It is a hugely enjoyable satire on what modern museology has become.What we are not told is that the V\u0026ampA’s copies survived only because its staff, during the “battle of the casts” in the 1920s, did not imitate museums across Britain and America in smashing all replicas as “unauthentic”. This was demanded by the trustees in deference to rich donors, who did not want their gifts appearing near “fakes”. Across America, thousands of perfect replicas of Europe’s greatest art works were simply removed and hammered to dust, leaving galleries empty. Americans were told to revere not what they could see, but what it was worth.Museum objects can now be immaculately reproduced, in photography, film, hologram and cast. The ruins of Palmyra and Nineveh can be restored with 3D printing and carving, even using the original stone and sand. It may not be the same as the original, any more than gothic Chartres or medieval Bodiam are “the same”. The ancient obelisk that forms the focus of the British Library’s current Anglo-Saxon exhibition is made of polystyrene. I doubt if it worries anyone, any more than Venetian tourists dislike the horses of San Marco for being copies. Of course material antiquity can affect the aura of a work, influencing its rarity and thus its price, but not necessarily its intrinsic beauty.The word most beloved of museums is authenticity. I accept that the British Museum’s ice-age exhibition in 2013 was moving because we were looking at objects carved 12 millennia ago. But that was exceptional. I do not despise a Nash terrace or a Rodin statue because it is a replica of an original. The glory of a Robert Adam ceiling lies in its design, not its execution. Enjoyment lies in the genius of what we see, not the age of its materials.There is no reason why the Easter Island statue cannot be perfectly reproduced. If its spiritual content matters so much to the Easter Islanders, why on earth deny them the original? The issue is one of politics, not aesthetics. I fear that unlike art, politics never ages."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d90a889fcd34730c441112bc1a07b628be9af29/0_215_3234_1940/master/3234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42e7cd4b3488aebdd6cae48ee4771965","title":"government universities oxford cambridge moodys","story":"Cambridge and Oxford have high likelihood of support if problems arise, says Moody’sThe government would almost certainly bail out major British universities in financial danger, although less prestigious institutions may not be so lucky, according to a leading credit ratings agency.Moody’s, the international ratings agency, told its clients in a research note that its ratings of universities included a high probability that the government would intervene to prop up an institution in difficulty because of the potential disruption.The report comes despite Moody’s having placed negative warnings on the credit ratings of seven of the nine UK universities that have borrowed funds through international capital markets. Only Oxford and Cambridge are rated as stable by Moody’s.Earlier this month the head of the higher education regulator in England, the Office for Students, said it would not bail out universities in the future. But shortly after, it emerged that the OfS had given a loan worth £900,000 to an unnamed university at risk of running out of cash during the summer.Moody’s said the loan, which the OfS said was subsequently repaid in full, confirmed its view that the regulator and government would be more likely to offer help in the event of insolvency.“This financial assistance supports our assumption of a high probability of extraordinary support for UK universities,” said Jeanne Harrison, a senior analyst at Moody’s. “Our view remains that government links with universities, the OfS’s remit to ensure continuity of education for students, and the economic importance of the university sector provide strong incentives for the government to act to prevent a default by a public university.“Extraordinary support is not limited to financial support and encompasses any government intervention outside of the ordinary course of business to prevent the default of a university in financial distress. Most rated universities receive an uplift of one or two notches to their ratings as a result of our assumption of extraordinary support.”According to Moody’s, both Cambridge and Oxford have a very high probability of government support in the event of financial problems, while the remaining universities – including Manchester and Cardiff – have a high probability of financial aid.“If we were to rate smaller, newer universities, we would likely continue to differentiate on our support assumption and apply a lower assumption for extraordinary support,” Harrison said.Cambridge and Oxford enjoy the agency’s top Aaa credit rating, while Manchester has an Aa2 rating, two notches below. Liverpool, Southampton, Cardiff, De Montfort, Keele and Leeds have Aa3 ratings, along with a negative outlook for future credit ratings.Moody’s said the negative outlooks were the result of sector-wide pressures, including declining numbers of school-leavers, uncertainty around student funding and tuition fees, and Brexit-related risks.“Some rated universities are likely to post operating deficits as a result of these pressures over the next couple years,” the agency said, although it expected credit ratings to remain good thanks to manageable debts and the strong international reputation of UK universities.Universities are also likely to face additional pension costs as the Universities Superannuation Scheme said it would carry out a new valuation of its position after institutions indicated they were willing to pay more to maintain the scheme."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1473ea99027271d3b9edeb6aef037de5c7e81bd5/0_116_5146_3088/master/5146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb173a071332dc84ef2e5e6855a91036","title":"hundreds state schools unrepresented top graduate schemes england","story":"State-educated applicants to graduate schemes at top firms come from elite pool – reportApplications to graduate-entry positions at leading law, finance and management firms reveal an “unrecognised apartheid” among England’s state schools, according to research that found more than 1,000 state secondary schools had no former pupils applying to elite programmes.While the success of former independent school pupils in applying to graduate positions has long been recognised, the research by Rare, a specialist recruitment and ersity consultancy, reveals a premier league of state schools that enjoy similar application rates.Rare said the results suggest the traditional split between independent and state schools is not the only iding line in British education. “There is also an unrecognised apartheid within the UK’s state school system, raising serious questions for government, employers and schools alike about how to ensure fair life chances for the country’s young people,” it said.The research examined the applications made by more than 160,000 graduates in 2017-18 to more than 60 graduate recruitment programmes run by companies including Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Slaughter and May.Raph Mokades, Rare’s managing director, said it was misleading to see state schools as a uniform bloc, since most of those in the elite group had a high proportion of students from affluent backgrounds who went on to leading research universities.But Mokades said the data showed school background remained powerful, so that those from lower-performing schools were less likely to apply to elite graduate programmes.“We have found that the university you go to doesn’t completely eradicate the influence of the school that you went to,” Mokades said.“Geography plays a part in this but only a part. We also found high-performing schools that had very few pupils apply, so there is something else going on here,” said Mokades, who argues that employers should do more to identify talent from those schools.The state school that generated the highest numbers of applications was the Henrietta Barnett school, a selective girls’ school in north London with exceptionally high A-level results. But the elite group also included a small number of non-selective schools, such as Coopers’ Company and Coborn school in Havering, which produced high proportions of applicants despite more modest A-level results.According to Mokades, one prime difference was in the quality of a school’s careers advice and contacts with recruiters, which could explain why some schools with strong A-level results produced few applicants.Lucy Powell, the Labour MP and a member of the Commons education select committee, said: “There is no excuse in this day and age for a system that creates preferential treatment to a minority of elite, well-connected schools. We need real careers advice to ensure opportunities are open to all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b248f1b4dc6e253135c0aa11f852e6dfd157ddc7/0_238_4631_2778/master/4631.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e9f30d4a2b7e7440c20b70d43b4937d","title":"climate change america us government report","story":"Climate change is already harming Americans’ lives with “substantial damages” set to occur as global temperatures threaten to surge beyond internationally agreed limits, a major US government report has warned.The influence of climate change is being felt across the US with increases in disastrous wildfires in the west, flooding on the east coast, soil loss in the midwest and coastal erosion in Alaska, according to the US National Climate Assessment.  saw a draft of the report before publication on Friday.The draft outlined that “impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans’ physical, social, and economic wellbeing are rising”. Climate change-related risks “will continue to grow without additional action”, it added.The quadrennial report, the combined work of 13 federal agencies, was released by the Trump administration on the day after Thanksgiving. Scientists who worked on the report said their research was not watered down but claimed the release was timed to bury the findings during the holiday season.Global temperatures could be limited to 2C above pre-industrial era if greenhouse gas emissions are slashed but “without significant reductions, annual average global temperatures could increase by 9F (5C) or more by the end of this century”, a previously released chapter states.Even 2C warming is likely to have major ramifications for societies, as the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report spelled out. Heating the planet well beyond this would create a “totally different world”, said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University. “It would be indescribable, it would turn the world upside down in terms of its climate. There would be nothing like it in the history of civilization.”Oppenheimer, with many other scientists, has said warming of around 3C is more likely given the advance of renewable energy and expected emissions reductions in the future. “That is more of an economic, political and technology question,” a report author who wished to remain unnamed told the . “It’s hard to say what we are on track for right now.”The draft report warned that the current response was insufficient to stave off the worst impacts, stating that “neither global efforts to mitigate the causes of climate change nor regional efforts to adapt to the impacts currently approach the scales needed to avoid substantial damages to the US economy, environment, and human health and well-being over the coming decades”.Another report author said: “Climate change is loading the dice against us, it’s going to affect our water, food and ecosystems. This report is important because it shows it’s already happening where we live, not on far off islands or at the poles.”Included in the dozens of draft report chapters:The national climate assessment is mandated by Congress to compile the latest research on climate change. The last report came out in 2014. Donald Trump has since announced the US will withdraw from the Paris climate deal, with his administration working to dismantle every major policy designed at lowering emissions.The release of the report comes as California is racked by its most deadly wildfire on record, the so-called Camp fire, which razed the town of Paradise. At least 84 people have died and tens of thousands of people have had to flee the fire, which has occurred at the same time as a smaller blaze further south, near Los Angeles.Trump has downplayed assertions by scientists and firefighters that climate change is making California more wildfire-prone, instead pointing to “gross mismanagement” of forest areas. Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, has said conservationist lawsuits by “radical environmental groups” were to blame.While visiting devastated parts of California last weekend Trump was asked if what he had seen and heard had changed his mind about climate change, which he has previously called a “hoax”. Trump responded to the question with a firm: “No.”“When there are daily images of California burning up it’s hard for the administration to argue climate change isn’t happening,” said Oppenheimer. “The strategy seems to be let sleeping dogs lie and hope the public doesn’t pay much attention to it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ba6450d2db3b65e13c77a791f3204405e94e8ed/0_214_3204_1922/master/3204.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6268b33f927060453e896752e06d020","title":"brazil records worst annual deforestation for a decade","story":"Nearly 8,000sq kms lost in the year to July amid alarm new president Jair Bolsonaro will make situation worseThe news was met by dismay from environmentalists who warned deforestation was likely to become more acute when Bolsonaro becomes president on 1 January.“It is a lot of destroyed forest,” said Marcio Astrini, Greenpeace Brasil’s public policy coordinator. “The situation is very worrying… what is bad will get worse.”The environment ministry said the increase came despite an increase in its budget and in operations carried out by its environment agency Ibama.“We need to increase the mobilisation at all levels of government, of society, and of the productive sector to combat illicit environmental activities,” environment minister Edson Duarte said in a statement.But the government appears to be heading in the other direction.After falling for several years, deforestation began rising again in 2013, the year after leftist president Dilma Rousseff approved a new forest code which gave an amnesty to those deforesting on small properties. Deforestation has risen in four of the six years since then, including in 2016, the year Rousseff was impeached and replaced by her former vice-president Michel Temer.Temer has made further concessions to powerful agribusiness interests in return for support from its congressional representatives – including approving a measure that legalised land that had been squatted in the Amazon, a common deforestation driver. Last year Temer backed down on measures to reduce protection to a national forest called Jamanxim and a protected area called Renca after protests from environmentalists, supermodel Gisele Bündchen and even singer Alicia Keys at the Rock in Rio music festival.Moves like these signalled the Brazilian congress was no longer concerned about deforestation, said Astrini, encouraging deforestation.“We feel in our field work that these deforestation gangs are very confident they will get amnesty or that they are covered,” he said. As more and more of the Amazon is cut down, the world’s greatest forest is now getting close to the “tipping point” – after which experts fear it could disappear.It also expects deforestation to worsen once Jair Bolsonaro’s new government begins. He has frequently attacked what he calls the “fines industry” of agencies such as Ibama, and wants to allow mining in protected indigenous reserves – some of the Amazon’s least-destroyed forests – and even considered making the environment ministry part of the agriculture ministry.Bolsonaro has enjoyed support from agribusiness and his minister of agriculture will be headed up by Tereza Cristina, head of its Congress lobby.His foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo, has argued that global warming is a Marxist plot. On Friday, his vice-president elect, General Hamilton Mourão, while admitting global warming did exist, told the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper: “Environmentalism is used as an instrument of domination by big economies.”Bolsonaro only backed down on plans to withdraw Brazil from the Paris climate deal because agricultural producers argued the move risked boycotts from European consumers, local media reported.“If the problem is in politics and politicians and their power of decision, they need to be pressured,” Astrini said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d876cf0adf5d63586d948b5d234aa8f6bb3b87e/0_428_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52fb16c1347d81fddb66f6d9bb40e02c","title":"london schools tackle pollution with face masks and air purifiers","story":"Schools introduce walk-to-school initiatives and stock up on asthma medicineSchools across the UK are taking ever more drastic steps in an effort to mitigate the effects of air pollution on their pupils’ health.Amid growing concern about the long-term implications of toxic air on young people’s development, the  has found one London school is raising money for face masks for its pupils, while a growing number are installing air purifiers in classrooms and thousands more are trying to deter parents from using their cars on the school run.The measures follow a flurry of new studies that show the extent of the damage being done to young people’s health from respiratory problems such as asthma.Dr Ian Mudway, air pollution expert at Kings College London, said there was an urgent need to improve air quality, especially in congested cities, to protect the wellbeing of future generations.“As the evidence base grows demonstrating that air pollution impacts on the health of children born and growing up in our cities, so the justification for decisive action increases,” he said.Rotherhithe primary school in south-east London has launched a fundraising campaign to address air pollution which includes buying face masks for pupils.The campaign was launched by Kellie Ansell, the deputy head, who has noticed how poor air quality is affecting the children.“We have a cupboard full of children’s asthma medicines,” she said. has found that at least 10 other schools have installed – or are planning to install – air purifiers and thousands more are taking measures to tackle pollution.Some are installing green walls while others are closing roads and setting up “park and stride” schemes or walk-to-school initiatives.Kathryn Shaw from charity Living Streets, which aims to encourage walking and cycling, said schools were on the frontline in fight against pollution.But she said face masks were not the answer. “Children resorting to wearing air pollution masks is a sign that when it comes to cleaning up our air, we are falling woefully short,” she said. “Resigning ourselves to these adaptations rather than tackling the source of air pollution solves very little and is a great disservice to future generations.”Dr Ben Barratt from King’s College London agreed that masks were not the answer.He said that they could filter out some particulate pollution if they were “good quality” and very well fitted, but added: “If they don’t fit properly, they’re useless, and most do not filter out harmful gases such as nitrogen dioxide.”“It is not a solution or even a good sticking plaster,” Barratt said. “Increasing the physical activity of kids is extremely important and anything that hinders that may do more harm than good … we must rapidly and effectively remove the source of air pollution, not punish those who are not responsible for creating it.”Ansell said her school was also looking at other ways of tackling pollution, but added that she believes the masks were necessary to give pupils immediate access to clean air as measures to tackle pollution would not be effective immediately.“We are hoping to do more, such as closing off the street to traffic at the beginning and end of the school day and to plant more greenery in the playground, but pupils still have to walk home along busy roads.“The masks will be a real physical and visible response to air pollution. As well as giving children clean air to breathe, they will also raise awareness about the issue of air pollution, which we are studying as part of the curriculum.”Earlier this year the  revealed how children were being forced to breathe dangerous levels of toxic air as they make their way to and from school – and even once they are inside their classrooms.One school in London found it had levels of dangerous particulate pollution exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in every classroom – and two were more than three times over the limit.Now one company that makes air purifiers, Blueair of Sweden, says it has tested air quality at 10 schools in London and found that in each it was worse inside the classroom than in the playground or the street – sometimes by a staggering amount.Sara Alsen from Blueair said: “The scale of the problem of air pollution in London schools is acute … some classrooms have pollution levels 20-40 times the levels recommended by WHO.”She said this was because Victorian schools buildings often lack proper ventilation, meaning the harmful airborne particles get trapped inside classrooms.“It is clear that awareness about indoor air pollution is increasing in the UK. Every day we get calls from parents worrying about the health of their children and we are currently working with some 10 London schools,” she said.A stylish mask that claims to protects against “all PMs” – the fine particles from air pollution that damage health – by a triple-layer filter system. It comes in styles that all relate to famous and fictional Brits: the Austen comes in a patchwork pattern and the Sherlock is adorned with cutesy pipes and moustaches. If you’re worried about young family members breathing in fumes, these masks will be by far the easiest to get them to wear. cambridgemaskThese are the masks you see Beijing residents wearing on the street and raise the question: how much air pollution does a surgeon really have to combat in a sterilised hospital? The main issue is if they don’t fit well around the face, then they offer almost zero protection from pollution. If they do fit well, then they are difficult to breathe through. Available on AmazonRespro produces a series of masks you have to be either supremely confident or very concerned to wear. Despite its ugliness, the Ultralight mask was by far and away the most comfortable. There is a PM2.5 filter for heavily polluted areas and, after a quick cycle to work (easy to breathe), there was indeed a thin film of grey dirt on the filter. It comes with a heavy-duty nose clip, and is made from a technical fabric “that lets the skin breathe”. Even after wearing it for a cycle, it doesn’t feel clammy, and it comes in four sizes, so the small size could fit a child’s face. resproThese masks are rated N99 (the best protection you can get) and have received approval from the Chinese and Korean health ministries. They come with single and double valves to breathe through, and are made from soft material that goes easy on the skin. The filters are non-replaceable, so consider that you will need to buy a new mask every few months if you live in a city with high pollution levels.  vogmask"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f388956aec7b28c29da174623026a95626b7a68/525_140_6039_3623/master/6039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d36ed5877e2a2de20eb527ec9db8494","title":"want better deal talking brexit fishing trawler","story":"Twenty miles off the coast of Cornwall lies one of the most fiercely contested Brexit battlelines. Do UK fishermen still want out? by  Sam Wollaston Photography by  Antonio OlmosOut of an apocalyptic yellow sky a salvo of white missiles rains down, plummeting into an angry black sea. Gannets, here for a free lunch. It’s hauling time on Crystal Sea, and for any young gurnard or whiting small and determined enough to wriggle free at this stage, just before the net is lifted from the water, liberty is short-lived. The escapee is snatched, underwater, then launched rudely up into the sky where it quickly disappears, headfirst, into a seabird, accompanied by a triumphant squawk. This is not a good place to be a fish.The birds are joined by dolphins, in from the flank, five or six of them, leaping joyfully from the face of a wave. They like the company, the skipper Dave Stevens likes to think, and he likes theirs it’s reassuring. They’re not here for a meal, though – they’re here for the show. And what a spectacle it is, all that colour and splashing and e-bombing. It’s beautiful and thrilling, horrific and terrifying, all at the same time. What a racket, too: the avian screeching, the grinding of the trawler’s main power winch, the metallic clanking of chain and trawl doors, the howl of a south-westerly force 7. There’s a bit of human yelling, too, men trying to be heard above the elements.In the wheelhouse, Dave turns the boat through 90 degrees, so that the net moves from the back to the side. Operating the smaller winch, Latvian fisherman Girts Kraulis hoists the dripping trawl up out of the sea, a huge teardrop of fish, some with their heads poking through the holes, as if taking one last look at the world they’re leaving.Braced on the pitching deck, Girts’s countryman Robert Vimba helps to manoeuvre the net into the bag hatch. Girts lowers it to the fish deck below, where Robert’s twin brother Edgar unties the bottom of the cod end and the catch spills out into the fish hopper. No cod today, but plenty of other fish: haddock and John Dory, plaice, sole, squid and cuttlefish (the ink from which has squirted over some of the others). The dead and the dying nearly reach the top of Edgar’s boots. A crab makes a vain dash for it, a dogfish writhes, the last pulses of life travel along the fins of the flatfish. A big monkfish yawns, opening up a vast and ancient cavern full of stalagmites and stalactites. Soon it will have its head hacked off (monkfish go to market without their heads: too ugly). Heads you lose, tails you also lose – or win, if you’re the fishermen: they like monkfish, and John Dory, which fetch a good price.Now Girts, Robert and Edgar stand in a line at a conveyor belt with their knives, gutting, sorting, discarding, chopping the wings off the rays, which will be skate when they get to the fishmonger. Dave joins them, keeping an eye on the screen which shows where they are at sea, and if there are any other vessels they are in danger of colliding with. There’s not much banter, very little chat even they just get on with it.The fish is washed, sorted and sized, lowered further down into the refrigerated hold, where it is packed with ice in boxes and stacked. By which time the nets will have already been out again for a couple of hours, ready to haul again in another three. It’s relentless, working on a trawler.Crystal Sea is a 20-metre twin-rig stern trawler, one of the bigger boats operating out of Newlyn in Cornwall. Twin rig means she drags two nets, side by side. She catches a mix of fish, up to 30 different species, operating anywhere between six and 120 miles from home. In the four days I am on board – to get a Brexit perspective from 49° 48’N, 5° 48’W and thereabouts, as well as to get some idea of what this very tough job involves – we are mainly between 10 and 20 miles from shore.At 10 years old, she is also one of the newer and better-equipped boats operating out of Newlyn. As well as all the mechanical gear a modern trawler has – winches and cranes, conveyor belts and ice-makers, the navigational equipment, GPS and radar – there’s a washing machine. The galley has a cooker, fridge, toaster and a deep-fat fryer. There’s a telly, on, loud, all the time – Homes Under The Hammer, Bargain Hunt, Scotland-Fiji in the rugby – even though there’s no time to watch. There’s even wifi, via a satellite.If I’m making it sound comfortable, it isn’t. Crystal Sea is a working fishing boat, damp and cramped. The cabin is especially hellish, down a ladder into a hot dark smelly hole below the waterline where you have to fumble to find your bunk. At the same level but forward of here, through a bulkhead, the fish sleep on ice.Dave Stevens’ family, from St Ives, have been fishing for generations, Dave has been doing it for 29 years, since he was 15. Now he works the boat with his brother Alec, and they do alternate weeks. It gets harder as you get older, Dave says. A big bear of a man – all the men are big – he’s unflustered, traditional, thoughtful and softly spoken, with a gentle Cornish accent.Girts, aged 47, and the Vimba brothers, 32 (it’s hard to tell them apart when they’re in their oilskins and you can’t see Edgar’s tattoos) are from the port of Ventspils on the Baltic. They commute from Latvia to Cornwall: two months on, one off, leaving friends and family behind. Girts’s daughter joined him for a bit, got a job in a crab factory, but now she’s back home studying law. On the boat, Girts’s mood is directly proportional to both the weather and how the fishing is going. The men, including Dave, are paid on a share-of-catch basis on a good week, they can net a grand each.Edgar doesn’t have a family, but Robert has a wife and two kids with another on the way. She would like to come over he’s not sure about it. He’s at sea, there’s no family to support her here – and if she went back to work, it would probably be to a crab factory, whereas in Latvia she’s got a nice office job for a fuel company. None of them know how their lives will be affected by Brexit.As a member (just) of the EU, Britain is signed up to the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which means we do not control our own waters. All the rules – about catches, quotas, discards – come from the European Commission. Fish are seen as a common resource waters are shared you fish in mine, I’ll fish in yours. Voulez-vous pêcher avec moi, ce soir? It sounds like the very spirit of European unity and collaboration, but if you speak to Dave, or any other British fisherman or fisherwoman (a rare species in British waters), they’ll tell you it simply isn’t fair. Britain has some of the best fishing grounds in Europe suddenly, after 1973, we had to share them. So we’re free to fish in their waters, too? So what, we’re not bothered – the fishing’s fine at home.Inevitably, fishing played its part in the referendum campaign. Remember Nigel Farage coming up the Thames on a fishing boat, throwing a few haddock around, trading insults with Bob Geldof on the good ship Remain?As well as the injustice of having to share fishing waters, Dave’s other big beef with the EU is all the top-down micromanagement. We speak while he is on watch, sitting in one of the surprisingly comfy chairs in the wheelhouse. “Most companies and organisations I know listen to their workforces, and that feedback works up through the chain, not the other way round. The CFP is trying to manage on such a large scale, it just won’t work. Fishing is different in many areas around EU waters.”On quotas, for example, Dave thinks they’re not always getting it right. Sometimes the people who decide how much of one stock can be fished are working from data that is a few years old. “You need a more flexible approach. So if you’re catching too much of one species, it’s more abundant on the ground than the science would suggest – you should be able to take that species.”By take, he means keep, as opposed to discarding. On this trip he’s been discarding haddock, because he’s catching many more than he has a quota for. To see a beautiful freshly caught haddock going down the chute with the offal, dead, into the sea is a sickening sight, unless you’re a lazy gannet.Dave says his leave vote wasn’t purely based on fishing he made up his mind while visiting the EU headquarters in Brussels. He was there to make a presentation to a roundtable meeting about a filter that would allow smaller fish to escape the net, after which he went to meet his MEP, Julie Girling, in the chamber. The floor started to fill up, hundreds of people. “So I asked Julie, ‘Who are all these people? They can’t all be MEPs.’ And she said, ‘No, most are lobbyists, working for either NGOs or big chemical companies and the like.’ I was kind of taken aback. I’m not naive, I know that lobbying goes on – but it was the enormous scale of it. There must have been four or five lobbyists for every MEP.” He asked her how often she met her constituents, and she said it was quite rare for them to come to Brussels. “And I said, ‘That’s it, I’m out.’” When Dave talks about the hordes of circling lobbyists, it’s hard not to think of gannets.As we talk in the wheelhouse, he’s keeping an eye on what’s going on, outside, and on the panel of screens in front of him. One shows where we are, and who else is around (there are no other fishing boats) another shows the topography of the seafloor a third shows the F1 Grand Prix from Brazil (we have Sky Sports, too). A big white splodge on the radar is an approaching squall. They generally seem to hit at hauling time.Gale warning issued: 09.50 on Mon 12 Nov 2018 UTC. South-westerly gale force 8 expected soon. Wind: westerly or south-westerly 5-7, occasionally gale 8 in north. Sea state: rough or very rough. Weather: thundery showers. Visibility: mainly good.Today there are no high-pressure systems coming from the south, bringing fair or settled weather. The conditions are “poor”, as Dave says, with characteristic understatement, for the whole trip. Strong winds, big seas, five-metre waves this is about the worst weather they go out in, and why we’re at sea for just four days, instead of the usual six.But even storm clouds have silver linings. Being one of the bigger boats in the fleet means Crystal Sea is one of the few that will be out in these conditions. One of the larger beam trawlers from Newlyn had to be towed home by a sister ship due to engine trouble in the night. But we’re still catching fish – a lot of fish, and good fish: plenty of John Dory and monkfish. And because rough weather means fewer fish coming in, the price tends to go up as the Beaufort scale does.But the crew’s mood doesn’t get a similar bounce. “When it’s like this, shitty weather, it’s not great,” Girts says. I don’t think I’d want to be around Girts when the weather and the fishing were bad. “It’s not the best job in the world, it’s not the worst.”Robert says it’s not so bad. Until recently he was on a crabbing boat, and that was more physical, with more lifting. But trawling is more dangerous, with all the heavy gear and cables and everything thrashing around in the big seas. “Every job is as dangerous as you make it, but we really are exposed,” Dave admits. He had an accident when he was 20, working on his dad’s boat north of Scilly. “A big piece of equipment came down, pinned me to the deck and crushed my leg. I was taken to shore by the lifeboat, I was lucky – then to Truro by air ambulance, where they patched me up.” Dave, not one to exaggerate, reckons that without the helicopter he probably wouldn’t have made it.From where I’m standing – or trying to stand – it looks both dangerous and bloody hard work. There is the sheer constant physicality of it – handling heavy warps and chains, pulling, tying, lifting – and the absolute relentlessness of it: haul, shoot the nets again, process, pack, store, grab a couple of hours’ sleep if you can, on watch, haul again, 247. Plus cooking, one proper meal a day, burgers and chips, stew, rice, no fish (I’m not surprised, I don’t feel like fish). Meanwhile everything and everywhere – your workplace, kitchen, bedroom, toilet – is bucking around like a bronco.Of course there is a bloody great blue whale in the cabin here. Are the Latvian crew – Girts, Robert and Edgar – aware of the irony? Has the leave skipper not noticed that his workforce comes from another EU member state? Girts, whose English is the best of the three, tells me he’s concerned about the prospect of a hard Brexit, and what that would mean when it came to his right to live and work in Britain. Dave doesn’t think it will be an issue, even with a hard Brexit. “I don’t see them stopping people moving around Europe,” he says. “We believe in fair play,” he adds, old-fashionedly.It has been hard to recruit locally. “It’s the fault of our industry, and the reputation our industry has,” Dave says. “People see it as a dangerous, dead-end job. All the talk in the media is that there are no fish left in the sea, we’re not sustainable, it’s all our fault – and it really is not like that.” He continues to look forward to having a mix of crew, from Latvia, the UK, wherever, just “the best guys to go to sea with”.But Brexit isn’t just about unfair quotas, and recruitment issues it’s also about trade, and what happens next. If Britain is no longer signed up to the CFP, then surely the EU will just close down its market, which is where a lot of Britain’s fish goes? Dave says they don’t want to ban foreign boats completely, to pull up the drawbridge. He expects to see EU boats in British waters after March next year, but under a licensing system – as there is in Norway and Iceland. “We fully expect there to be mutual benefits. We just want a better deal, because at the moment we have a very, very poor deal,” he says. (This is damning from a man who describes a force 7 with five-metre waves as merely “poor”.)Dave is not even worried about European markets being closed to us. “We do £1bn worth of fish trade with the EU, they do similar trade with us, trade for trade it’s pretty equal,” he says. “But the EU has been a declining market for fish products from the UK for over 20 years now. We are looking at the Middle East, China. It is a truly global market and we’ve been selling into those markets for the last 10, 15 years. They’re growing all the time.”A bigger worry for Dave is that the transition period, throughout which the UK will still be tied to the CFP, will drag on for years – more negotiations, new rules being drawn up, new quotas, new rights of access. Or that they will be betrayed again, as they were in 1973 – the government (whoever it is) trading access to British waters in order to secure more favourable terms in other, more profitable sectors. And it won’t just be a few haddock, it’ll be the entire UK fishing industry going down that offal chute to be fed to the gannets.Right now though, there’s a boat to be unloaded. After four days out, Crystal Sea chugs slowly back in to Newlyn once there’s enough water to get in on the rising tide. Conditions aside, it has been a decent four days. In the hold there are 230 boxes of fish – monkfish, bream, ray wings, dover sole, sand sole, lemon sole, Cornish sole, all the soles, squid, cuttlefish, crab, conger eel, hake, lobster, plaice, gurnard, haddock, John Dory, octopus, red mullet, sea bass, lesser-spotted dogfish, smoothhounds, tope, turbot and whiting. 9,288kg in total. We’ve also brought back a tonne of rubbish, dragged up from the bottom of the sea – discarded crab and lobster pots rusty old oil drums a few trainers (there are usually trainers: they come from a container that fell off a ship 20 years ago, and are still being fished up) the vertebra of a large whale.Dave’s dad, David Sr, 68, who doesn’t go to sea any more but is still very much involved, is on the quay to help unload and operate the crane. The boxes are lifted from the boat on to the waiting lorry, which leaves for Plymouth, where the fish will be sold in the morning. Most will go to the UK market – wholesalers, fishmongers. Some will probably go to Europe, still. Some might even go to the Middle East, or China.Dave gets a week ashore, just in time to scrutinise Theresa May’s draft deal. He’ll be concerned about possible links between access to waters and trade. And about the transition period getting drawn out. But at least, during that time, he gets to keep his crew.Edgar, Robert and Girts will sleep on the boat tonight, but it won’t be pitching about and they won’t have to get up through the night, pull on oilskins and boots. Tomorrow they’ll be off to sea again. This time the forecast isn’t so bad.• Commenting on this piece?

The animation, the Hollywood version of Edwardian England, the playful verbosity of the songs and above all, the presentation of Mrs Banks as a larky suffragette are understood to have enraged the Australian author, as, surely would this: the co-option of Mary Poppins as a feminist.It is an irritating reflex to take beloved figures from childhood fiction and bend them to adult political ends, but it is particularly perverse in the case of Poppins, given her creator’s dislike of piety. The original Poppins is not quite the spit-spot version with whom most of us are familiar, but a far darker, more irregular creature, powered in places by what reads as sublimated rage and inclined to embrace something that sails close to atheism.None of which is to say that Travers was right to despise the Disney version. After many years of not watching or thinking about the movie, I have been forced to re-engage with it as my children work their way through the Disney back catalogue and in anticipation of Mary Poppins Returns, the Emily Blunt reboot, directed by Rob Marshall and due to open at Christmas. What strikes me is how devastating the original film was.Poppins is a cypher at the heart of the movie who exerts influence not, as Mr Banks specifies in his advert in the Times, by being a “nanny who can give commands”, but in accordance with the principle that one changes others by changing one’s behaviour around them – in the case of Poppins – through a combination of beady observation and strategic obliviousness. She is impatient, indignant, above all incredulous when presented with the weakness of others. (“Are you unwell?” she asks Mr Banks after doing some light magic at him and in what we would, these days, identify as gas lighting.)Which is not to say Poppins is anything but good. She is, however, clearly a woman acquainted with the limitations of others and while she is sent to the Banks household to comfort sad children, it is also her mission to critique the English: coldness as a vehicle for stability blind adherence to tradition and emotional detachment as modes mistaken for virtue, all of which, over the course of the movie, Poppins smartly dismantles.There might have been a question of warmth with the character, were Julie Andrews not such a nuanced performer and there is real pathos in her Poppins, not just in the sadness when she says goodbye to the children, but in the nearest the movie gets to a torch song – a top pick for karaoke! – Feed the Birds. This is fanciful, but when she sings about the Bird Woman I always think Poppins is recognising the ease with which she, or any woman, might slip down the ladder, if we do not adhere to various misogynistic standards. The mad woman on the steps of St Paul’s is all of us and do not make me quote Gilbert and Gubar to prove it.Still, the question of feminism in the movie is a tricky one, not least because the film explicitly mocks the limitations of this kind of labelling, setting up Mrs Banks as a suffragette who is militant outside Downing Street – “take heart for Mrs Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again!” – and submissive at home. (The true feminist statement of the film is, of course, the heroine’s retort to Mr Banks: “Let me make one thing quite clear I never explain anything.”)This is not quite true. For all her seeming invulnerability, Poppins exhibits regret at the end of the movie in a tender moment with her talking umbrella. She is a stoic who counters the stoicism of Mr Banks, an epitome of Englishness charged with the very American project of making those around her articulate their anxieties. (Notably David Tomlinson, who as Mr Banks delivers the heartbreaking monologue about his failures as a parent, a man “brought to rack an’ ruin in his prime.”) She does not have a love interest, which in the context of Hollywood heroines might be considered the most radical thing about her.What is it she teaches the children? Empathy mindfulness a sneaky determination to win (at the horse race). Tidiness. Not to gush. Not to worry, overly, about whether or not they are liked. Simultaneously to believe and not believe what they see. As in the books, she denies to the children that anything magical has happened, inculcating scepticism and something worthwhile about view point.In fact, scepticism is her greatest asset a stand against credulousness and therefore systems, social and political, which would have the children mindlessly repeat what came before simply because it is familiar. And then she buggers off, truly a shocking moment of childhood. I remember the first time I saw this and could not believe a film was allowed to behave this way, break one’s heart so insistently then pretend the reunification of the Banks family was, in fact, a happy ending. No child I know bought into this. Poppins’ departure presages death and even as eight-year-olds, at some level, we knew it.And so she will fly back into our lives this Christmas. The makers of the new film say it is their intention to reintroduce joy at a particularly grim moment in history, but with Poppins it was never a question of joy pure and simple.

Panellists said it had baked apple and elderflower flavours while one likened the aroma of the fizz to lychees. It also scooped one of three coveted ‘Best Buy’ awards.Which? asked supermarkets to nominate their choice of a vintage or non-vintage (NV) champagne alternative for its pre-Christmas taste test. Entries had to be either own-label or exclusive, dry (brut), white, from any grape or blend and priced between £7.50 and £20.The sparkling wine panel experts blind-tasted nine champagne alternatives, working their way through a total of 240 glasses.“For those looking for a change from prosecco this Christmas, our Best Buy English fizz is an excellent option” said Harry Rose, editor of Which? magazine. “The quality and choice on offer this year is good news for lovers of sparkling wine. Whether you’re keen to try something different or you’re a die-hard prosecco fan, our experts have found some great supermarket offerings.”Morrisons’ wine expert, Clive Donaldson, said: “This bubbly offers customers the best of English wine making and will make a splash at any Christmas party.”The second Which? Best Buy – notching up a score of 76 – went to a French sparkling wine. Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Crémant (£11) was praised by the experts as “simple and refreshing” with “attractive herbal and pear notes”.A well-kept secret and alternative to prosecco was the fashionable Italian fizz franciacorta, Which? said. It is made from grapes from the region in Lombardy. Drier than prosecco, it is described as fruitier and softer than champagne, with distinctive lemony notes.The Tesco Finest Franciacorta DOCG Brut (£15) was scored at 75, after judges hailed the “clean, fresh” sparkling wine as a good choice for those who like “gently frothy” bubbles. They said it had a “fine, almost shy mousse”.Asda served up the highest-scoring prosecco. Its Extra Special Prosecco Asolo Brut DOCG – priced at £8 – edged ahead of strong competition from Lidl, Aldi and the Co-op to be awarded 71 by the panel. Describing it as “fun and frothy”, the experts detected “notes of peach and pear.”The consumer group’s wine experts recently also tasted 15 champagnes – all brut (dry) and costing £35 or less. It found that the Co-op’s own-brand champagne was as good as GH Mumm Cordon Rouge, better than Moët \u0026amp Chandon and the best value Christmas bubbly.The British drank 34.4m gallons of sparkling wine last year, but the growth in sales of prosecco has slowed markedly, with drinkers switching to £10 bottles of crémant as a cheap alternative to champagne.The triumph of the homegrown fizz crowns another strong year for the sector. The fall in sterling has handed a Brexit bonus to English sparkling wines, with many considered to match premium French champagnes in quality but now priced the same or less.In a further boost for English producers, the Ridgeview estate in Sussex was this week awarded the coveted trophy of the world’s best winemaker in the International Wine \u0026amp Spirit Competition 2018. This is the first time in the IWSC’s 49-year history that the award has been presented to an English producer.Miles Beale, the chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said: “2018 is proving to be a corking year for English wine. The increased number of vineyards, heatwave and warm autumn have resulted in a bumper harvest for our wine producers, who are delighted with the quality of the grapes.“On top of this, Ridgeview has been crowned the world’s best winemaker, which is a ‘first’ and a sensational achievement. English wine has well and truly earned a world-class reputation for excellence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/075e440cfb32e5dddc6a8a64aa3745c280945414/0_0_3809_2286/master/3809.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd85e1cde16db244d398fe382a880dc4","title":"world cup two years fifa conmebol","story":"Conmebol is lobbying Fifa to stage the World Cup every two years rather than every four, president Alejandro Domínguez confirmed on Friday.Having seen the success of the Uefa Nations League, he would also be open to the possibility of expanding that to include South American teams.“The proposal we have made to Fifa is to play the World Cup every two years and not every four,” Domínguez said. “Instead of having the Nations League in between we can just go ahead every two years and have a World Cup and that is for everyone.“It’s for the players because they could play four World Cups if we move to a two-year cycle. If we stay with this format many players will not be able to play more than two.“There are many solutions. We could hold the tournament in Europe, South America, North America, Africa and Asia without such a long wait. So we see an opportunity there and there is a proposal put forward to Fifa.”Money, needless to say, is a motivating factor. “In terms of economics Fifa make money and give more money,” Domínguez said.What that means for the existing continental tournaments is unclear. Domínguez insists he gets on well with both the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, and the Uefa president, Aleksandar Ceferin, holding a global tournament in a slot currently reserved for the European Championship would clearly be to the benefit of Fifa.The Nations League is an appealing prospect and could serve as a compromise solution rather than abandoning the present structure altogether.Domínguez’s position at present is essentially that he is open to dialogue and keen to prevent Europe moving even further ahead of South America, economically and technically, than it already is. “I always say we have to work together and never say no, I always say why not,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e7b8c91be377b2fa0981298dd36a5df97ae17f/126_126_2813_1688/master/2813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5882072eb4f8bc25aa87c257cfe81194","title":"manchester city fans defence uae sportswashing tribal loyalty","story":"It seems an odd detail now but the first person to find oil in Abu Dhabi was the deep sea explorer Jacques Cousteau, who was employed by a British-run expedition to look for telltale signs in the ocean floor. Modern-day oil prospecting involves satellite imaging and infrared. Back in the 1950s the state of the art was a broodingly handsome celebrity er in a pair of Speedos.It worked, though. In those days the Persian gulf was a coral paradise, home to a booming pearl ing trade. You wonder if, down in the glitter and the deep blue shadows, drawing back his hand from the telltale rock formations, Cousteau saw a gleam of something else too, a reflection in his mask of sky blue figures moving on a field of green, vision of some perfect footballing future waiting to be hoisted out of the ocean floor.Probably not. Cousteau never mentioned it in his films. But then, he never denied it either. And football does seem intent on intruding into every corner these days, parts of the world where the old rules don’t seem to make much sense, where the act of supporting the same team you’ve always supported can present an impossibly mutable sense of right, wrong, loyalty and logic.On Wednesday there was a collective sense of shock at the news the British academic Matthew Hedges had been convicted of spying in the United Arab Emirates. His trial lasted five minutes. There was no lawyer present. Hedges was sentenced to life imprisonment. Among most British observers there was an unease at this summary justice. Although, not so much on social media, where concern was mixed with more sceptical voices voices raising doubts about Hedges’ story, “showing faith” in the lads of the Emirati justice system and generally debating this as though it was a marginal offside decision or a harsh red card.Naturally you’d assume that these voices of authority were professors of Middle Eastern jurisprudence, or at worst a set of official Emirati propaganda bots. But no. They were Manchester City supporters. Miracle of cause and effect! Watching this happen was like the scene in The Martian where, through great patience and skill, Matt Damon eventually succeeds in growing rows of potato sprouts out of piles of human crap. Nine years, £2bn and three league titles into the project, here it was: the spectacle of “sportswashing” in action.It is a phrase that has cropped up a bit recently. “The UAE’s enormous investment in Manchester City is one of football’s most brazen attempts to ‘sportswash’ a country’s deeply tarnished image,” Amnesty International said this month, referring to claims of exploited labour and human rights abuses.Amnesty has been accused of pro-western bias by some and of anti-western bias by others. But whatever your view on claims of torture, it is no secret soft power and reputation management have always been the plan with City. Sportswashing. It sounds possible. But how would that work in practice? Well, here it was in closeup: the unbending loyalties of English club football deployed en masse in defence of something that really does have nothing at all to do with English club football.There are, of course, plenty of caveats here. First, the exchange was sparked by a thought-blurt from the TV personality Piers Morgan, the kind of deliberately provocative Twitter comment that tends to bring the worst out of people. And secondly, this is a small minority. Most City supporters seem to have a far more nuanced view.In any case, what is the “correct” response to all this? There is no model, no approved way to act here. And in isolation it really is a wonderfully seductive wash-job, unprecedented in its beauty, every surface primped and preened and buffed. The football alone is mind-numbingly good, up there with anything the English top tier has seen in the modern age. Oh yeah. Nefarious intentions. We’ll get on to that. Can’t you see there’s a dreamy, feather-footed 6-0 evisceration going on?Plus, we are all complicit to some degree, just as sportswashing itself is nothing new. Britain’s own historic mania for organised sport is based to a degree on this principle, on spreading its cultural will through the colonies. Fast forward to the Premier League and very few club owners are without blemish. If Manchester City really is a laundromat for the global reputation of the UAE, as Chelsea has been for Roman Abramovich, then people such as me who publicise it are just another bubble inside the drum, a soap-clogged bristle on the far edge of the scrubbing brush.And yet, there is a question of degree to all things. Whataboutery doesn’t really work here, because there has been nothing like this before, an entire club used to advertise a country, to play a part in a regional cold war of the gulf. Once you start saying, well, Ed Glazer donated to Trump, or going on about Arsenal being sponsored by the Emirates airline, you may as well just drown in moral relativism, accept that there that are no degrees of what is desirable, that “the world” is to blame for things that happen rather than the people in it who do the things.Blind tribal consumption is not really going to help here. It is vital to show some kind of inidual agency, to be more confident that a football club, which will belong to its fans even when the current age has passed, can survive some actual scrutiny. And to drag the eye away, just for a moment, from the promise of pearls, from all that disorientating underwater beauty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0896d891886a2064659645ccfbb181e2845197b2/0_66_1020_612/master/1020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11f7e45d5e5a5e87b56428d7adc3f616","title":"uk pledges 50m to end female genital mutilation by 2030","story":"Money will go to grassroots programmes across Africa in bid to protect millions of girls currently at risk of being cutThe UK government is to invest £50m in an attempt to end female genital mutilation by 2030, claiming it is the biggest single investment to tackle the issue by an international donor.The money, announced on Friday, will go to grassroots programmes working to stop the practice across Africa, where prevalence is highest. Penny Mordaunt, international development secretary, said the investment was key to also ending FGM in the UK.“Inspirational, courageous African women are leading efforts to end the practice in their own countries, and thanks to them, more communities are starting to abandon the practice.“But progress is at a critical juncture and we must work to protect the millions of girls that are still at risk of being cut. We also can’t end FGM in the UK without ending it globally.”At least 200 million girls and women have been subjected to FGM – the cutting of female genitals – and an estimated 69 million more girls will be cut over the next 12 years unless action is taken. The UN general assembly has agreed to work to end FGM by 2030 under the sustainable development goals.Brendan Wynne, from Donor Direct Action, which runs an End FGM fund, said: “Such additional funding is incredibly welcome but this time around we have to make sure that it actually reaches those women on the frontlines who are working so hard and so successfully to help end FGM. We should not tell them how to do this, but rather get behind them and support their leadership. They know what they are doing and should be trusted.”In Sudan the money will be used to expand the Saleema Initiative, set up in 2008 by the National Council for Child Welfare and Unicef Sudan. Saleema – “whole” in Arabic – runs 263 clubs at schools where girls – some who will already have been cut - discuss FGM and their rights as girls.Malak Abdulrahman al-Awad, age 15, from Um al-Qura, is an active member of the club at her school and has managed to prevent girls undergoing FGM.“I was cut and all my sisters are cut but I am an active member of the girls’ club. Everyone in my school is part of the girls’ club. We learned about the reporting of FGM and the consequences and how it is not religious.”When she heard that her cousin was to be cut, she took action: “I went and saw the midwife and saw the girl had already begun to cut the girls. There were lots of girls there who were going to be cut.“I went to my teacher. He reported this to the authorities who intervened and reported the midwife to the police,” she said.“Then I spoke to the parents of the girls who had not yet been cut and I have told them they should not cut their daughters.”Zeinab Ali, head of education in Malak’s home state of El Gezira, said clubs aim to empower girls “to have strong opinions in front of their mothers and grandmothers”, who usually make the decisions to have their daughters and granddaughters cut.One mother, Aisha Dawoud, told the  she now regretted having her only daughter cut when she was six.“My daughter was sick and some people advised me that if I cut her she will be fine. I wish I hadn’t done it. I saw the consequences of being cut on myself, because it was very hard to give birth and during my period too.“If I had another daughter, I won’t cut her,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4bdcfb3027a6fcc4813dd484438cc2f2638c337/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72adeac5714d906eef025a24cad9da2c","title":"blind date sara stu","story":"What were you hoping for?Not a lad.

I think a lot of people are like this, but maybe that’s just a thing that cowards think. So I gave open-water swimming a shot in late October – the first hint of a cold snap – in a regular swimsuit, and gave up somewhere around my ankles. I didn’t rear up against the discomfort I genuinely thought I might die. The most likely outcome was a heart attack.The insulation, for the first 20 seconds, was incredible. No prospect of a myocardial infarction at all more like getting off a bus in bracing weather. Feet and hands, sure, do your worst: but my core temperature stayed stable for at least two yards. Then the water gets into the suit, and the freeze begins, and my first experience of this entirely predictable physical event shooed me out of the water immediately. It wasn’t that I’d misunderstood the principle – a thin layer of water gets trapped between your body and your suit, warms up under contact and then keeps you warm – more that I didn’t believe in it. The next day, I gave it longer, but still not as long as two minutes.There is another principle: that you have to work up to the cold. Yet this doesn’t work like running, where you work up to 20 minutes by doing shorter runs for progressively longer. It’s more the way you adapt to the weight of a toddler, by growing your muscles imperceptibly as the kid grows: better to swim through the mild autumn into the start of winter, and build a tolerance with the season. It doesn’t work if it gets suddenly cold so I stayed focused purely on advancing chunks of seconds. Even running, out of shape, for 90 seconds and feeling the mournful weltschmerz, of how much you’ve let yourself go, cascading over the wheeze of your sorry lungs doesn’t hold a candle to this discomfort.On the plus side: it burns a lot more calories, if you can take it, than regular swimming it’s good for your libido, apparently (though seeing me climbing into the wetsuit did nothing for my Mr’s libido) and you sleep better. But that could have been the trauma.Body heat is lost 25 times faster in water than in air. For me, the wetsuit isn’t a nice-to-have, it’s essential.

I know he’s happy and healthy.”Nishi is six, and was diagnosed with a dairy allergy as a baby. Reena was already vegetarian, and had felt uneasy about eating animal products for some time. Because her baby son was now more or less vegan by default, she joined him – and today the pair are strictly plant-based. Her older son, Aarush, is eight, and, like his dad, vegetarian but considering veganism. (Both boys are currently obsessed with creating an online vegan sweetshop.)For many parents, the idea of raising children on nothing but plants is hard to fathom. Anyone who has ever struggled to make a child eat something as inoffensive as peas will probably balk at barring fish fingers (protein) and yoghurt (calcium). But the number of vegan children is on the rise in the UK. No one knows exactly how many there are the Vegan Society’s most recent figures state that there are about 600,000 vegans in the country, twice the number there were two years ago – but this figure accounts only for people aged over 15. It’s a social shift driven by health, environmental and animal welfare concerns, as well as high-profile campaigns such as Veganuary, which saw nearly 168,500 people around the world give up meat, fish, eggs, dairy and honey for four weeks last January. Since nearly half of all British vegans are aged 15-34, the Vegan Society assumes the number of vegan children must also be increasing sharply. How do their families do it?Tamar Nussbacher-Lawrence’s rather choosy three-year-old son hasn’t put her, or her husband Rob, off their newly adopted veganism. “He only wants to eat toast, rice, pasta, chips and fruit,” she says. “I do worry about it, but I try not to be a crazy food pusher – I always make sure I offer him what we have. Maybe he will eat when he’s 18,” she smiles. The couple, who run Inkwa Tattoo studio in London (Tamar is also a reflexologist), have been vegan for 18 months, partly inspired by Rob’s Rastafarianism (it’s up to the inidual, but many Rastafarians adopt an “ital” diet and don’t eat animal products). After giving up red meat for a trial period, they quickly cut out chicken, fish and dairy, and then all animal products. “We just felt better, physically and mentally. And the better we felt, the easier it was to do,” says Rob.Another powerful motivator was that, soon after, Tamar became pregnant. “We had a hard journey towards having kids,” she says. “I’m not saying, ‘Go vegan and you’ll get pregnant.’ But I specialise in fertility and maternity reflexology, and I tell my clients that, even if you improve the quality of the meat you buy and eat less of it, it will make a difference to your system.”Tamar has two stepchildren who eat meat outside the home, but not when staying over, and an eight-month-old daughter who they are weaning as a vegan. “It started when I bought some meat for my son and the next morning it was still in date but completely brown. It made me think, what am I putting down his throat?”The change startled the couple’s friends and family. “We really liked meat, and we ate and cooked a lot of it – a lot of barbecues,” says Tamar. “A few people said, ‘You’ll be back in a week’, because every meal I had, it had to have meat,” adds Rob. “My dad used to run a pop-up Jamaican restaurant in the 1990s: jerk chicken, stew pork, curry goat – every kind of animal you can think of, from cow’s foot to pig’s trotter to oxtail. So when I snapped out of that, it shocked a lot of people.”His older boys are 13 and nine, and for them there was a period of adjustment. “My kids said, ‘Can I still eat meat?’ And they can,” says Rob. “But they know there are no meat products in our house. None to come in, none to go in our microwave, or our oven or our fridge. When they step out, they can make their own choices. I don’t want them to feel shackled by my decision. I can only try and guide them through what I think is right.”“We try to make things for them that aren’t too adventurous, like spaghetti bolognese, fajitas,” says Tamar. “And curries, rice, stew peas, all the things they’re used to, but with the meat taken out,” adds Rob. “With a lot of Caribbean food, you can just extract the meat and use other ingredients. ”They have explained their choice to their boys, including the three-year-old. “I tell him we don’t eat animals, and that animals are our friends. I don’t think he’s old enough to understand on any other level. Or care, to be honest,” says Tamar.As for their eight-month-old daughter, the couple are following a baby-led weaning approach, meaning they simply give her a bit of the vegan food they are eating. “She’s still breastfed, and until she’s one, she’ll get most of her nutrition from that,” says Tamar. “I make sure she has things like almond butter, tahini and avocado. I’m doing research and getting ideas about what to feed her. With my three-year-old, we weren’t vegan, and I did all the pureeing and freezing. I’m finding this easier. I just give her a bit of toast with peanut butter and she’s happy.”Erin Marrs lives in Kirkcaldy with her husband Paul, a professional hockey player, and their two sons, Oliver, who is five, and Charles, who is 18 months old. All four are vegan the children have been “vegan since conception”, says Erin. She converted her husband, having initially given up dairy to treat her adult acne. “He was not at all eager,” she says, “but what I tell everyone to do is pick a favourite meal and then veganise that. I learned to cook because there needed to be no reason he could say, ‘I’m missing out on something.’”The more Marrs learned about animal welfare, the more it underlined her choice. “I considered myself an animal lover, but I began to learn about factory farms, about how our consumption of animals has gone crazy. Once you see it, you can’t unlearn it. Watching the documentary Forks Over Knives was very powerful, and then Earthlings, which is horrible.” Would she consider herself an activist? “I’m more of a pacifist vegan. People ask if it’s for health or for animals, and I say both.”Although both sets of grandparents are very supportive, Marrs has had some difficult conversations with friends. “I’ve definitely had some judgment. I have one girlfriend who thinks it’s too extreme. She thinks I’m not indulging enough, when I have only one life to live – like it’s a massive diet that I’m on. She will ask, ‘When is this vegan thing going to be over?’ but I just laugh it off. That kind of judgment often comes from the people who are most interested or conflicted themselves.”Marrs’ Instagram feed is full of tempting bowls of multicoloured raw vegetables and falafel, or soups bursting with carrots and greens – all of it being grabbed by tiny, pudgy toddler hands. She wrangles a series of what sound like minor miracles every day. “In the morning, they usually go for fruit, first. We make a smoothie bowl or have overnight oats. We often do leftovers for lunch, or a wrap with hummus and veggies, or a chickpea salad sandwich. And then some sort of big dinner, like a big buddha bowl with a brown rice base, tons of veggies and a sauce.”It hasn’t always been straightforward. “My eldest went through a phase where he was very picky, around two or three. If you’re feeding them a vegan diet and they’re not eating any vegetables, you panic. He would only eat fruit – an entire pineapple, or bananas all day.” Marrs worried less than she might have done, as, in common with many vegan mothers, she extended breastfeeding until Oliver was three – partly to avoid having to find a suitable alternative drink. He stopped when Marrs became pregnant again.So far, Oliver has never veered off the vegan path. “If someone gives him peanut butter on toast, he’ll ask if the bread is vegan. He’s very vocal about it and very firm in his stance. I don’t think I’ve pushed it on to him, other than explaining to him why we eat this way.“Once he was old enough to know that people ate different things, he started to ask what they were eating and we told him: that’s a cow or a chicken. If we pass the meat counter in the supermarket, he’ll say, ‘That’s a dead chicken.’ He’s been around my family for turkey dinners. He knows it was once a living animal, and he has no interest in eating one.” At another child’s birthday party, he didn’t seem to mind not eating the cake. “I just said, it’s not vegan, and he said, OK. There was a trampoline, so he couldn’t have cared less about sitting down to eat.”It’s important to Marrs that her children do get treats. “People have suggested that when he turns 16 he’s just going to go to McDonald’s and gorge. But he won’t if he doesn’t feel like he’s missing out. If he wants a vegan doughnut, we go get one.” Like Patel, Marrs receives occasional comments about her eldest’s size. “My youngest is massive, but my older son is an average height, and some people ask if he’s a little bit small. I don’t know if they think that, because he’s vegan, he’s not going to grow big and strong.”“We explained from an early age why we were vegan,” she says. “When Emily was about 10, old enough not to be upset by it, we took her to see Vegucated at a community screening.” The 2011 documentary follows three New Yorkers who go vegan while learning about intensive animal farming. “The film explains why people might be vegan in a nice, positive way, but does go into some details,” Liddle says. “While they don’t show a lot, they do show some aspects of the meat industry, like the separation of parts of animals. I remember it was so sterile – turning animals into products, picking off the legs and dealing with the corpses. It was strange and macabre.”Although on occasion, Emily has rebelled – “we find the occasional wrapper of something containing dairy, but it’s no big deal” – she has avoided non-vegan food since she was very small. “At nursery, if she was offered a sweet that wasn’t vegan, she just wouldn’t have it.”The family’s choice is motivated by a number of factors. “For me, it’s about doing the right thing. Being vegan is an important part of intersectionalism. As well as animals, health and the environment, I care about humans. If we stop being violent towards animals, maybe we will understand how to make ourselves less violent towards people.” She says she was also affected by the experience of dairy cows. “The calf is separated from the mother almost immediately. That mother doesn’t have any rights.”Today, Emily attends secondary school in the Scottish Borders, where Liddle has met with the catering staff. “We explained how, if you change just one ingredient, instead of being vegetarian it will be vegan – but everyone can still have it. Things like not putting milk in soup, or doing lentil curry instead of chicken. There are lots of other options for non-vegan kids on any given day. It just needs a tiny tweak.”For Reena Patel, her children’s school in London has been the least complicated factor in her son’s veganism. “A couple of his friends are also vegan, so he’s not the odd one out.” At home, the family all eat the same food, with small adaptations to make a meal half-vegan and half-vegetarian. “So if we’re making pizza, half will be made with non-dairy cheese.”Until he was three, Nishi was untroubled about not being able to eat at other people’s houses. “But as he’s gone to more playdates and birthday parties, he’s felt quite left out. I have to send a list of things that he can’t eat and I offer to bring food for him, but mostly people are really accommodating. I’m always so grateful – it’s not something that I expect at all.”Because of Nishi’s allergies, the family were offered support from consultants and dietitians. “I was expecting a fight, going in saying: ‘He has all these allergies and we’re vegetarian, so he’s now vegan.’ On the whole, they’ve been brilliant. Just once, a dietitian likened it to child abuse: she said ‘He has so many allergies and he’s quite small, so it’s a form of neglect.’ I had to get up and walk out. I later found out she’d been asked to leave because she was so aggressive and judgmental.”Recently, Patel discovered she was more concerned about her youngest son’s size than the professionals. “I worried he was too small, but his allergy specialist sat me down and said, ‘Stop worrying, you’re petite and the chances are he’s just naturally small. He eats well – he’s absolutely fine.’ It was hugely reassuring.”“As a parent, veganism has to be a well-informed choice. But it’s absurd we feel the need to question parents who are vegan when I see so many kids on the way home from school eating chips, sweets and fizzy drinks. People are more antsy about veganism than junk food.”Anyone raising a vegan child in the UK who wants support should get it from their GP, and if necessary, a dietitian, says Rosie Saunt, a registered NHS dietitian and co-founder of the Rooted Project, which tries to counter nutritional myths in the media. “A GP will check that a parent or  is covering the bases. But then if they are still struggling they would be referred to a dietitian, particularly if there are any red flags, like their child isn’t thriving or growing as they should be.” She has no qualms about young children being vegan as long as parents focus on “lots of variety and give it some careful thought”. In 2017, the British Dietetic Association, Britain’s professional body for dietitians, reaffirmed its 2014 agreement with the Vegan Society, stating that a well-planned vegan diet can be healthy for people of any age.“General studies of vegan diets show they are definitely healthy,” says Saunt. “There are multiple health benefits, such as lowered risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It’s difficult to find studies to back up whether they are good for general health in children, infants and adolescents. This is for a few reasons: studies on children haven’t necessarily been done, as ethically it can be difficult, and the existing data on adults can be skewed by confounding factors. Adults who follow a vegan diet tend to be of higher socioeconomic status, they tend to exercise more, and not to smoke. So it’s hard to unpick if it’s the vegan diet alone leading to these benefits in adults.”Because the vegan diet is relatively restricted, in comparison with most UK diets (the average Briton is thought to eat nearly 80 kilos of meat a year and drink 82 litres of milk), vegan adults and children need to make sure they are getting enough of certain critical nutrients. “Calcium, iron, protein, vitamin D, B12, iodine and omega 3 fatty acids” are the important ones, says Saunt. “We are lucky in the UK, as there are loads of options in the supermarkets, so it is possible for children and infants to get all the nutrition they need from a plant-based diet.”She emphasises that it’s important for children to eat a wide range of vegan foods, including nuts, seeds, beans, pulses and soya products such as tofu. “Different foods contain nutrients which all work together in a complex synergy. Since energy and nutrient requirements are higher during growth, infants and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to deficiencies. They need enough energy to grow and be active, to ensure they remain healthy, fight infection, and learn.”Some health professionals have sounded a much more cautious note. Last year Mary Fewtrell, professor of paediatric nutrition at University College London, released a strongly worded statement voicing concern that parents of vegan infants were not following advice when it came to supplements, especially of vitamin B12. As chair of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition committee, Fewtrell wrote, “It is difficult to ensure a healthy and balanced vegan diet in young infants, and parents should understand the serious consequences of failing to follow advice regarding supplementation of the diet. The risks of getting it wrong can include irreversible cognitive damage and, in the extreme, death. Our advice is that if parents pursue a vegan diet for their child, they must seek and strictly follow medical and dietary advice.” (The Vegan Society responded at the time, stating, “Nutrient deficiencies are not an exclusively vegan problem and it is unfair to paint them as such.”)Jones has two vegan siblings. “Sixteen years ago my brother, who is now in his late 20s, went vegan – if he went out, all he could eat was bean burgers from Nando’s, on repeat. My mum and dad found it very difficult, as it was so rare. But us kids have had an upwards effect on my parents. Over the years we’ve informed them and given them books, and let them know that we are going to be OK. My mum is now almost completely vegan and my dad eats steak about once a year.” Raising a vegan child is perhaps trickiest in families where no one else is even vegetarian. Jen Stanbrook, an interiors blogger based in Nottingham, has two daughters. The eldest, 14, is a strict vegan on moral and ethical grounds she doesn’t wear wool or leather and uses only cruelty-free skincare brands. “I don’t ever cook a family meal now,” Stanbrook says. “When Ella was vegetarian it was easier to add the meat or extra ingredients, but the vegan diet makes this pretty impossible. We sit down together but mostly I cook at least two, if not three, different meals. My younger daughter won’t eat anything labelled vegan, although Ella batch cooks about three quarters of her own meals now.”Some friends, colleagues and family members fail to understand why Stanbrook is so accommodating. “The initial reaction is the usual: surely that can’t be healthy, how does she get enough protein? Other people, parents usually, just say we should force her to eat meat, that she’s too young to make that kind of decision and they would never allow it in their house. But she’s passionate about her way of life. And I’m sure she has a much better, more balanced diet than a lot of her peers.”She admits she found Ella’s veganism hard at first. “It took a lot of effort from us all to make it work. I do feel sad that our family meals out are more restricted, but I am proud of Ella. She is very knowledgeable about food and nutrition. She follows her principles and wants to make a difference. It’s inspiring.”Mac and ’shews “Cheese” made with vegetables and raw cashew nuts, pureed, then baked.

Plant-based sources include wholewheat and rye, but aren’t likely to provide enough. It is found in seaweed, but the amount of iodine varies hugely in sea vegetables. It is recommended that vegans consider an iodine supplement.Vitamin B12 Children may show signs of B12 deficiency more rapidly than adults. Symptoms include low energy or appetite, or failure to thrive long-term it can lead to more permanent damage. The Vegan Society recommends that children aged one to five have a supplement or get it from fortified foods, because it is found almost exclusively in animal products. Other good sources are nutritional yeast, some dairy-free spreads and yeast extract.Omega 3 fats These are important for heart health and brain development. They are found in plants as well as animal sources, but the plant source provides a type of fatty acid which the body has to convert very slowly into the one we need. You can find it in rapeseed oil, flax seeds, hemp, chia and walnuts. There is a supplement containing the form we need, made from micro-algae but as yet, there’s not enough research about whether these supplements work.Vitamin D It is recommended that everyone in the UK takes a vitamin D supplement in winter months, whether vegan or not, because of the lack of sun. But Vitamin D3 is often made from sheep’s wool, and so isn’t vegan. You can get a version made from lichen, or choose vitamin D2.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3f7890aa77e0fea284e9cbe076bef5d060817e2/0_94_2917_1750/master/2917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25d0fe549f6903815d3f6053608051e5","title":"woman saved jewish family history housekeeper","story":"When my grandparents faced deportation to the death camps, they entrusted their beloved housekeeper with their life storyMy mother’s handwriting has always been challenging. I’m used to deciphering it by now, but for her two teenage granddaughters, new correspondence means a fresh, code-breaking session. So it wasn’t unexpected to read recently the advice that an earlier generation gave her: “Your handwriting is really bad. That surprises me, as you are normally so skilful with your hands, you even knit well. Try writing some time with a very soft nib, then you won’t have to press so hard. And make your writing a little bigger. It might be a good idea to use a thicker pen.”It’s an attentive, but otherwise unremarkable passage. What’s startling, though, is the letter’s context. For this calm, measured instruction was written in late January 1942, at a time when its author, my maternal grandmother, Margarete Oppenheimer, was in mortal danger as a Jew enduring the living nightmare of Nazism, trying to navigate her daily life in the face of insuperable odds. By then, she and her husband, Moritz, had survived seven years trapped in Hitler’s Germany, and 14 months in appalling conditions in French internment camps. What is also remarkable is how the letter – and others that amount to a family history plucked from the destruction of the Holocaust – came to be in my mother’s possession. And it’s all thanks to one very remarkable woman: the family’s housekeeper.In the very week when senior government officials and SS leaders met in Wannsee to coordinate the logistical task of exterminating millions of other European Jews, my grandmother, by contrast, chose to focus on a solution to the awful handwriting of one of her far-flung offspring. It’s not that she didn’t know what was happening all around her. She knew it far too well. Her rebuke to the suffocating insanity was to keep sending – somehow – thoughtful, loving letters out of the maelstrom. Those few that arrived proved a lifeline to her six frightened children, by then scattered across three continents.In some respects, my mother, Ruth David, had a fortunate childhood. Her devoted parents were happily married and comfortably off. Her father was the main employer in Fränkisch-Crumbach, the village south of Frankfurt where they grew up. The family even had a housekeeper, Mina.When, just under a year after Ruth was born, my grandmother gave birth again, it was Mina who helped out, looking after Ruth lovingly and spoiling her rotten. The two grew to have a special bond that the other siblings envied. For years, she was like a second mother. But almost all Ruth’s childhood memories are shaped by the fact that she was only four when Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933. As seemingly inconsequential acts of humiliation turned into systematic deprivation, fear became despair. When the order came, via the town crier, that Aryans were no longer allowed to work for Jews, Mina, one of the few Catholics in the village, did her best to ignore it. When my grandfather, Moritz, tried to send her away (difficult, because she had no other home), she refused to go. Eventually, for her own protection, she was forced to leave.No wonder Ruth retains such vivid memories of her childhood trauma. Eighty years ago, as a nine-year-old, she survived the horrors of Kristallnacht. Her village was such a rural backwater that the destruction came a day late. But it was still ferocious. And Mina was no longer there to protect her. At its end, Ruth’s father and brother were dragged to Buchenwald, the family home left ransacked, and her disabled uncle thrown down the stairs in his wheelchair. Emerging from hiding, she found her mother standing alone in their ruined pantry. Its preserved contents, their lifeline for the winter months, lay smashed on the floor, liquids oozing red through heaps of broken glass.Half a year later, she was on the Kindertransport, about to begin a new life in England. Her parents had promised they would see her again, but it was a necessary fiction they died in Auschwitz in August 1942 while Ruth grew up in a refugee hostel in the Lake District under the brutal tutelage of two Viennese matrons. Keeping in touch by letter became increasingly difficult as the war progressed.Yet remarkably, for the last three years of their lives, some of my grandparents’ letters continued to make it out – intermittently – until only days before they were forced into a cattle truck and transported to Poland to be gassed. Until the start of the war, their correspondence was direct, but soon it had to be sent via third countries, first via a schoolfriend in neutral Holland, then another friend in Lithuania. Both these Jewish acquaintances were murdered once their countries were occupied. Many of the letters never made it through but, looking back, my mother thinks she could not have survived without the ones that did.After the war, once she learned of her parents’ fate, she wanted nothing more to do with Germany. But, in the late 1950s, two of her English friends persuaded her to return, sensing it was key to her recovery. Their genius was to have tracked down the family’s former housekeeper, Mina, the only German Ruth longed to see again.My mother barely recognised the old woman, but the two flew together, embraced, hugged tightly and sobbed, rooted to the spot. Mina took my mother back to her little attic bedroom and passed her something she had kept faithfully for years. An old lever-arch file, with the word “Kinder” on the spine, written in my grandfather’s elegant cursive.It was an archival treasure trove. On the early morning of 22 October 1940, the first major deportation of Jews from the Reich began. My grandparents had one hour to dress quickly, pack a suitcase and assemble at Mannheim station. The plan was secret, yet Mina had heard the news. Not only did she risk arrest by once again meeting my grandparents, she even begged to travel with them into the unknown. Instead, at the last moment, they had thrust an old file filled with letters into her arms and told her to keep it safe until she could hand it over to one of their children. Now, 20 years later, she was making good on her promise.At first the file’s contents were too painful for my mother to read. It contained all the letters she and her siblings had sent their parents during the war, but also carbon copies of all her parents’ letters to them, up until their first deportation. The ones sent to their elder sons in Argentina and the US, many of which had never arrived, outline their emigration plans and are a detailed account of their early exile.Inside the binder, her family still lived. The detail in the lost letters allowed her to reconstruct and imagine her parents’ restricted existence. When they wrote to their younger children, they were careful to limit themselves to scraps of reassuring information. But they felt free to write to their older sons more openly, or as much as they dared under the censors’ prying eyes. There was still no mention of the constant house searches of Jewish homes, the hunger, the cold, or the all-pervasive fear. But they did share their struggles: her mother had responsibility for a house full of Jewish orphans, her father at first made unceasing efforts to resuscitate his business, and then to sell it for a price that he hoped would secure him and his wife places on a ship’s passage out.Once war broke out, they had no resources left. Yet even then there was an occasional triumph. In a hostile land, some of her father’s friendships endured and one of these meant he secured residential care for his disabled brother and sister in an old people’s home. But it was a temporary reprieve. My mother’s aunt and uncle also died in concentration camps before the war’s end.Many Kinder believe that their parents gave them life twice, once when they were born, and again when they were sent away to safety. But Mina, too, passed over the gift of life in that lever-arch file. Its contents have allowed my mother to piece together a shattered past, and to pursue her own work on Holocaust education, work that has brought thousands of people face-to-face with the very personal nature of this catastrophe. And it has meant that I can sit with her, now, in the autumn of 2018, trying to decipher the words she wrote to her parents one lifetime ago.

Could the answer be to put ourselves out there more? We challenged standup Tessa Coates to find outWhen asked if I’d take on a week of challenges designed to help me open up my life to others, I saw “throw a dinner party” on the list of activities and said yes without reading the fine print. That, friends, is how I found myself running with a gang of overly enthusiastic joggers to an allotment on a dark Monday night, weeding a vegetable patch, and then running back.I wanted to learn something about myself during my week of sharing challenges. Reader, I learned that, while I am too often a cynical husk of a woman, I can be rehabilitated. And if I can, you can.Challenge one was at the Castle Canteen at the Crossway Christian Centre in Elephant and Castle, where volunteers make a free lunch once a week for anyone who wants it, from donated surplus food. Unquestionably a wonderful project, I was absolutely dreading it my catering experience starts and ends at being told off for eating the canapés and being sent home for backchat, while my volunteering experience starts and ends at being told off for not listening during the safety talk – and then being sent home for backchat. I had a heavy heart.To my delight, the Castle Canteen is run by a brilliant lady named Emily, who’s a professional chef. Nobody sent me home and everyone said I did a good job chopping the mange tout. When our lunch guests started to file in, my unsociable side wanted to stay at my chopping board. If I wasn’t there as part of a challenge, I might well have. But I forced myself to go out and find a seat, wondering how to find common ground.“Hello lovely lady, you’re new, what’s your name?” was the immediate greeting. A fantastic woman called Stella had me laughing in minutes, introducing me to a teacher, a musician and an ex-jockey. Conversation flowed, everybody had a story. It pulled at my heartstrings to see people light up with someone to talk to.That evening, I met a group of 30, all running with the social fitness group GoodGym, to help out with a gardening project. You meet for a run, do half an hour’s work, and then run back. The cynic in me was wearing away, fast. Who was I to make sassy comments when there are people out there trying to do something genuinely good?Next, I put a note under my neighbours’ door asking if they’d like to come round for some wine. Not the ones downstairs – we’d had an altercation over a plant pot 18 months ago and no one’s gotten over it – but the ones above. I explained the challenge, which made things less awkward, and next minute they were all round, new baby in tow. Suddenly we’re all laughing at the kitchen table, as if we lived in some kind of Mediterranean utopia.The dinner party, to which I was supposed to invite people from different parts of my life, made me very anxious. I rarely mix friends because I am not a natural hostess, and get so nervous that people won’t have a nice time that I inevitably ensure they don’t. But I swallowed down my whirlwind of nerves, invited friends who’d never met each other, gave them a glass of wine, and listened to them talking while I tried not to burn myself in the kitchen. “Why have we never met before?” they kept shouting at me. Honestly, I don’t know.I’ve realised that it’s easier to roll your eyes at the back than it is to get involved, but not nearly as fun. If we dig deeper, there’s probably something in there about fearing rejection. Regardless, I’m officially taking off my big cynical hat.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left. Finally, coat with a thin topping of breadcrumbs: this grabs any remaining moisture to stop the sponge going soggy. Set this fruity construction aside.Now, make the sponge. Into a mixing bowl, place your butter. If it isn’t already really soft, stick it in the microwave until it’s just-about-melted-but-not-quite. If you’re snobbish enough not to own a\u0026nbspmicrowave, stick the bowl of butter over a bowl of hot-not-boiling water.Once the butter is very soft, add in your sugar and give them a quick stir together with a wooden spoon. Don’t bother creaming them. Once combined, add in your egg and give the mix a beat until it’s smooth. Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible.

This unique ownership structure has safeguarded our editorial independence since 1936, and means any profits we make are reinvested in our journalism. It also means that unlike other news organisations, we haven’t put up a paywall, so we can keep our journalism open and accessible for everyone. But with print advertising revenues in decline and the majority of new digital advertising spend going by tech companies, we also need supporters, like you, who believe in the value of independent, investigative journalism. Your support is critical for the long-term sustainability of the .Being supported by readers means that we must focus on the stories that are most meaningful to society: serious reporting that takes time and effort, carefully uncovers the facts, holds the powerful to account, and interrogates ideas and arguments – journalism that speaks to the urgency of the moment, but lasts for more than a day.In the last few years we have experienced a dramatic undermining of the business model for serious journalism, as well as a series of political and social shocks, from the EU referendum result to the election of Donald Trump, and what many believe is an unprecedented level of disruption to our planet, our nation states, our communities, ourselves.The support of our readers has enabled us to pursue quality, investigative journalism which has resulted in huge global scoops such as the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook scandal – uncovered by Carole Cadwalladr, who writes for our sister paper the Observer – and about the use of people’s data in political campaigns. In addition, the Windrush revelations gave a voice to the Commonwealth citizens who have been in the UK for decades but subjected to terrible indignities because they had no paperwork.We have also continued to build on the ’s proud tradition of progressive journalism by increasing our focus on the environment, committing to reporting on inequality, exposing offshore tax avoidance through both the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers, and investigating the behaviour and employment practices of corporations in a globalised world.We believe, through the support of our readers, that we have a profound opportunity to connect with each other and experience – first hand – the stories that are shaping all of our lives, and to collaborate as we work towards a better, more informed future.At the , we are committed to holding the powerful to account and covering stories that would otherwise be ignored, and, we hope, helping to build a fairer world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8531f8a493f3b1a38ac8153db248f690532b30d9/664_424_5312_3187/master/5312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58253ce24727dc5af1ed10e41a146b8b","title":"today in focus guardian daily podcast new host","story":"The host of the ’s new daily podcast and her team aim to inject originality and heart into the news agendaI was on maternity leave when I decided to leave my role as joint political editor to present Today in Focus – the ’s new daily podcast. I was gutted to stop working alongside my amazing job-share, Heather Stewart, but excited to find myself back at our headquarters in King’s Cross.The new team was placed on a bank of desks on the second floor, close to the Observer newsroom, where colleagues I’d worked with for eight years before leaving for the parliamentary lobby in 2009 are still beavering away. On our other side are (usefully!) the lawyers and the sports desk, followed by global development writers, and a strengthened environment team.Then – just two minutes around the corner – is the newsdesk, where the volume rises as editors gather around desks to make quick, collective decisions on rolling stories.Given our aim is to showcase  and Observer journalism by telling its stories in a fresh and engaging way, sitting in the middle of two newsrooms feels like the perfect location. Meanwhile, we can turn to the reporting teams in the US and Australia, foreign correspondents in Europe, Africa and Asia and some of the best opinion writers in the world.As for the podcast itself, our central aim is to provide listeners with 20 minutes every day that never scrimps on storytelling but is anchored in the news agenda.To achieve that, the  has built a team that feels unique: because it brings together radio documentary makers with news junkies like me. That mix of skills and ideas has lent itself to an incredibly creative team in which everyone is learning a huge amount.And I’ve been really pleased with the pieces that combination of strengths has resulted in already – focusing on interesting news ideas, but telling them in a narrative, audio-rich way that we hope to develop over time. The first few episodes have been well received and have already given us good ideas on what works well.The most exciting thing has been quickly realising the scale of the talent we have to draw on here at the . Having covered politics for many years, I already knew there were excellent reporters in domestic policy areas such as the ’s Patrick Butler, an expert on universal credit, and – of course – Heather and her team in Westminster, with whom we have covered the fast-moving story of Brexit. However, I had not worked with foreign correspondents such as Tom Phillips and Bethan McKernan, whose takes on the election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and the war in Yemen combined excellent analysis with powerful and emotional stories from the ground.The format has also allowed us to be experimental, whether that means interviews with external figures such as the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, or spending a day racing around Westminster to give a behind-the-scenes feel on a huge day for news.My co-presenter, India Rakusen, has done powerful episodes: one on poverty in Britain and another on the legacy of the Iraq war, for which Peter Beaumont was able to record for the podcast on the ground.The fact that not many others are producing similar content in the UK means that Today in Focus is inevitably a work in progress in every respect, from the subjects we choose and people we interview to the workflow we follow to get the product completed each day.The overall hope is to bring  stories, told by its reporters alongside their writing, to a wider, younger and more erse audience. And our position, at the centre of a values-based organisation whose global voice has been amplified in the face of political shocks such as the elections of Donald Trump and Brexit, make that something I believe we can achieve.Being based in the  means we can be more credible than many of the websites cheerleading for their favoured politicians, but far more spiky than the BBC. Where the Today programme tries to give you headlines, we want to give you heart.We hope to offer a mix of immediate news stories, looked at from fresh angles, alongside deep es into major, rolling stories. Then there is an opinion section, where we will hear from  and Observer regulars as well as other voices from outside the building.For me, it’s a bit of a dream job, isn’t it? I get to sit in a studio day after day, discussing really interesting topics with the best journalists in the world, and working alongside some of the best young producers in the country to find new ways to present them. So far, in pilots and for real episodes, I’ve been discussing everything you can imagine, from Trump to Theresa May, the refugee crisis to Brexit, plastics to cocaine.And I’ve already experienced how differently you get to engage with your audience through a podcast. Along with Heather, I’ve been presenting Politics Weekly for the past two years, and I’ve always loved hearing from listeners who say they feel closer to my reporting when presented in that way.Today in Focus is going to be a bit experimental as we try things out with format, style and tone. In time, we will find the voice that we believe works best for us and as a platform for the .

Nearly all the bosses of the big banks are male. About 26,000 of the 31,000 iniduals regulated to give financial advice are male. Yet the reality is that men, in general, are not that good at investing.Why? Because men are too emotional. They don’t focus. They buy the latest trend. Above all, they are inclined to be just too darn risky.How do we know this? (OK, I slightly over-egged it.) Because of a fascinating study by Warwick Business School, which looked at the habits of men and women who trade shares and funds using Barclays’ Smart Investor service.So what were the men in the study doing wrong, and what were the women doing right?The biggest difference was in the type of shares that men like to buy. Too many men get excited about the potential for lottery-style winnings from highly speculative shares or instruments that appear cheap but which can soar in value.So in the past they probably bought penny shares in Turkmenistan oil companies because, you know, they’re a dead-cert “ten bagger”. The same fools today buy initial coin offerings believing them to be the next bitcoin. Good luck on that one.And men have problems dealing with things that go wrong. One of the worst mistakes in investing is to hold on to shares after they have ed, in the hope that they’ll recover. Women are more likely to cut their losses, men hold on – to see their shares shrivel to nothing.Then there’s emotionality. It appears that men are more sensitive to news events than women, and are more likely to buy and sell as a result. But one thing we’ve learned in recent years is that high levels of trading tends to diminish returns. The study found that the female investors traded nine times a year on average, while for men it was 13.Neil Stewart, the Warwick Business School professor who led the analysis, says: “Men are just a little more likely to be drawn to more speculative stocks, whereas women are more likely to focus on shares that already have a good track record. Women also take a more long-term perspective, trading less frequently. This possibly means women are investing more to support their financial goals, whereas men are attracted to what they see as the thrill of investing.”The research was a snapshot of the behaviour of 2,800 investors over a 36-month period, so make of that what you will.Having been burned by a speculative investment in oil exploration companies a decade ago, I learned my lesson and now invest almost entirely through cheap index funds. But I still play at asset allocating between what I regard as expensive or cheap markets. Right now, UK domestically focused equities look screamingly cheap, priced for a no-deal Brexit when such a daft outcome is highly unlikely. But I could well be wrong. After all, I am a man."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b1b0b030388f37da79e636399c3334e2ac23382/142_469_5618_3371/master/5618.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74be70d83752e584b6c23c36d5b75ddd","title":"work night shifts sainsburys university living costs loan","story":"Micheal Olorode, 21, on how he has funded his way through university without a loanName Micheal OlorodeAge 21Income £12,000Occupation Studying to become NHS physiotherapistI’m a student in my fourth year of a biomedical science degree at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, but I also work 38 hours a week at Sainsbury’s to make ends meet. I do three night shifts a week, plus overtime if I can get it. Monday is the most hectic day for me – I work from 10pm until 8am on Saturday and Sunday nights, earning just over £100 a night, and then I have to be at my first lecture at 9am on Monday. By the time I finish lectures, at 2pm, I’m very tired, but I know I have to be back at work by 10pm.I am constantly having to force myself to stay awake, and to be alert, whatever it takes. A packet of Skittles and a Red Bull usually helps. The work I do at Sainsbury’s is very physical – stacking shelves, bringing new products out onto the shop floor. I’m lucky because I’m an active person and the amount I lift at work is nothing compared with the weights I lift in the gym. I know I have the strength to bear it.Unfortunately, even though I had applied for “settled” British residential status when I was very young, the Home Office waited until I was in sixth form to approve my application. That meant I wasn’t eligible for a student loan. The only way I could afford to go to university was if I got a job that would pay all my living costs and my parents, who work in market research, stumped up my tuition fees. In Scotland, that’s about £7,000 a year.It isn’t the best situation to be in, but I have had to make the best of it and my parents are doing everything they can to help me. They have taken on extra hours at work and got a loan from the bank. They find a way, always, to help me when I need it. I worry about them, though. They are getting old and they have my two siblings to look after as well. They try not to show me the strain they are under, but I know.Most of the money I earn goes on my rent: £500 a month. My other monthly costs include £100 on utility bills, £65 on phone and broadband, £24 on gym membership and £125 on car insurance. I pay for all of that myself. I also spend £80 a month on food – I shop around and cook myself big batches of meals.I don’t have much time to socialise because of my job. Ideally, I would also like to have more time to study so I can excel at my course. But complaining is pointless. Yes, I have a lot on my plate, but working hard isn’t new to me. Growing up, my parents and my mentors in the church and at GT Scholars instilled in me the importance of working hard for what you want in life.My dream is to do an MA in physiotherapy next year and then get a job working for the NHS. But right now, I’m just focused on trying to get the best grades I can. Whenever I find life hard, I tell myself this is about my future. I don’t need much, but I would like to worry less about money and have more free time. That is what I look forward to the most.As told to Donna Ferguson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa1df82aba115621731b7d9b37541631baa770f9/226_0_4184_2511/master/4184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05ce448ea39c267bedab31c7aa1cfa68","title":"clean bandit britains biggest pop group","story":"The band’s reliance on star vocalists means ‘most people don’t know much about us’. But it turns out they’re more politically vocal than most pop phenomenaSequestered in the corner of an east London restaurant, Clean Bandit are having a hard time describing their fans. “Age-wise, it’s very broad,” says cellist, producer, and de facto front-person Grace Chatto. “It doesn’t feel like it’s any particular type of person – it’s just a big group of, er, random people,” laughs producer Jack Patterson. With a frankly ludicrous 4bn global streams making them one of the UK’s most successful bands, their difficulty in finding a neat catch-all is pretty understandable.In accordance with modern pop rules, these fans have given themselves a collective noun – “fandits” – and while Grace is adamant that they’re “really nice” and “don’t battle with other fandoms”, Patterson is reminded of a more sinister experience. “This one fan wrote to all my friends saying she had a dark secret about me,” he says, pushing the dregs of a caesar salad around his plate. “Then she sent a photo that was meant to be proof of something,” laughs his brother Luke, the group’s drummer. “But it wasn’t even you.”It is a telling anecdote from a band who have maintained near anonymity (Jack says he often gets mistaken for the tennis player Andy Murray) in the face of huge success. Their 2014 Jess Glynne-assisted, Grammy-winning Rather Be alchemised the band’s fusion of classical and handbag house into a million-selling single, spending four weeks at No 1 and gatecrashing the US Top 10. It was followed by four more Top 10 singles and then, in 2016, by Rockabye’s ludicrous conjoining of dancehall, a near 400-year-old nursery rhyme and Sean Paul rapping about single mums. It spent nine weeks at No 1 in the UK and took the Christmas top spot. Rockabye features on their restlessly inventive second album What Is Love?, which, as well as containing two more chart-toppers (string-drenched weepie Symphony, featuring Zara Larsson, and the juddery electro of Solo alongside Demi Lovato), also comes with a genre-agnostic, Spotify-friendly gaggle of collaborators, from Ellie Goulding to Stefflon Don, via Craig David, Rita Ora and Outkast’s Big Boi.The group have spearheaded a new kind of Avengers-style pop, with multiple star turns helping lesser-known artists such as Benny Blanco, Jonas Blue and Tiësto to the upper reaches of the charts. But Clean Bandit remain ultimately reliant on the mercurial pizzazz of proper pop stars front of house, so what are people’s perceptions of them as a band? “They don’t have any perceptions,” says Grace. “I still feel like most people don’t know much about us,” shrugs Luke.While the perception is that Clean Bandit arrived seemingly fully formed and focus-grouped with Rather Be, they enjoyed the early hustle, gigging constantly and hosting their own club night, National Rail Disco. Back in London, it was Grace who would constantly harangue MTV to ask why it wasn’t playing the self-directed video for Mozart’s House. When she was told it would only play it once the song had some traction on radio, she found a radio plugger and gave him the equivalent of a month’s rent in cash. “We couldn’t even afford to get the tube at that point,” she remembers. “Within a few weeks, Radio 1 was playing it and then, all of a sudden, all these lawyers and managers contacted us.”They signed to a major label, Atlantic Records, in 2012 and the re-released Mozart’s House peaked at No 17 a year later. For a while, before the success of Rather Be, they planned to focus solely on making videos and started a production company called Clean Film in 2011. “Shooting videos is the most intense, full-body experience,” beams Grace. “It’s almost like a ritualistic, sadomasochistic process that we have to put ourselves through after every song’s finished,” adds Jack. “We have to self-flagellate and punish ourselves.”That’s not to say they have avoided controversy altogether. In fact, Mozart’s House cost Grace her pre-fame job. “I was teaching cello in a school and some of the kids found the video and the parents complained that it was inappropriate,” she says, referencing a section where she strolls through a car park with a violin covering her bare chest. “That notion that female skin is somehow dirty or inappropriate for children is such a bad message.” She says she was also determined to keep a scene of her masturbating in the video for Solo. “I had kickback from the label saying: ‘What if children ask their parents what’s going on?’ And I was like: ‘Well, that’s fine, if they do ask their mums, then they won’t find out from other things on the internet.’ Those scenes were important for me to put in because seeing women masturbating is not something that happens in popular culture, unless it’s with a hetero male gaze.”In October 2016, violinist Amin-Smith quit. While Grace seems genuinely sad when I ask if they had any idea he was unhappy (“He always loved doing lots of other things,” she says), she is more robust when it comes to a tweet he posted in July that criticised an interview she gave about the band’s decision to play in Israel. “I find musicians and DJs pulling out of performances there a self-defeating act,” she says. “I’m not really sure what they hope to achieve and the suggestion that playing in a country means you support the political or foreign policy of that country is ridiculous, especially if you’re not willing to play there but play in America or the UK. Me wanting to play in Israel is not me making a statement about what’s going on there.”An early version of Rockabye featured vocals by the Norwegian singer Ina Wroldsen, who had written the song about her young son under the impression that she would be the featured artist. Somewhere along the line she was swapped for label mate Anne-Marie. “That was taken out of our hands,” says Jack. “It was a terrible situation and I fought with people for a couple of months and in the end there was nothing we could do,” adds Grace. They are keen to reiterate it wasn’t anything to do with Anne-Marie herself (“She’s one of our favourite singers at the moment”), but the fallout almost led to Grace quitting the band. “I did feel like I couldn’t do it any more because the idea that my business was hurting people … that was really painful. I went completely crazy for a while after that.

They’re still not sufficient and that’s why Spain is maintaining its veto over the Brexit deal.”Spain does not have a formal veto over the 585-page withdrawal agreement and the accompanying political declaration on the future relationship, but the EU would be unlikely to go ahead without its support.Sanchez said that he would attend if acceptable guarantees on Gibraltar were put in place before the summit. Asked whether he would only attend the meeting if a deal was reached in advance, Sánchez echoed his government’s earlier suggestions that the summit could yet be postponed.“And we have a promise, a commitment, from the British government willing to clarify the interpretation of article 184. The clarification that we have been asking for for days.”Article 184 states that there will be negotiations to define the future EU-UK relationship.Aguiriano added: “Therefore, we are waiting to see that statement in writing. We have demanded that they make it public before the European council, and as soon as we have that declaration and that commitment in writing, the minister and then the president will have to decide.”A spokesman for the British government denied Aguiriano’s claims. He said: “Of course we have not agreed to exclude Gibraltar. The prime minister has been consistently clear that we intend to negotiate future agreements on behalf of all territories for whose external relations we are responsible, including Gibraltar.”With the political temperature rising on the Gibraltar issue, it also emerged on Friday that the EU plans to pile further pressure on May at the Brexit summit by declaring that the post-Brexit negotiations over fishing rights in UK waters would build on the current arrangements hated by the British fishing industry.A leaked draft statement, due to be published and agreed by the EU’s leaders at the summit, says it expects such a deal to be agreed by July 2020, and that it must protect the current rights of European fishing fleets to exploit British waters.It goes on to declare that a failure by the British government to come to an agreement could jeopardise any hope of extending the transition period.Such an extension is likely to be needed by Britain’s government to allow comprehensive trade talks to develop and to avoid the backstop arrangements for Northern Ireland kicking in, which would see a regulatory border drawn between it and the rest of the UK.May has insisted “the fisheries agreement is not something we will be trading off against any other priorities”, but the 26-page political declaration published on Thursday makes a clear link between European access to British waters and the terms of a wider economic deal.The leaked EU statement, to be issued by the 27 heads of state and government, goes even further. The document, which also asserts the EU’s intention to keep the UK “dynamically aligned” to its environment policies, including its climate change targets under the Paris 2030 accord, says the EU “will demonstrate particular vigilance on the necessity to maintain ambitious level playing field conditions and to protect fishing enterprises and their communities”.It also says: “As recalled in the withdrawal agreement, a fisheries agreement is a matter of priority and should build on, inter alia, existing reciprocal access and quota shares.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08ffd99838751a5b980f1be5f88d8dd0358d3000/0_14_4110_2466/master/4110.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e64fb24c9c1e4758500c34a408599035","title":"theresa may accused of giving knighthood to win mps brexit support","story":"Former minister John Hayes has been reluctant to back PM’s deal in recent weeksTheresa May has been accused of bringing the honours system into disrepute after handing a knighthood to a former minister known to be wavering on whether or not to support her Brexit deal.Downing Street announced the award had been granted to John Hayes MP, a junior minister to May when she was the home secretary, on Friday afternoon.“People will rightly look at this knighthood and wonder how it relates to the looming Brexit vote in the Commons,” said a spokesman for the Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon.“That ‎brings the honours system into disrepute. But, more fundamentally, it exposes how broken the whole Westminster system is.”The shadow cabinet secretary, Chris Matheson, also criticised the move, saying it would be a “spectacular act of desperation for Theresa May to be giving away knighthoods in a bid to win votes for her botched Brexit deal”.He added: “This stinks of cronyism from the prime minister. We need to know if anything has been promised in exchange for this honour.”Chris Green, a Conservative MP who followed the former Brexit and foreign secretaries, David Davis and Boris Johnson, in resigning from his Department for Transport job over May’s Chequers plan in July, told the Financial Times: “They will use whatever patronage is available to them. They are feeling the heat.”Will Dry, the co-founder of the Our Future, Our Choice anti-Brexit campaign group that focuses on younger people, highlighted the strength of Tory opposition to the prime minister’s Brexit deal. He said: “If this is May’s plan to win them round, will a knighthood mean anything by the time this Brexit mess is all over?”Hayes, 60, the MP for the Lincolnshire constituency South Holland and the Deepings, has been vocal about his discomfort with the deal.A week ago, he told his local paper, the Spalding : “Whilst I can live with much of this agreement, I have been clear that we must look again at the transition arrangements and how they end.”He added that he hoped May would listen to Tory opposition and come up with a deal that he found more acceptable.May was critical of the former prime minister, David Cameron, for handing out numerous honours as he left office in 2016. She has been quoted as saying she “retched” when she saw the list.Responding to the allegations against May on Friday, a Downing Street spokesman highlighted that Hayes had said he remained undecided on the deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47abade6e5e2bb107d206d503019614bec2d3fae/0_288_4320_2591/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4208576fa7d594403618e8a0314fd482","title":"pro brexit adviser admits uk would be better off staying in eu","story":"Shanker Singham is ‘frustrated’ by PM’s failure to pursue an independent trade policyThe man relied on by Brexit supporters to underpin the economic arguments for leaving the EU has said the UK would be better off staying in the club rather than accepting the prime minister’s Brexit plan.Shanker Singham admitted “there’s no point leaving the EU” because the opportunities he had envisaged will have been lost. “The upside and the opportunity … disappears, and you’re left only with a damage limitation exercise,” he said.His remarks, made in an interview before the prime minister announced her proposed EU deal, echo those made by the former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, who on Friday told the BBC’s Today programme that May’s proposal was inferior to EU membership. They follow statements from other senior Brexit-supporting MPs including Iain Duncan Smith and Boris Johnson conceding the same point.“I’m not going to advocate staying in the EU but if you just presented me terms, this deal or EU membership – we’d effectively be bound by the same rules without a control or voice over them – yes, I think this would be even worse than that,” Raab said.Singham repeated his concerns in an email on Friday. “From a trade policy perspective this is a worse situation than being in the EU,” he wrote.Singham was also invited to a committee of experts on trade by international trade secretary Liam Fox — he later resigned to join the lobbying firm Grayling - and controversially held multiple unminuted meetings with former DExEU minister and anti-EU campaigner Steve Baker.However, his views have been rubbished by other experts and his credentials have been under scrutiny. Singham agreed to be interviewed after the  challenged him over what appeared to be exaggerated descriptions of his academic and professional record.He has been widely described as an economist though he does not have an academic degree in the subject. A Facebook profile says he studied law and economics at Oxford. However, his degree there was in chemistry and he completed postgraduate law courses at other institutions. Singham said he did create the profile but had not used it for many years.A biography of Singham distributed by a former employer in the US described his work as “assisting governments in the early privatisations during the Thatcher administration …” and Singham has mentioned his work on privatisations in the 1980s in a public speech.However, Singham’s career did not begin until 1992, two years after Thatcher left power. Singham denied that this could be misinterpreted and said the privatisation was ongoing in nature. He added that he worked on UK privatisation issues, including relating to water and gas, from 1993 to 1995. He said he had not signed off the former employer’s biography.“I have worked hard over the last 25 years to build up a career in trade and competition policy that is second to none,” he said.He said he was “deeply frustrated” by the prime minister’s decision to effectively ignore his proposals. “I see there are huge opportunities and I also see them just disappearing,” he said.He argued that failure to pursue an independent trade policy for the UK defeated the purpose of leaving the EU. “I think the prime minister genuinely believes that her proposals preserve an independent trade and regulatory policy, and I think she’s wrong,” he said.Singham also criticised the government for suggesting Brexit would be painless and without disruption to the UK’s existing relationships. Similar suggestions have been made by pro-Brexit campaigners.Singham is currently director of international trade and competition policy at the Institute of Economic Affairs, a free market thinktank that has attracted controversy for refusing to identify its financial backers.Earlier this year, Unearthed, an investigations unit set up by Greenpeace, covertly recorded footage which appeared to show the IEA’s chief executive Mark Littlewood offering to arrange meetings with cabinet ministers to potential US donors.According to the footage, Singham arranged for a businessman and a lobbyist to meet Baker when he was Brexit minister at the IEA’s offices. They also met Jacob Rees-Mogg with Singham at a meeting in parliament of the European Research Group of anti-EU MPs. The IEA says it observes all fundraising rules for charities and has denied any wrongdoing.Before joining the IEA, Singham worked at another thinktank, the Legatum Institute. He departed after the charity commission required the institute to take down one of his reports on Brexit, which it deemed to have crossed a line into political campaigning.Singham and the IEA both fiercely deny that their work constitutes lobbying. “If I wanted to just lobby for client interests, then I would have stayed being a partner in a law firm,” Singham said.While he has many supporters, Singham has critics who say he does not grasp how tough trade negotiations really are. David Henig, a civil servant who worked for seven years until recently as a trade expert for the British government and as an intermediary between the EU and the US, said he thought Singham’s proposals contained “a bit of knowledge and an awful lot of bluster, lots of technical language that doesn’t add up to anything particularly”.Singham reluctantly voted remain because he thought the disruption caused by departure would be too great. The result of the referendum was, however, “a massive global event”, providing an opportunity to kickstart stalled global free trade talks.Privately educated at St Paul’s School in London before studying at Balliol College in Oxford, Singham left university with a third class degree in chemistry. His true passion was athletics. “That literally was all I cared about,” he says. “I think if I’d done any subject it would have been the same.” After rupturing both achilles tendons (“my body was not designed to run as fast as I was trying to make it run”) he was forced to rethink his future and alighted on a career in the law.His main preoccupation is removing regulations that he says are used as barriers to trade, such as some of the EU rules on food safety, chemicals and pharmaceuticals licensing, and caps on financial services. Trade justice campaigners such as Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, have described his proposals as “pure shock doctrine”, outlining a neoliberal agenda to break rules designed to protect the public, privatise welfare services including the NHS and remove post-crash curbs on finance.Singham sees it differently, arguing that liberalised markets create opportunity and that free trade can restore faith in liberal democracy. “If we can’t say to people ‘we can protect you from competition that is unfair’,” he says, “they will choose a protectionist, populist leader to protect them from everything. That is why they elected Donald Trump, I think. That is why populism in Europe is so strong. And arguably you could say that is part of the reason for the Brexit vote.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d5b7aa902c09d127be4b19e856e5698c06b3f1/0_137_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f81db1d43cd675bc3656c51831bfadf","title":"major tim peak reveals what ground control wants in an astronaut","story":"The British space pioneer on what it takes to pass the toughest job interviewThe astronaut selection process at the European Space Agency is unforgiving from the start. On day one, candidates assemble in Hamburg for six rounds of tests that run back to back, with 10-minute breaks in between. All are designed to expose weaknesses in people’s “hard skills”: their mental arithmetic, visual perception, working memory, pattern recognition, concentration, and more. Most are abilities that cannot be taught.“On the first day of testing you are so exposed. There is no hiding place,” says Tim Peake, an army major and former helicopter test-pilot who became Britain’s first ESA astronaut in 2009. “They are analysing your brain and you’ve either got it or you haven’t. I was more nervous about that stage than anything else.”1. You are in a lunar vehicle and have to get back to base. The trip normally takes 9 hours at 72kmh, but you must get their sooner. How long will the trip take if you travel 8kmh faster? You have one minute and cannot use a calculator.2. You are facing a cube that has a spot on the bottom. In your mind, roll the cube forward, right, right, forward, left, backwards, left. Where is the dot now?3.

Do you:a) Go for a run on the treadmill instead?b) Speak with mission control to reschedule your activities?c) Interrupt the other crew member’s exercise session to discuss the matter?d) Get on with something else until the cycle machine is free?5.

A quick chat with your crewmate will clarify the situation immediately 5. C 6. FORDEC: Facts, Options, Risks, Decide, Execute, Check“People think it is going to be really tough later on down the road and don’t appreciate that the toughest part of the selection is that form,” says Peake. “Some of my friends, who are equally qualified test-pilots, did not pass the application form and I think it was a lack of care and attention at that early stage.”Ever since the first men – and it was only men – were chosen for the Apollo programme 50 years ago, the astronaut selection process has been regarded as the toughest job interview on the planet. It has also been shrouded in mystery. Now, with the European Space Agency eyeing another call for astronauts in 2020, Peake has written a guide to the process. For many, The Astronaut Selection Test Book: Do You Have What It Takes for Space? will be a prime example of Betteridge’s law. The journalistic adage states that any headline that ends in a question mark can confidently be answered: “No”.Some of the most crucial questions on the application form are disarmingly simple. One asks applicants to explain in 750 words why they want to be an astronaut. Quoted in the book, Gerhard Thiele, a former head of ESA’s astronaut ision in Cologne, tells Peake: “We’ve had people who write five pages.” Attention to detail matters, says Peake. In space you need to sweat the small stuff.Another asks if applicants are happy to move to Cologne, home to ESA’s astronaut training centre. The agency is looking for more than a yes. Asking how the agency will support them in their move, and help with any family, shows responsibility and the confidence to question authority, Peake says.Having to plough through puzzles fast ramps up the pressure on test days. One question has a student running 100m in 15 seconds, and asks what time they will record if they run 2kmhour faster. Is it 13, 13.6, 13.8 or 14.2 seconds? The maths is straightforward but there is no time to write out the full calculation: a mental shortcut helps.Beyond basic arithmetic tests are puzzles that assess how well, and how fast, people can rotate 3D shapes in their minds pull critical information from messy situations discern increasingly complex patterns and repeat strings of numbers backwards after hearing them through headphones.“You have to be a jack of all trades, and hopefully a master of some,” says Peake. “You don’t have to be a genius, but you do have to be high average in everything. They are looking for a spectrum of skills across the board.”There is a psychological element even to the mathematics tests. With too little time to answer all the questions, candidates have to make a call: should they finish but get some answers wrong, or fail to finish but give only correct answers? Here, the agency is looking for a balance.“They tend to pick people who go through the entire test skipping the harder questions and going back to them. It means they can prioritise their work.”Soft skills are just as important. No one wants an astronaut who can work out in seconds how swiftly a fire will consume the International Space Station’s air supply if they cannot agree with the crew what to do about it.These are skills that have become more important since the Apollo era. In time, the International Space Station will be handed over to private companies. The European Space Agency, along with the agencies of other nations, will focus on a station that orbits the moon ahead of a new era of lunar exploration. In the more distant future, Mars is, as ever, on the horizon. On deep space missions, you cannot radio Earth for help in an emergency: the signals can take 20 minutes to travel each way.“At the end of the day, somebody is potentially going to have to make some very difficult decisions on a journey to Mars without the benefit of liaising with ground and the rest of the crew is going to have to respect that decision,” says Peake. “Team skills are going to be absolutely essential.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e98d54f3d411d57d0cf377abec2a4e3cccb742/0_230_6894_4136/master/6894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28989466dcc5fb6a68b0d47795909c03","title":"tell us do you work in a food bank share your stories","story":"If you work in a food bank in the UK, we’d like to hear from you.

That they will in all likelihood not make it 10 on Saturday is arguably of less importance to the rugby world than the fact their last game of 2018 is against Ireland in front of a sellout Dublin crowd.The Irish capital is still buzzing after the men in green beat the All Blacks, leading the New Zealand coach, Steve Hanson, to anoint Ireland as the best in the world. But the Americans will not face the first-choice Irish XV. After wins against Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Canada (twice), Russia, Scotland, Samoa and Romania, Gary Gold’s Eagles have a fine stage on which to showcase their striking improvement.“We know this weekend will present our greatest challenge yet,” the head coach said, in a release from USA Rugby.“Ireland will be relentless as ever and our guys have spent the last week ensuring that they approach Saturday’s game with the level of intensity that will put us in the best position to meet the fight.”Officially, Ireland are the No2 team in the game – World Rugby’s rankings are based on cumulative results, which has kept New Zealand at No1 for nine years. The USA have climbed to 13th, an all-time high and ahead of Italy and Georgia, a team many think should replace the Italians in the Six Nations. Lest any American get too giddy, Tonga, No12 and World Cup opponents for the Eagles in Japan next year, were thumped 74-24 by No 3 Wales last week, the kind of lopsided result that occurs all too often if lower-ranked teams are not right at the top of their game.All of which means that while the Ireland coach, Joe Schmidt, is able to rest his key men – the centre Garry Ringrose is the only starter from the team that beat New Zealand – and devote a part of his mind to his hotly debated future, Gold has selected his strongest possible team. That was something he couldn’t do for the non-cap defeat by the Mãori All Blacks in Chicago that started the fall schedule.The pack, the basis of this year’s success, is led by the promising Saracens loosehead Titi Lamositele, the genially enormous Worcester hooker Joe Taufete’e and the tighthead Paul Mullen, who until recently was learning a lot with Newcastle. Doncaster’s Nick Civetta and Greg Peterson of Glasgow form a second row solid enough to keep Samu Manoa of Cardiff on the bench.There is a key absence in the back row, where the New Zealand-based flanker Tony Lamborn is injured. His place is filled by Hanco Germishuys, a young talent who shone in the first season of Major League Rugby.That competition will kick off again in January, with new teams in New York and Toronto. No 8 Cam Dolan, a try-scoring presence for the Eagles and a new signing for the Nola Gold, will be the only MLR player – Germishuys is currently without a club – in the Dublin XV and not from the Glendale Raptors, the Denver-area team that lost the first championship game to the Seattle Seawolves.Glendale provide the blindside flanker John Quill – born and raised in Cork, once a Munster academy player – and the halfbacks Sean Davies and Will Magie, inexperienced internationals in a key area where the the injured AJ MacGinty, of Sale, is badly missed. The outside backs are at strength, Harlequins’ former Chicago Bear Paul Lasike in the centres and captain Blaine Scully, of Cardiff, on the wing.The USA have never beaten Ireland: their 30-29 win over a young Scotland team in Houston in June was their first victory over a major nation. But some games have been closer than others.In Houston in 2013, during a Lions tour, there were no tries and Ireland won 15-12. In Harrison, New Jersey, in 2017, another Ireland team missing its Lions won 55-19, nine tries to three. Given that Dublin in late November tends to be a little less debilitatingly humid than Texas in mid-June, the score on Saturday may prove closer to the latter than the former.Ireland: W Addison (Ulster) A Conway (Munster), G Ringrose (Leinster), S McCloskey (Ulster), D Sweetnam J Carbery (both Munster), J Cooney (Ulster) D Kilcoyne, N Scannell (both Munster), F Bealham (Connacht), T Beirne (Munster), I Henderson (Ulster), R Ruddock (Leinster, capt), J Murphy (Ulster), J Conan (Leinster).

Stokes bowls shortish and the ball cracks Karunaratne in the sternum. He goes down, and the physio comes out to check him over, but eventually he gets up, dusts himself down, sets himself and pulls the next ball away for a handsome single. That’s the only run from a good, hostile over and that’s TEA.50th over: Sri Lanka 182-2 (Karunaratne 80, Mendis 6) Karunaratne clips the ball just wide of Jennings, who is still prowling short leg and seemed to expect the ball to go to his left even as it went to his right. Time for one more over before tea.49th over: Sri Lanka 179-2 (Karunaratne 78, Mendis 5) Stokes bowls, and Mendis works the ball to third man for four. Leach, having dismissed Mendis in every over of this series so far, is surely on his way back48th over: Sri Lanka 174-2 (Karunaratne 78, Mendis 1) Karunaratne reverse-sweeps, and the camera follows the ball as it runs towards the boundary, nobody anywhere near it. Over the green grass it skips, lonely as a cloud. And then, at the last moment, Leach arrives onscreen from nowhere and es in its path. I actually jumped slightly when he suddenly appeared, so unexpected was it. It was like something out of a (very sedate, more terranean) remake of Alien. A few moments later it’s De Silva whose heart is in his mouth, as he gently turns the ball to Jennings, who reacts quickly and snaffles the catch.A breakthrough! And another fine catch from Jennings at short leg!47th over: Sri Lanka 168-1 (De Silva 73, Karunaratne 75) A big lbw shout as Stokes raps De Silva on the pad, but the ball was always heading down the leg side (he says, as Hawk-Eye shows it clipping the outside edge of leg stump). England were desperate enough to consider reviewing it on the off chance, but decided against it.45th over: Sri Lanka 164-1 (De Silva 70, Karunaratne 72) A couple of singles, and a promising start from Stokes. Decent pace and bounce, and was there the vaguest scent of swing there? Now, on that knitwear thread, who even owns a coffee pot warmer? Is that a thing? Couldn’t even a child knit something a little more useful?44th over: Sri Lanka 162-1 (De Silva 69, Karunaratne 71) De Silva tries to flay the ball through the covers but it bounces low and his wild heave misses it entirely. That was, er, a little rash. And now England’s other ignored bowler, Ben Stokes, is going to have a go.43rd over: Sri Lanka 161-1 (De Silva 68, Karunaratne 71) Karunaratne clips the ball off his ankles and through midwicket, a lovely, finessed shot, then he drives through the covers for another, and finally he caresses it behind point and gets within a couple of feet of a third boundary before Bairstow slides in to stop it.42nd over: Sri Lanka 150-1 (De Silva 67, Karunaratne 61) Rashid’s only previous over in this innings went for six runs and clearly failed to convince Root that he was likely to be very helpful. This one costs a comparatively miserly two, and there’s some sharp turn there for him.41st over: Sri Lanka 148-1 (de Silva 66, Karunaratne 60) Moeen bowls, and the batsmen take a single each. “I get the role Root envisages for Rash - short one-day spells to mix things up,” writes Martin Hamilton. “But only one over from him so far suggests that Root still doesn’t fully trust him.” Looks like he’s about to have another go...40th over: Sri Lanka 146-1 (de Silva 64, Karunaratne 59) Five dots from Leach to De Silva, and then a single.39th over: Sri Lanka 145-1 (de Silva 64, Karunaratne 59) De Silva mows Moeen to square leg for four. Apologies, by the way, for the absence of the advertised Rob Smyth - he and I swapped responsibilities today to allow me to watch my chosen football team being resoundingly thrashed by a better football team, which should be fun.38th over: Sri Lanka 140-1 (de Silva 59, Karunaratne 59) Hello team. The sun is shining in Colombo and Sri Lanka are making hay. Karunaratne has faced three deliveries more than De Silva, but pleasingly the batsmen have, for the first time since the 22nd-over 28-28 draw, scored an identical number of runs.37th over: Sri Lanka 137-1 ( de Silva 57, Karunaratne 58) A strangled shout for lbw by Moeen, but it is outside the line. He is swept next ball for a single. Sri Lanka playing the patience game here. And that’s DRINKS! I’ll hand you over now -not to Rob Smyth as I advertised earlier- but to the bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Simon Burnton. Thanks Simon.I’ll leave that with you OBOers.... thank you for your time and emailstweets . Apologies if you didn’t manage to get through. Good morning!36th over: Sri Lanka 136-1 ( de Silva 56, Karunaratne 58) Huge turn for Leach this over, Sri Lanka safely see it off35th over: Sri Lanka 135-1 ( de Silva 55, Karunaratne 58)A drive by de Silva off Moeen scatters the egrets at deep-cover. and brings him his fifty: 77 balls, 6 x 4 and a drop. Sri Lanka scoring at well over four an over this session. He follows up with a sweep for four and that’s the first hundred partnership of the series for Sri Lanka.34th over: Sri Lanka 128-1 ( de Silva 49, Karunaratne 57) Karunaratne waits, waits, until the final ball of the over when he does a rapid quick-step, turns square, and lifts Leach over mid-wicket for four. Apologies if you’re writing in, my email is on strike again.  33rd over: Sri Lanka 121-1 ( de Silva 47, Karunaratne 52) If Root brought himself on to stem the runs, it hasn’t entirely worked. Four leg byes - time to mix it up a bit with Mo or Rashid. Or Ben Stokes?32nd over: Sri Lanka 115-1 ( de Silva 46, Karunaratne 51) Leach again. A straight one catches de Silva unawares and he gets in a terrible tangle with his pads. 31st over: Sri Lanka 115-1 ( de Silva 46, Karunaratne 51) Joe Root tries to make amends by bringing himself on, Sri Lanka largely untroubled. 30th over: Sri Lanka 113-1 ( de Silva 45, Karunaratne 50)  And with a wriggle round the corner, that’s fifty for Karunaratne - he’s played watchfully, intelligently, leaving the rash shots to de Silva, though of course he was dropped on two. It’s his seventh fifty of the year. A filthy Leach toils on. 29th over: Sri Lanka 111-1 ( de Silva 44, Karunaratne 49)  In Broad runs off his new short run - courtesy of Richard Hadlee. Brave work, exhausting work, but two fours suggest this might be his last over of this spell. The best shot when Karunartne sends the ball humming straight back to the boundary for four. Rob - on in half an hour - this is for you. 28th over: Sri Lanka 101-1 ( de Silva 44, Karunaratne 39)  A terrible looking slop-sweep by de Silva off Leach goes high into the air, Joe Denly who has just come onto the field for ?, tears towards it at midwicket and it falls just in front of his boot. I think he must have lost sight of that. Anyway, further frustration for England. 27th over: Sri Lanka 98-1 ( de Silva 43, Karunaratne 37) Oh dear, Joe Root. It came quickly, but he should have held onto that. Nowhere to hide. Foakes puts a hand out in comfort, but it’s an awkward position for him. A quick single to the last ball puts the tin lid on it for Broad.  Root again! at first slip. The ball goes into his hands, onto his chin, and onto the floor. Broad holds the invective. de Silva lives to fight another ball.26th over: Sri Lanka 94-1 ( de Silva 42, Karunaratne 34)  Up on his toes, de Silva drives Moeen, away it goes on the off side. Four. A most sweetly timed shot. Imagine that first note of Once in Royal David’s City. That’s how sweetJohn Starbuck is back: “Tanya,It depends on your style of coffee-pot. A cafetière requires what is basically a knitted tube for a warmer, so wearing it outdoors in unlikely unless you’re The Cat In The Hat or a joke leprechaun. A more globular coffee-pot would be better for a double-duty warmer, but anyhow the best option would be to have an actual hat, knitted to size, then use rubber bands to keep it on the coffee-pot. Or get a coffee-making machine.”My memory of a coffee-making machine is my granny’s death trap that spurted boiling water at random. I’ve steered clear since.25th over: Sri Lanka 88-1 ( de Silva 37, Karunaratne 33) Broad back on the money again, plugging away, ball after ball. Thankless work really. Sri Lanka working the angles well, a single here, a couple there. 24th over: Sri Lanka 84-1 ( de Silva 34, Karunaratne 32) de Silva overtakes Karunaratne after pulling a short ball from Moeen to the boundary.23rd over: Sri Lanka 79-1 ( de Silva 29, Karunaratne 32) Broad has had a rub-down, dined and a rest, and is back with the first over after lunch. Probing. Then, eeek, Karunaratne is tempted to drive and gets an outside edge between slip and gully which whizzes down to the boundary.Zaph Mann is back with knitting news:“I have a Tea Cosy knitted by my Mum’s best school friend - they stayed friends to the end.That you have a “coffee pot warmer” is mildly reassuring, but I’m still non-plussed that OBO writers aren’t continuing the essentials of breakfast - Tea - stiff (“builders” if necessary) and two soft boiled eggs judged by watching carefully - with good toast, or if in a rush, same toast with Bitter marmalade (seville oranges are important)I try to ignore the ‘laddish’ 30-50 year olds OBO writers talking about monster energy drinks and the like.”Zaph, I think today’s emails suggest OBOers should stay well away from eggs, although I like your style (though not the marmalade - the devil’s work) Also - laddish OBO writers? An oxymoron surely.The players walk out with Sri Lanka 262 behind and nine wickets in hand. The email should work now so please get in touch if you’d like to.Nick writes from lovely TorquayI hope your daughter knitted the coffee pot warmer the same size as your head so that you can use it both indoors and outdoors.Hmmm, a bit confused. I’m not sure if I should be insulted or not, my head not yet fully functioning.Not sure how keen you are with the clicking needles.... but if anyone is short of a Christmas present idea, about six years ago my daughter knitted me a coffee pot warmer (with the help of grandma). I can confirm that it is still working beautifully now on a freezing November morning.Sri Lanka had the best of the morning- quick wickets followed by handsome- if not risk free - batting. A shout out for Stuart Broad, who strained every sinew of excellence and was rewarded by a drop from Joe Root at first slip. And a left-hander for lunch for Jack Leach for the first time this series. Time for some coffee - see you in half an hour!22nd over: Sri Lanka 74-1 ( de Silva 28, Karunaratne 28) Enter Rashid for the last over before lunch. de Silva misses the googly, might have got a glove to it, but Foakes has no chance of grabbing it as the ball is hidden by de Silva’s body until the last. de Silva pokes a couple more down to third man and yes, they’re walking off. Not sure what they’ll be having, but OBO-ers are surely sitting down to eggs. One last email on the matter from Finbar Anslow:“Commiserations to Damian, a slightly happier morning was an unemployed period in Kemptown, forlornly waiting for my last egg to boil when came that most joyful thunky pre millennial sound from the letter box, a (what’s green and gets you drunk?) Giro! Happily setting off I trotted down to the post office, did some much needed food shopping and had a swift early half in the Barleymow, returning home the smell in the kitchen was appalling - bits of exploded egg everywhere including the ceiling, but did I care? By the way Tanya, how much of England’s success in Sri Lanka do you think is down to their improvement and how much is due to the home team having gone slightly off the boil?”21st over: Sri Lanka 68-1 ( de Silva 24, Karunaratne 26) Moeen getting the ball to spit past the edge here. Great bowling. The over is spoilt by a widish half volley which is driven - what elegance!- for four by de Silva.20th over: Sri Lanka 59-1 ( de Silva 17, Karunaratne 23) Karunaratne drives just over Leach’s outstretched hand. Three from the over. 19th over: Sri Lanka 57-1 ( de Silva 16, Karunaratne 23)  A hotch-potch of an over. Moeen confuses de Silva with the flight, who is saved by his pads. He follows up with an ugly swipe to midwicket before Karunartne reverse-sweeps for four.18th over: Sri Lanka 51-1 ( de Silva 15, Karunaratne 18) Leach strays by millimetres and de Silva raises his left elbow, twinkles his feet and goes through the covers for four. Next ball is wider, worse, and de Silva square cuts, another four. Bootiful.17th over: Sri Lanka 43-1 ( de Silva 7, Karunaratne 18) Moeen tightens the leash with another maiden. Can Sri Lanka absorb the pressure? Karunaratne chips the last ball just short of Root at mid-on. Fifteen minutes till lunch.16th over: Sri Lanka 43-1 ( de Silva 7, Karunaratne 18) de Silva drives loosely and high at Leach, just a finger’s length past a leaping Bairstow at mid-off, and on to the boundary. Next ball, Leach senses de Silva coming again and sends it in faster, and de Silva pads it away. A fascinating little battle.15th over: Sri Lanka 39-1 ( de Silva 3, Karunaratne 18) Moeen appeals for an lbw, Root thinks about it, but decides against. Wisely.

The movement has no leader and its ad-hoc barricades at tollbooths, roundabouts and fuel depots have been organised on social media.The movement, which began as a protest against rising fuel taxes, has grown into a wider outpouring over inequality, a political class seen as cut off from reality and the pro-business Macron’s persistently negative image as a “president of the rich”.Marie, 31, a childminder in the Var region of southern France, has been protesting all week at a tollbooth “People are exasperated, there is so much anger – taxes are going up, our salaries aren’t. When you work hard, it feels unfair,” she said.“My retired parents can’t make ends meet so they had to get work distributing advertising leaflets. The government isn’t listening. To me, Macron is the president of the rich, slashing taxes for the wealthy, ignoring the rest of us. Politicians are cut off from our lives.“Those in charge are one big oligarchy. The media can’t be trusted either. I’d consider voting Marine Le Pen, but the whole political class is a letdown and I wonder why I vote at all. I worry the future will be even worse for my three children than it is for me.”Two people have been accidentally killed and more than 530 injured, 17 seriously, in a week of protests and roadblocks over what one 30-year-old factory worker who has been attending roadblocks in the south of France called “a broken society where we’re counting pennies to reach the end of the month, sick of politicians who don’t give a damn robbing the poor to give to the rich”.Macron, who has built his political identity on a refusal to back down in the face of public pressure or street protests, this week called for better “dialogue” to explain his policies.The centrist president has insisted his “transformation” of France through loosening labour laws and overhauling the workings of the welfare state would benefit ordinary French people, who have been through decades of mass unemployment.But he also promised the authorities would be “uncompromising” if protests degenerated into disorder. The government this week instructed police to break up the remaining roadblocks, particularly those around fuel depots and sites of strategic importance.Speaking about events on the island, as curfews were imposed in some areas to break up protests, Macron said: “We will be uncompromising because we can’t accept the things we’ve seen.”Dominique, 50, an unemployed technician at a roadblock in the town of Martigues, near Marseille, said: “It’s about much more than fuel. The government has left us with nothing.”“There are legitimate grievances that have to be given a hearing,” he told his cabinet on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709540.1543047436!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin city council seeks 400 000 to set up taskforce to crack down on airbnbs","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Housing Eoghan Murphy last month announced plans to tighten the rules around the use of properties for short-term lets in areas of high housing demand. File photograph: Getty ImagesA dedicated team to police potentially illegal Airbnb-style rentals in Dublin is to be formed by Dublin City Council in response to the upcoming regulation of the short-term lets.The council is seeking €400,000 from the Department of Housing and Planning to set up a new enforcement regime to deal with what it says will be the “logistically very difficult” area of holiday-let regulation.Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy last month announced plans to tighten the rules around the use of properties for short-term lets, such as Airbnb, in areas of high housing demand.Mr Murphy is proposing that owners of buy-to-let properties will have to get planning permission to run short-term lets for more than three months every year. Owner-occupiers are not expected to face restrictions in letting inidual rooms in their houses for short-term stays but will only be able to let their entire homes for three months in a year. The head of the city council’s planning department Richard Shakespeare said the “form or content” of the regulations was “not known exactly” and it was “not fully clear” how house-shares were to be dealt with, but with a potential 5,000 short-term lets in the city, enforcement was expected to be onerous.“The enforcement of short-term lettings is logistically very difficult, with problems establishing ownership, gaining access to apartmentshouses and most importantly a requirement to prove illegal occupation.”Mr Shakespeare said he envisaged difficulties with “hearsay evidence regarding proof of use” as short-term guests using a property at the time of inspections “will be gone and will not be in a position to give evidence on our behalf” he said.“This fact alone will require planning enforcement officers to go out in pairs in many cases to make their evidence admissible in court if the need arises.” The production of internet listings of properties from short-term letting platforms would not be sufficient evidence to allow the council to issue an enforcement notice against the property owner or sustain a conviction in court, he said. “The onus will be on the local authority to provide first-hand evidence of occupation of properties for short-termholiday letting purposes. The owner of the property will then have to be traced and served with appropriate noticeslegal proceedings as appropriate,” he said. “As we could be dealing with in excess of 5,000 properties it will in all likelihood be resource intensive.”Mr Shakespeare said he intended to seek in the region of €400,000 from the department as an “initial cost” to establish a new regime to enforce the regulations. A spokesman for the Department of Housing said it would be engaging with the council with regard to their “needs for enforcement” and noted that the funding requirement set out by Mr Shakespeare was “an initial estimate only”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"No trains will depart from Heuston until further notice except Heuston to HazelhatchLegal observers believe we can now weigh up the right of defendants to a fair trialNew rules seeking to ensure only bona-fide journalists and lawyers may report or tweet from court cases will come into effect on MondayRegulating short-term lets expected to be \u0026lsquologistically very difficult\u0026rsquo says head of planningSeveral in the organisation who had sex abuse complaints made against them are in prison\u0026lsquoFarmers ready to roll up their sleeves on climate action\u0026rsquoThirty-five years ago, Republican gunmen massacred worshippers at a church in Darkley, Co ArmaghIMO says release of earnings figures are \u0026lsquomisleading and unhelpful\u0026rsquoPhilip Hammond and Liam Fox visit fails to soften DUP stance on withdrawal agreementVictim blaming and flawed legislation is contributed to \u0026lsquounderreporting\u0026rsquo of sex assaultsLiam O\u0026rsquoConnell who played role in rescue of 30 students was found with drugs worth \u0026euro270,000Friends and colleagues gather in Trinity College to celebrate the life of John CurranIrish embassy and Department of Justice encourage family to re-apply after visa appeal refusedRegulations will bring gambling service providers within scope of anti-money laundering lawSacristan had eye gouged when he tried to stop David O\u0026rsquoDonovan (41) stealing church collection boxHEA chief resigned this year amid frustration over Department \u0026lsquomicro-managing\u0026rsquoFather had attempted suicide after hearing of Garda investigation into his abuseTransition from fossil fuels may have \u0026lsquodevastating\u0026rsquo implications for some workersLabour\u0026rsquos Conor McGinn will not support draft agreement as \u0026lsquoit is bad for St Helens\u0026rsquoNational Homeless and Housing Coalition call on \u0026lsquoas many people as possible\u0026rsquo to join"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3708621.1543007237!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu leaders set to adopt brexit withdrawal treaty","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May will be in Brussels on Saturday to meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council  president Donald Tusk. Photograph: Will OliverBloombergAmid intense political and diplomatic activity ahead of Sunday’s crucial European summit, British prime minister Theresa May travels to Brussels on Saturday to finalise the agreements on which she has staked her political future and the relationship between the European Union and the UK.Senior political and official sources in Dublin and Brussels said on Friday night that they expected the summit to adopt both the withdrawal treaty – the legally binding document that will govern the UK’s exit if ratified by the European and British parliaments – and the declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.On Friday, at a meeting in Brussels of the “sherpas” – the personal representatives of the national leaders – the texts of both agreements were regarded as settled, according to authoritative sources.A Spanish threat to derail the summit appeared to have been averted by agreement among officials to language which reaffirms Madrid’s veto over future UK-EU talks impinging on Gibraltar.The sherpas agreed to a clarification statement by the 27 remaining EU states, which will not be part of the withdrawal agreement or the political declaration, though initial responses in Madrid were sceptical. But no more than Mrs May, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez will not be allowed by his fellow EU leaders to reopen the agreed treaty text, Brussels sources said.Mrs May will be in Brussels on Saturday to meet the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the president of the Council – the group of EU leaders that meets on Sunday – Donald Tusk.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said at a meeting in Sligo that his expectation was that the EU would be able to sign off on the withdrawal agreement on Sunday. He said there was an issue in relation to Spain “but I am confident that can be worked out”.Mr Varadkar also spoke to Mr Juncker on Friday to inform him that the Dáil had approved the withdrawal agreement and that the Government was happy with the text of the future relationship declaration.Mr Varadkar told reporters in Sligo that if the withdrawal treaty was approved, it would ensure that “there won’t be any changes at all for these two years, if not longer, giving businesses time to prepare and also gives us time to negotiate a future relationship”.The Taoiseach said that lots of people “may be criticising this but I don’t see anyone putting anything better on the table”.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney also spoke to new British Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay by phone on Friday.In Northern Ireland, the DUP’s party conference will be addressed on Saturday by arch-Brexiteer Boris Johnson, who will urge the party to maintain its opposition to the withdrawal treaty when it comes before the House of Commons for a vote in the coming weeks. On Friday night the British chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond addressed a party dinner appealing for support for the deal. But on Saturday DUP leaders will again stress their opposition, warning Mrs May that DUP support for her government was in question if she continued with the present deal.Several sources said that with the treaty and declaration texts agreed, EU leaders would seek to assist Mrs May when they meet in Brussels on Sunday morning. “They’ll avoid any triumphalism, avoid a long meeting – just get the business done,” said one source.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: BBC NewsPA WireTheresa May has refused to rule out resigning as prime minister if MPs reject her Brexit deal, raising the stakes ahead of a summit in Brussels on Sunday where European Union leaders are expected to approve it. Asked three times during a BBC phone-in on Friday, the prime minister repeatedly declined to say she would carry on in Number 10 if the deal is voted down in parliament.“I am focused on ensuring we get this deal. I believe it’s the right deal for the UK. As I’m sitting here I am not thinking about me but getting a deal for this country. That’s what drives me,” she said.“I am going to be around the country, explaining the deal up and down the country. I think this is important. It’s not just about MPs it’s about people understanding what the country is about.”\u0026nbspMore than 80 Conservative backbenchers have indicated that they could vote against the deal, as have the DUP’s 10 MPs who want the prime minister to scrap the Northern Ireland backstop. Dominic Raab, who resigned as Brexit secretary last week, said Mrs May’s proposals were worse than remaining in the EU.“I’m not going to advocate staying in the EU. But, if you just presented me terms, this deal or EU membership, because we would effectively be bound by the same rules but without the control or voice over them, yes, I think this would be even worse than that,” he told the BBC.The prime minister said he believed her deal was a good one for Britain and that it ensured that the country’s future would be in its own hands. She said that if MPs rejected the deal in a “meaningful vote” next month, there would be little point in returning to Brussels seeking to renegotiate it. “I don’t think they will come to us and say we’ll get a better deal. I’m making sure we get this through parliament. If we don’t, what we will see is more ision and uncertainty. My focus, all my focus, is getting . . . we’ve got to finalise the deal on Sunday but beyond that it’s getting the vote through,” she said.Mrs May said she would travel around Britain in the coming weeks to take her case for the Brexit deal directly to the people beyond Westminster. Downing Street is working to persuade MPs at Westminster too and some reacted cynically to the news that John Hayes, a Brexiteer who is backing the deal, is to be knighted.Downing Street dismissed speculation that, if the deal is voted down next month, MPs could be asked to vote again as the United States Congress did 10 years ago on the Tarp bank rescue deal, which passed on the second vote. Mrs May declined to say what her Plan B is if the deal is rejected, describing her job as persuading people it is a good deal.\u0026nbsp“The job of an MP is to say to themselves: ‘Does this deliver on what people voted for?’ And I believe it does deliver . . . this should be at the forefront of people’s minds,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

2017 | Terror attacks in the UK“We are also ensuring technology companies play their part by stopping terrorists from exploiting their platforms,” he said.In its report yesterday on the terrorist attacks, the ISC revealed an MI5 assessment showed “almost all attack planners downloaded, shared or consumed radical and extremist media of some kind.”Salman Abedi, the Manchester Arena bomber who killed 22 people including children, had also been able to manufacture his improvised explosive devices from online videos.“Action that affects their profits hits home harder than any sense of ‘doing the right thing’, and it is this that the Government should focus its efforts on.The committee highlighted cases where tech firms had refused to remove extremist content or co-operate despite Government requests, often citing the right of their customers to privacy as “trumping other considerations.”In one, an unnamed tech firm claimed the “violent and disturbing images” linked back to an academic site and to remove it “would compromise the quality of analysis the site owner provides.” Another refused to take down the website of a banned terrorist group.WhatsApp cited its “end to end encryption” for not revealing to police the final messages of  Westminster attacker Khalid Masood who stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death.The committee said it had been among the first to castigate the social media firms for failing to be more proactive in hunting down and removing extremist material rather than relying on users, organisations or police to alert them to it.But that was, four years ago after the terrorist murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.Although the firms have hired more moderators to assess material, the committee was frustrated that they continued in many cases to be used as a “safe haven” for extremists and terrorists.Searching the internet for “how to make a bomb” returned almost 2m results and a search for “beheading video” returned 250,000 hits in a study five years ago - and it was likely to have increased since.Although the tech firms were developing algorithms to track down terrorist material and alert police to it, the MPs said: “It is disappointing that - despite a great deal of engagement - little tangible progress has been made in the four years...and the scale of the challenge remains significant.”The criticism was backed last night by Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee, who this week wrote to Twitter, demanding to know why extremist material from a proscribed far right group was still available on its site.“It is frankly outrageous that these internet giants continue to profit off dangerous content, which we know can have fatal consequences,” she told The Daily .“These companies have been asked repeatedly to develop better systems to remove illegal material and have failed to do so. It is not good enough.”“Given the vast scale of this content, law enforcement and intelligence agencies are simply not equipped to tackle this issue alone. Social media companies must immediately take responsibility for dealing with extremist and illegal materials on their sites.”Senior counter terror officers said they had struggled to get quality data out of the tech giants for years. “They simply don’t get it, so to take action that affects their advertising revenues would be the best thing to do,” said one ex-counter terror chief.Comment: It\u0026#39s not the words that cause hatred, but the person interpreting themForm-filling distracts police from fighting violent crime, says police federation chiefAmerican killed by remote tribe believed god was helping him reach islandComment: Like David the chimp, Mrs May has hauled herself up from a near-certain deathComment: Clamping down on fake news is one thing.

He was first pictured on social media by a fellow pupil with the message: “How’s there a 30-year-old man in our maths class?”Other pictures apparently from the man’s Facebook account showed him with a moustache, facial stubble and drinking from a bottle of beer.Some parents were so concerned that they removed their children from school. The scandal prompted the school to remove the man, believed to be 6ft 1ins tall.Stoke High School in Ipswich, SuffolkAlthough the Home Office refused to reveal what age he is now believed to be, it is understood from sources that he is being treated officially as an adult asylum seeker.A department spokesman said: “We are fully committed to safeguarding children and are looking into the circumstances of this case to understand how it was handled.“Age-disputed cases remain a challenging area of work in which no single assessment technique, or combination of techniques, is likely to determine an inidual\u0027s age with precision.In the absence of clear and credible documentary evidence, Home Office staff must rely on physical appearance and demeanour to make an initial assessment on whether a person claiming to be a child is under 18.If an inidual is assessed to be under 18, but subsequent concerns about their age are raised - for example by a school - we will act quickly to reconsider the case.A spokesman for the school, run by the Ormiston Academies Trust, confirmed the Year 11 pupil is no longer there, adding: “This is a matter for the Home Office. We cannot comment further on inidual cases.”A Facebook profile apparently by the man described him as having been an architecture student at the Islamic Azad University in Abadan, Iran, before living in Erfurt, Germany.

If the application is unsuccessful, and appeal rights are exhausted, removal action will be pursued as appropriate.In the absence of documentary evidence, Home Office staff are only able to treat a claimant as an adult if their physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggest that they are significantly over 18 years of age - and where two officers have reached this conclusion independently.The threshold is set deliberately high so that only those who are very clearly over 18 are assessed as adults.Please review our commenting policyComment: It\u0026#39s not the words that cause hatred, but the person interpreting themForm-filling distracts police from fighting violent crime, says police federation chiefAmerican killed by remote tribe believed god was helping him reach islandComment: Like David the chimp, Mrs May has hauled herself up from a near-certain deathComment: Clamping down on fake news is one thing.

They won’t accept my BitPay, what’s the point of Black Friday sales fiat losers?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Retailers will be hoping the day of discounts can boost sales amid a gloomy market. Debenhams chief executive Sergio Bucher said Black Friday was the “starting gun of the Christmas campaign, and said despite heavy discounting, companies can still make a profit. A brief history of Black FridayBest Black Friday UK deals of 2018Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisWhy we\u0027ve been scrutinising the high street on the business desk He told the BBC that Debenhams will sell around four times as much on Black Friday as on a normal Friday, and added: “Yes, customers are going to be coming to stores, and they\u0027ll buy some discounted product, but they\u0027ll also buy some full price product, they\u0027ll be having a coffee, eating a piece of cake, drink gin and tonic - I think it\u0027s a great shopping trip. “It is one of our biggest days of the year.”Bargain hunters opted to use smartphones and tablets to make their purchases over desktop computers, at 62 per cent versus 38 per cent. For the first year ever, Loqate said, smartphone transactions accounted for more than half of the online shopping activity, reversing last year’s trend which saw desktop dominating. The group said this indicated a younger demographic was participating in Black Friday shopping.Matthew Furneaux, global commercial director at Loqate said: “This is the year that mobile really takes over online retail. As Black Friday kicks off with a very early start, success for retailers is becoming increasingly tied with their mobile offer. Consumers are voting with fingers and thumbs.“Making it easy for customers to buy on mobile will be the key determinant not just for a good Black Friday, but for a good Christmas and even medium-term survival.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On a weekday, when thousands of commuters were trying to get to work, college and school let alone the other, vast number of folk who thought they they would see the railway as their most convenient form of travel.Because it was in the North, the stoppage raised barely a glimmer of interest in the South. If it had happened in Kent or Surrey, to trains into London Bridge or Waterloo, all hell would have broken loose. Instead, it was just another day of misery, to go with the other numerous days lost, including when they changed the timetable, and the services across the North could not cope.Meanwhile, the Government is pressing ahead with a £56bn plan to develop HS2. Will the new high-speed link between London and the North-West change any of this? Will it improve things? Not at all. Will it make a difference that justifies such vast expenditure? Hardly. Is it a grotesque example of ministerial machismo, of gesture politics, of a total inability to see the wood for the trees? You bet it is.Archaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeNow we know HS2 really is a flawed projectHS2 requires extra £43bn \u0027for people to make the most of it\u0027The trains I’m talking about, the ones that were cancelled, were mostly on the branch lines, on the routes that people use day in, day out - not the West Coast Line, which already has a fast, comfortable service. In my lifetime, since growing up in Cumbria, and travelling to and from London to visit family, journey times have plummeted. On the main, trunk route - not on the secondary ones. This is where the problem lies, where the service is creaking.Cutting several minutes off the London to Manchester service does not matter a h’apporth. What would boost the experience immeasurably there would be to ensure that wifi works all the way, that a mobile signal is not lost. But that, too, is not what HS2 is about.Already, there is talk by those on the inside that the projected costs are soaring. The “main works civil contracts” on the London to Birmingham section, reports The Sunday Times, are “several billion pounds” over the official budget of £6.6bn. That’s before any earth is turned, and all manner of unseen, below ground problems are discovered.Conscious of a final bill that could spiral out of control, and being seen to get a grip, ministers are demanding that instead of sanctioning extra expenditure, costs are being renegotiated, to stick to the budgeted figure. This, in turn, has led to delays, as more design and development is required, and specifications redrawn. Again, the word is that the vast project - the country’s biggest and most demanding infrastructure scheme - is likely to be more than a year behind schedule.That\u0027s how fast HS2\u0026nbspservices will travel at when the project is completedPart of the issue here is that mooted figures are proving inaccurate, the result, apparently of an insistence that the new railway meets a deadline for the beginning of services, of 2026.The thinking behind this demand, that Britain is sick and tired of major capital constructions that seem to take forever to reach fulfilment (runway expansion of Heathrow was first raised exactly 50 years ago) is laudable. But put that together with a scheme that is huge and complex, and it can become a recipe for chaos. And that’s without HS2 being unnecessary in the first place.This is what ministers should realise: that £56bn buys you an awful lot of terribly needed enhancements, for instance to existing country and suburban services, and to digitalisation.There is a subtext, of course, to HS2 - one that is hardly ever raised, let alone publicly admitted. And it is that the 250mph railway has another purpose, beyond rushing passengers from London to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. It is that the faster railway makes commuting from Birmingham in particular all that more manageable. House prices in the West Midlands are so much cheaper than in the South-East. Public sector workers in essential occupations, in sectors like the NHS and education, will be able to afford to commute from Brum. HS2, you see, is aimed in part at alleviating London’s growing housing crisis. Which makes it a very expensive solution indeed.When confronted with the news of the overruns and delay, the Department for Transport said it would not comment on speculation. “Our priority is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.”Yes, but does the overall project seriously provide value for money?Ministers have the ability to stop it in its tracks, to ert the investment elsewhere. Of course, that would involve a loss of pride. There would be some dismay in the North, but not as much as might be expected - particularly if the money was spent on other local, much-needed advancements. Perhaps they should test attitudes towards the new service before it\u0027s too late.For there are warning lights flashing all over this. An awful lot of cash is being committed to something for which there is little demand. Getting from A to B may become quicker, but B to C will be just as slow –\u0026nbspand it’s the B to C that is used by so many people every day, that ceased to operate last week and will do so again, even with HS2.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Retailers will be hoping the day of discounts can boost sales amid a gloomy market. Debenhams chief executive Sergio Bucher said Black Friday was the “starting gun of the Christmas campaign, and said despite heavy discounting, companies can still make a profit. A brief history of Black FridayBest Black Friday UK deals of 2018Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisWhy we\u0027ve been scrutinising the high street on the business desk He told the BBC that Debenhams will sell around four times as much on Black Friday as on a normal Friday, and added: “Yes, customers are going to be coming to stores, and they\u0027ll buy some discounted product, but they\u0027ll also buy some full price product, they\u0027ll be having a coffee, eating a piece of cake, drink gin and tonic - I think it\u0027s a great shopping trip. “It is one of our biggest days of the year.”Bargain hunters opted to use smartphones and tablets to make their purchases over desktop computers, at 62 per cent versus 38 per cent. For the first year ever, Loqate said, smartphone transactions accounted for more than half of the online shopping activity, reversing last year’s trend which saw desktop dominating. The group said this indicated a younger demographic was participating in Black Friday shopping.Matthew Furneaux, global commercial director at Loqate said: “This is the year that mobile really takes over online retail. As Black Friday kicks off with a very early start, success for retailers is becoming increasingly tied with their mobile offer. Consumers are voting with fingers and thumbs.“Making it easy for customers to buy on mobile will be the key determinant not just for a good Black Friday, but for a good Christmas and even medium-term survival.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Instead of providing assistance to the companies they bullied them, squeezed them for large fees and stripped them of assets.\u0026nbspMr Mills arranged sex parties with prostitutes, holidays to Thailand and Barbados and other gifts for Mr Scourfield.A spokesperson for LLoyds said: \u0027We have received Mr Edmonds’ legal letter and we will review the contents before responding.\u0026nbsp“We fully understand the anguish he feels at the failure of his businesses, but on the information we have seen so far we simply cannot agree that this is the result of actions taken by the former HBOS business.\u0026nbsp“We have engaged with Mr Edmonds and we made determined efforts to reach a consensual solution through mediation in 2017, though this was not possible. We note that Mr Edmonds is now planning to formally file his legal claim next month. We are content for the matter to be considered by a court if he pursues his legal action.

That could allow Apple to put the phone back on sale at a lower price.Apple designer Jony Ive explains his \u0027utterly absurd\u0027 way of workingThe new handsets released in September were available at an increased price compared with previous years: the new iPhone XR, pitched as the more affordable model, begins at the same price the top-end phones had been marketed at until the iPhone X came along.Instead of buying those new phones, customers have been opting for the iPhone 8, according to numerous reports. Price-conscious customers are realising they could buy last year\u0027s handset instead for a much lower cost\u0026nbsp– despite it not featuring the brand new iPhone design – and that is thought to be having an impact on sales of the more expensive models.It is not clear when the iPhone X will be re-introduced to the line-up, or even if it will make it back onto sale. The iPhone X features an almost identical design to the iPhone XS, but misses out on new features such as an improved camera and upgraded processor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour.

This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time.

But as\u0026nbspSean O’Grady\u0026nbspexplains, she is following in a long Conservative tradition\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentBattles over the UK\u0027s relationship with the continent have blighted successive Tory premiershipsCould Europe be enough to wreck yet another Tory premiership?As Theresa May faces prospective votes of no confidence,\u0026nbspin her leadership from her own MPs, and in her government from internal dissidents and opposition parties, it may be scant comfort that she would hardly be the first Conservative leader to see their dreams and ambitions destroyed by a subject – Europe – that is seemingly incapable of resolution.Indeed, May, punningly enough, exists as a sort of political mayflower – her\u0026nbsplife in office, be it long or short, devoted to one purpose only: Brexit. All the stuff about “burning injustices”, the high-minded schemes to reinvigorate the British economy with an “industrial strategy” – her own mild brand of corporatism – or the plight of the “just about managing” families has been subsumed by the question of Britain’s EU withdrawal.To use a modern phrase, her administration has not the “bandwidth” to deal with everything else as well as sort out Brexit in truth it doesn’t really have the capacity or the intellectual clout to deal with Brexit itself.\u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit in photos: a portrait of the West MidlandsIn order to break the blackmailing hold of her band of Eurosceptic fundamentalists – and, to be fair, the truculent resistance of the Europhiles – she sought her own mandate at the general election of 2017. In an inexplicably long campaign the British electorate did what they usually do when asked a question by a prime mister – they chose to answer a different one. Called upon to back her with the kind of resounding support that would give her the oomph needed to carry out her Lancaster House hardish Brexit plan, the British electorate instead decided to blow a large raspberry and vote in unthinkable numbers for Jeremy Corbyn.“Nothing has changed,” she foolishly said during yet another campaign cock-up. In reality everything changed when she lost her majority, her moral authority and her political autonomy. Ironically, from that moment on she was the captive of every voluble faction or personality persuaded they could do a better job than she could – and there was no shortage of those. It was quietly said that she wouldn’t lead her party into another general election, even after she had jettisoned her closest aides and handed a veto over her cabinet-making to the 1922 Committee. She indicated that she had got her party and the country into his mess – and would get them out of it. It might have been better all round if they’d just ditched her then but, as usual, her enemies were willing to wound but not to kill. (My apologies if that language seems too violently intemperate for our times)Those who refuse to contemplate consulting the British people would in my view make more likely our eventual exitThe outcome of the British general election of 2017 was, then, not the triumph of May and the Leavers, but the revenge of the Remainers. It has left its mark. Now May is chained to the radiator of the Democratic Unionist Party, whose illogical and inconsistent demands could only be carried out by means of ine intervention.Sad, as they say, but true and hardly unpredictable. We remember\u0026nbspall too well\u0026nbsphow David Cameron almost casually tossed away his place in history – which might otherwise have been relatively distinguished – with a pledge to hold an inout EU referendum. On 23 January 2013 – a day that should live in infamy – at a speech at the Bloomberg HQ in London, Cameron explained his rationale. To be fair, he had some good points to make:“Those who refuse to contemplate consulting the British people would in my view make more likely our eventual exit.“Simply asking the British people to carry on accepting a European settlement over which they have had little choice is a path to ensuring that when the question is finally put – and at some stage it will have to be – it is much more likely that the British people will reject the EU.“That is why I am in favour of a referendum. I believe in confronting this issue – shaping it, leading the debate. Not simply hoping a difficult situation will go away.”“First, the problems in the eurozone are driving fundamental change in Europe.Second, there is a crisis of European competitiveness, as other nations across the world soar ahead. And third, there is a gap between the EU and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years, and which represents a lack of democratic accountability and consent that is – yes – felt particularly acutely in Britain.”By the way, and as if to prove the sure touch, if not genius, for politics possessed by Tony Blair, the reaction of the ex-prime minister at the time to Cameron’s move is chillingly and amusingly prophetic:Travel Question: Will Brexit affect holidays in Spain?In the early 2010s, as the coalition cut its way to dismal poll ratings Cameron was, in truth, spooked by the rise of Nigel Farage and Ukip, capitalising on a widespread but inchoate set of grievances in post-financial crisis, post-austerity, “left-behind” Britain.Cameron feared being outflanked by them on the right, splitting the traditional Conservative vote and losing seats to Ed Miliband’s Labour Party. In a way his strategy succeeded – but too well. At the 2015 election, with the collapse in the Liberal Democrat vote, Labour’s rout in Scotland at the hands of the SNP and some recession in Ukip’s charge, very possibly because of Cameron’s referendum pledge, Cameron and his campaign manager George Osborne succeeded so far as to win an overall majority – the first Tory one since 1992. Instead of another round of coalition, with an even stronger Tory domination, they could steer their own course. Instead of being able to plead that “Nick Clegg won’t let me hold the referendum”, Cameron was forced to do so.Or was he? Back in 2015 and 2016 no one was much bothered. Europe hardly featured in the voters’ list of concerns, although immigration often did. Cameron might have got away with forgetting his promise (as he had before on a “cast-iron” one to hold a plebiscite on the Lisbon Treaty of 2009).In any event, Cameron was complacent and, like many, too mesmerised by the precedent of the 1975 vote, when the people tended to “follow the faces they trusted”, as the arch-Europhile Roy Jenkins remarkeCameron failed to see how times had changed, and how folk were more sceptical about “the establishment”, whipped up by Ukip. Cameron also refused to countenance “blue-on-blue” debates, which allowed Boris Johnson and Michael Gove to parade unchallenged directly by their Tory peers the Treasury’s “Project Fear”, by contrast, seemed implausible to many of the public.You can think of ex-ministers who are going around causing all sorts of trouble. We don’t want another three more of the bastards out there...So Cameron lost. He lost his party and his premiership, and he is now routinely relegated to the bottom of the historical premier premiership table, along with Sir Anthony Eden (Suez) and Neville Chamberlain (Munich), in their own ways also guilty of serious delusions about foreign policy. Maybe the memoir\u0026nbspCameron is composing in his £25,000 “shepherd’s cottage” will succeed in rehabilitating him.Before Cameron there was John Major. Like May today, Major faced a huge series of battles to get a European agreement through parliament: the Maastricht Treaty strengthened European integration, but also contained a series of British “opt-outs”, the most valuable being the right to keep the pound and avoid joining the ill-starred euro.Like May today as well, he had no overall majority for much of his time in parliament and a well-organised group of Eurosceptics tormenting him. Some crucial votes he only won with the support of the 20 or so Liberal Democrats, then led by Paddy Ashdown, prepared to put country before party Labour was uniformly hostile to Major’s legislation, though agreeing with almost everything in it.Eurosceptics (AFPGetty)Major, like May, had a gang of leaky Eurosceptics in cabinet permanently causing trouble. In an unguarded moment in front of a live mic, he let slip his true feelings:“Just think it through from my perspective. You are the prime minister, with a majority of 18, a party that is still harking back to a golden age that never was, and is now invented. You have three right-wing members of the cabinet who actually resign. What happens in the parliamentary party?“I could bring in other people. But where do you think most of this poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. You can think of ex-ministers who are going around causing all sorts of trouble.“We don’t want another three more of the bastards out there. What’s Lyndon Johnson’s maxim?...”May must feel the same way about today’s “gang of five”, the “pizza club” of Leadsom, Gove, Fox, Grayling and Mordaunt. And, indeed, about Michael Howard, Peter Lilley and John Redwood, still banging the same drum as they did in Major’s cabinet a quarter century ago. (At least Michael Portillo has gone off to play with trains and model garishly coloured blazers.)ITVRex)Major survived his own leadership crisis over Europe, one he felt he had to end himself by, shockingly, resigning his position as party leader (but not prime minister) and inviting his enemies to “put up or shut up”. John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, did so and scored respectably, but ultimately lost. So Major carried on, his authority scarcely enhanced before he was slaughtered by Blair in 1997. It was the Tories’ worst thrashing since 1832. As he himself said within weeks, it was time to “leave the stage”.When Major claimed that his foes were “still harking back to a golden age that never was, and is now invented”, it was plainly a reference to the Thatcher premiership – which remains to this day a golden age for the right of the Conservative Party and their fellow travellers in Ukip – the likes of Arron Banks and Farage explicitly declaring their devotion to her.\u0026nbspIn many ways the Leave campaign was a movement that sought to bring back Thatcherism, the EU being regarded as a pettifogging, bureaucratic,\u0026nbspeven socialist\u0026nbspbarrier to the return of free enterprise, low tax\u0026nbspand the small-state policies of the 1980s. It was, if you will, a campaign for Mrs Thatcher’s fourth term in office, the one she never got to deliver.Eurosceptics (KeystoneHulton ArchiveGetty)The allegiance to Thatcher was, however, of the late-vintage Thatcher – the one who, when she reached the Lords, was happy to vote against her own party on Maastricht the one who made the landmark Bruges speech in 1988, a sort of Old Testament for Eurosceptics. A brief extract gives its flavour:“We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain\u0026nbsponly to see them reimposed at a European level with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.“Certainly we want to see Europe more united and with a greater sense of common purpose.“But it must be in a way which preserves the different traditions, parliamentary powers and sense of national pride in one’s own country for these have been the source of Europe’s vitality through the centuries.”Pure prototype Ukip, you might say. Yet she also declared in that same address, less comfortably for the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Farage:“The lesson of the economic history of Europe in the Seventies and Eighties is that central planning and detailed control\u0026nbspdo not\u0026nbspwork and that personal endeavour and initiative\u0026nbspdo that a state-controlled economy is a recipe for low growth and that free enterprise within a framework of law brings better results.“The aim of a Europe open to enterprise is the moving force behind the creation of the single European market in 1992. By getting rid of barriers, by making it possible for companies to operate on a European scale, we can best compete with the United States, Japan and other new economic powers emerging in Asia and elsewhere.”Margaret Thatcher, the longest serving peacetime premier of the 20th century, left office on 22 November\u0026nbsp1990. She did so for four manifest reasons. First, what was called “style” – an increasingly imperious manner. Second, a deepening economic recession.

At the time the Conservative Party had many more European true believers at its head than today and when the then-leader of the Commons, Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned in protest at the prime minister’s dismissive approach to Europe, she was fatally damaged. Her words at prime minister’s questions were the final straw for Howe, Michael Heseltine and the other Europhiles, and they echo down the years:Biggest rise in UK poverty since Thatcher was in power, experts claimThree weeks later she had had to quit, but not until she had had time to refuse\u0026nbspa request from the Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, to hold a general election so the British people could make their own choice about her successor. Plus ça change.The trouble for the Tories over Europe goes further back still. Britain’s first, belated attempt to join the then European Economic Community (EEC) was rejected after a few years of negotiations in 1963 – because of a French veto. After President Charles\u0026nbspde Gaulle said “non” to the UK, the fortunes of the Conservative movement declined markedly.The prime minister responsible\u0026nbspfor the bid, Harold Macmillan, saw it as the great strategic purpose of his administration:\u0026nbspthe way to find a role in the world as the British empire was being dismantled, and a way to boost the UK’s sluggish growth by joining in with the fastest growing economic bloc (apart from Japan) at the time. Macmillan, in the end, failed and his government was defeated by\u0026nbspLabour in 1964.In fact the only Tory leader to remotely prosper from Europe was Ted Heath, who was Macmillan’s chief negotiator – the reverse of a Brexit secretary – and went on to be the Tory PM who took the UK in to the EEC in 1973.Even there, though, the effort left some bad feelings among the small band of Tory proto-Eurosepctics, led by Enoch Powell, a man in love with parliament and fixated by sovereignty. More concerned with immigration, his hatred of the EEC was visceral, and his advice to Tory voters in marginal seats in the West Midlands in the 1974 election to vote Labour – because they\u0026nbsp were offering a referendum on staying in the EEC – was pivotal in pushing Heath out of No 10. So, in his way, even Heath was a victim of his party’s troubled and ambiguous relationship to the European issue.So there they are then: Macmillan, Heath, Thatcher, Cameron, May. Europe has haunted the Tories for almost seven decades, ever since Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan politely said “no” to an invitation to join attempts to create a European Community in the 1950s.Wrangling about Europe also badly distracted the Tories in opposition under William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith. The floor is littered with other political corpses and zombie policies (remember Hague’s “Save the Pound”?). Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine never became leader of their party because they were too pro-European. Others, such as Johnson and Gove, have\u0026nbspfound their anti-European crusading not quite sufficient to carry them into No 10, mainly because most of the parliamentary party remained relatively relaxed about the EU – epitomised by, say, Amber Rudd and\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond, as well as Cameron and Osborne.Further back in the mists of history, all the way back to the mid-19th century, we find the Conservatives split about protectionism and “imperial preference” as against global free trade. The issue came back time and again to mither Tory statesmen from Robert Peel to Stanley Baldwin. Only the Second World War forced them to take their minds off trade policy.The last Tory leader to talk much sense about Europe was in fact the Mark I David Cameron, the one who in 2006 told his party simply to “stop banging on about Europe”.Whatever happened to that idea?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Back to holidays!Created with Sketch.The 40 best albums to listen to before you die Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century.

Nasa will livestream the proceedings, and they will be covered as they happen here on\u0026nbspThe Independent.That descent is not guaranteed, and comes amid concern and upset about the future of the Opportunity rover. There have been numerous failed missions to Mars: from the European Space Agency\u0027s\u0026nbspSchiaparelli\u0026nbsplander, which smashed into the surface in 2016 at such speed it could not have survived, all the way back to the original Soviet missions in the 1970s which repeatedly failed.This time around, we\u0027ll get to know if it\u0027s successful straight away. That\u0027s thanks to two little flying robots known as CubeSats – named WALL-E and EVE after the main characters in the 2008 animated film – which went to Mars on the same rocket that is carrying the new lander and will fly past the Red Planet, relaying messages about its progress to\u0026nbspground controllers nearly 100 million miles away.Once the lander arrives on Mars, it will sit stationary and begin its work, looking deep underneath the surface for clues about what is going on there. Using seismometers to measure the movement of the ground, and a heat probe to take its temperature, scientists will get their first look at what is happening deep in Mars – and hopefully provide some clues about how it formed and more.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation.

It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. After gesturing that Reeves’s part would be very small, Allen went on to reiterate Woody voice actor Tom Hanks’s sentiment that the upcoming sequel would be very emotional, likening the final scene to Gone With the Wind.\u0026nbspToy Story 4 second teaser introduces new characters Ducky and Bunny“Hanks said it best — of course he always says stuff best — but the last scene of the movie I couldn’t even get through it,” he said.\u0026nbsp”I thought there were pages after it. I read it and I had to turn around from reading it in the studio, it was so emotional. It’s a ‘Scarlett, I don’t give a damn moment.’”Multiple new characters have already been unveiled to join the movie, but all already have actors attached, including\u0026nbspForky, who will be voiced by Tony Hale. The character was\u0026nbspfirst revealed in the teaser trailer for\u0026nbspToy Story 4.\u0026nbspThe film opens\u0026nbspin cinemas on 21 June\u0026nbsp2019.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.”Ms Rudd also cast doubt on Ms May’s plans to seal the Brexit deal at a summit with EU leaders on Sunday, acknowledging there are still obstacles in the way.“Hopefully it will get through this week,” she said, adding: “There is still a negotiation going on in terms of actually getting this agreement through.”The comments make Ms Rudd the first cabinet minister to rule out a no-deal Brexit – and the first to suggest an agreement at European level could yet be derailed.They came as the prime minister prepared to head to Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, under huge pressure for further “wins” in the final text.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

She will also hold last minute-talks on Saturday with Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission.The prime minister\u0026nbspwas dealt a fresh blow ahead of the summit when Dominic Raab, who resigned as her Brexit secretary last week, said the\u0026nbspproposed exit deal was worse than remaining in the EU.Leave would win again if fresh Brexit referendum held – Diane AbbottDespite the growing backlash from her own backbenchers, the prime minister told a BBC Radio 5 Live phone-in that she remain determined to ensure the deal is approved by the Commons.\u0026nbspAsked whether she might resign\u0026nbspif the\u0026nbspplan is rejected, she said: “I’m focused on actually ensuring that we do get this deal through parliament, because I believe that this is absolutely the right deal for the UK.”Pushed\u0026nbspon whether she could resign, she added: “This isn’t about me. As I’m sitting here, I’m not thinking about me, I’m thinking about getting a deal through that delivers for the people\u0026nbspof this country. That’s what drives me and that is what’s at the forefront of my mind.”Asked for a third time if she might quit, she said simply: “My focus is on getting this deal through.”The prime minister also refused to say definitively\u0026nbspthat she believes her Brexit deal is\u0026nbspbetter for the UK than remaining in the EU.She said: “I honestly believe that I’m getting a good\u0026nbspdeal for\u0026nbspthe UK.“I recognise that there were aspects of being in the European Union that caused people\u0026nbspreal concern, and free movement was one of those.”Ms May said\u0026nbspthat, despite having campaigned for Remain, she “wasn’t one of those who said that if we leave the EU, it will be really bad for the UK –\u0026nbspI actually said the sky won’t fall in”.She said Brexit would create a “different world, but it will be a good one”, adding: “I genuinely believe\u0026nbspthere’s a bright future for this country and our best days lie ahead of us.”Created with Sketch.

You said ‘better\u0026nbspoff’ but actually it’s a different sort of environment and a different approach that we’ll be taking to things.”Asked again if her deal would be better than the status quo, she said: “It’s going to be different and I believe we can build a better future outside the European Union.”Earlier in the day, Mr Raab said MPs would “inevitably” vote down Ms May’s plan, which he claimed\u0026nbspwas worse than EU membership.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I’m not going to advocate staying in the EU.“But, if you just presented me terms, this deal or EU membership, because we would effectively be bound by the same rules but without the control or voice over them, yes, I think this would be even worse than that.”Ms May’s talks with Mr Juncker\u0026nbspare likely to focus on how the EU could help her sell the deal at home, but UK and EU leaders will also need to ensure it receives the backing of the 27 other\u0026nbspmember states.\u0026nbspThe Spanish government is threatening\u0026nbspto oppose the proposal unless changes are made in relation to\u0026nbspGibraltar.\u0026nbspUp to 80 Conservative MPs\u0026nbsphave also threatened to vote against Ms May’s proposed agreement when it is put before the Commons, casting doubts over her ability to get it through parliament.Some MPs believe she would then have to return to Brussels to negotiate a different deal.However, the prime minister warned her critics that the EU will not offer further concessions.She said: “If we were to go back to the European Union and say, ‘People didn’t like that deal, can we have another one?’ I don’t think they are going to come to us and say, ‘We will give you a better deal.’“This is the deal that I think works for the UK.”And she warned MPs that\u0026nbsprejecting\u0026nbspher plan would lead to more “uncertainty and ision” and insisted the public wants politicians to deliver Brexit.She said: “In parliament there’s a lot of focus on who’s going to vote for the deal or not, and outside I think people are thinking, ‘Actually, let’s make sure we can get this through and get on with delivering.’“If this deal doesn’t go through we are back at square one. What we end up with is more uncertainty and more ision.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It delivers on the vote of the referendum. It brings back control of our borders, our money and our laws.And it does so while protecting jobs, protecting our security and protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom.She added: The British people want this to be settled. They want a good deal that sets us on course for a brighter future. That deal is within our grasp and I am determined to deliver it.Empty House of Commons during the draft Brexit statement given by Theresa May (Image: Universal News And Sport (Europe))The political declaration - designed to form the basis of a new trade deal to be thrashed out after Britain quits the EU next year - promised an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership between Britain and the bloc.It said trade will be underpinned by provisions ensuring a level playing field for open and fair competition while respecting the integrity of the Union\u0027s single market and customs union as well as the UK\u0027s internal market while confirming EU free movement for migrants to travel to the UK would end.The deal was signed off by the Cabinet in a hastily arranged conference call yesterday.A Downing Street source said: There was strong support for the declaration that has been negotiated. The Cabinet agreed it overall and on specific areas of ministerial responsibility.Dominic Raab, resigned as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union  (Image: Dan KitwoodGetty Images)Mrs May was given strong public backing from Home Secretary Sajid Javid last night. In an interview in Westminster\u0027s The House magazine, he said: \u0026ldquoI think that the draft agreement the Prime Minister has reached with our EU friends delivers on the referendum.The country made a clear decision, it delivered instructions to the politicians and we have to obey those instructions.\u0026ldquoWhat the Prime Minister has worked on is a deal that I believe delivers on that. It gives us back control of our laws, of our money and our borders.Reporting her deal to the Commons, the Prime Minister told MPs: The British people want Brexit to be settled they want a good deal that sets us on a course for a brighter future and they want us to come together as a country and to move on to focus on the big issues at home, like our NHS.Britain is to quit the EU next year (Image: Chris RatcliffeBloomberg Getty Images)The deal that will enable us to do this is now within our grasp.In these crucial 72 hours ahead, I will do everything possible to deliver it for the British people.But in another gruelling question-and-answer session at the Commons dispatch box, the Prime Minister weathered a series of attacks from Tory heavyweights about the so-called Northern Ireland backstop.Mr Johnson, the former foreign secretary, told her the plan made a complete nonsense of Brexit.He said:\u0026nbsp We should junk forthwith the backstop, upon which the future economic partnership - according to this political declaration - is to be based, and which makes a complete nonsense of Brexit.Theresa May and EU Council President Donald Tusk in Brussels (Image: Thierry MonasseGetty Images)Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab warned the deal would do the opposite of giving the country back control.The backstop ties the UK to the customs union and single market rules with no voice and an EU veto over our exit whilst paragraph 23 of the political declaration makes that the starting point for future relations to build on.The top reason people voted to leave the EU was to take back control over our laws. Isn\u0027t it the regrettable but inescapable reality that this deal gives even more away?Former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers said: The withdrawal agreement locks us in to paying the \u0026pound38 billion and also commits us to a backstop which has us obeying their rules and applying their customs rules without any say over them.                What is the withdrawal agreement? What is the political declaration?                Brexiteer leaves radio host speechless as he SHOUTS against May\u0027s dealIn her statement, the Prime Minister confirmed she had won concessions from the EU that will encourage high-tech customs checks to be used to try to prevent the need for a hard border as an alternative to the backstop.She acknowledged that Mr Duncan Smith and former Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson had helped with ideas about the plan.But both former ministers told the Commons they could still not back the plan in its current form.Mr Duncan Smith urged her to strip out the backstop while Mr Paterson said the measure threatened the horror of Northern Ireland being split off.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, chief whip of Mrs May\u0027s parliamentary allies in the Democratic Unionist Party, called on the Prime Minister to dump the backstop and come forward with the alternatives set out in the political declaration instead.He said: If she wants to have the support of my party for the withdrawal agreement then we need to see an end to the backstop and those alternative arrangements put in place.Pro-Brussels Tories also attacked the deal, with some calling for a fresh referendum.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn condemned the political declaration as 26 pages of waffle.Theresa Villiers, former Northern Ireland Secretary (Image: Simon DawsonBloomberg via Getty Images)He said: The only certainty contained within these pages is that the transition period will have to be extended or we will end up with a backstop and no exit.It represents the worst of all worlds, no say over the rules that will continue to apply and no certainty to the future.Tory whips were beginning the challenging task of trying to win over sceptical backbenchers last night.A senior Tory source said: We will be seeking to persuade all of our colleagues on the Conservative benches that this is a good deal for the country that delivers on the referendumLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn condemned the political declaration as 26 pages of waffle (Image: Jason AldenBloomberg via Getty Images)It takes back control of borders, money and laws and does that while protecting jobs and security.Tory Brexiteer MPs gave the Prime Minister an early taste of the opposition within her party to the deal within an hour of its publication.Senior Tory backbencher Sheryll Murray said: \u0026ldquoIn the EU referendum people voted to taken back control of our fish. Yet now the Prime Minister wants to commit us to stay in the Common Fisheries Policy in all but name.She seeks to enter a new fisheries agreement on access to waters and quota shares. Let\u0026rsquos be clear. This is a betrayal of Brexit.The Brexit draft (Image: Thierry MonasseGetty Images)Former Cabinet minister Priti Patel said: \u0026ldquoEverything the EU wanted from the negotiations has ended up in the Withdrawal Agreement \u0026ndash which is a legally enforceable international treaty.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why we\u0026rsquore going to stay in the EU customs union, remain subject to judgments of the European Court, imperil our Union and allow the EU to have a veto over when we can leave the backstop.\u0026ldquoEverything the UK wanted has been put in an unenforceable, meaningless declaration.\u0026nbsp And it\u0026rsquos cost us \u0026pound39billion.\u0026ldquoThis is a costly surrender by the UK Government.Scottish Secretary David Mundell (Image: Jack TaylorGetty Images)Simon Clarke, another Eurosceptic Tory backbencher, said: \u0026ldquoThe political declaration is a well-meaning but ultimately meaningless set of words.\u0026ldquoAll the perils of the Withdrawal Agreement would bind the UK with the force of an international treaty.\u0026nbsp It will lock us into the EU customs union, subject us to the European Court\u0026rsquos judgments, threaten our union, give the EU the power to say when we can leave the backstop and cost the UK \u0026pound39billion.\u0026ldquoAnd anything we wanted from the negotiations has been trumpeted in a political declaration which has absolutely no legal effect on anyone.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThis is a declaration of surrender by the UK Government.PM Theresa May declares that her Brexit deal is  (Image: Getty)Ranil Jayawardena, who quit as a ministerial aide last week in protest at the deal, said: \u0026ldquoThis isn\u0027t a settlement it\u0027s a surrender.\u0026ldquoInstead of taking back control, we will be abandoning control over vast swathes of our social and economic policy - and we will be simply unable to agree the trade deals of tomorrow with the rest of the world.This \u0027deal\u0027 stops us seizing the benefits of Brexit, whilst shackling us to the worst parts of the EU.\u0026ldquoThis is not a good and fair Brexit. It is not fair to the 17.4 million people who voted to leave in 2016, and isn\u0027t good enough for many who voted to remain either.

In any case, further negotiations would only be possible if other European countries were also prepared to continue.A late \u0026ldquono vote could also be followed by further negotiations, but only if the two-year window dictated by Article 50 is extended.That can only happen with the unanimous agreement of the other member states. It is not within MPs\u0027 remit to extend the negotiating period unilaterally.It is also still unclear whether Parliament will be able to vote in favour or against a no deal scenario despite Amber Rudd\u0027s statement MPs would stop a no deal outcome.The Work and Pensions Secretary said: \u0026ldquoThat vote when it comes to it, people have to consider, and I know all my colleagues will, very carefully, whether, on the balance, they think that delivering on the referendum result and this deal, is going to give the right outcome for the country.\u0026ldquoIf it doesn\u0026rsquot get through, anything could happen.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” Irish officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom. Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0003390043191.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"no deal mars bar brexit jane moore","story":"The operative word being “could”, of course.

After all, the notion that Merkel, Macron et al will bite off their own electorate’s noses to spite Britain’s volte face on EU membership is an absolute nonsense.In a letter to The Times yesterday, the chairman of pub chain JD Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, wrote: “The great urban myth, promoted by advocates of the deadly exchange rate mechanism, the euro and Remain, is that a ‘deal’ with the EU is a prerequisite of future prosperity.”The reality, he says, is that no deal would allow us to join successful countries such as Canada, Singapore, Israel and Australia in the free-trading world and “by slashing the EU’s , protectionist tarfs, shop prices will fall, with no loss to the Treasury, since tarf income is currently remitted to Brussels”.On top of that, we won’t have to pay the £billion orce bill, will regain control of our fishing waters, borders and laws and, ultimately, all have more money in our pockets.

In , we expect our national broadcaster to reflect all our opinions even-handedly.We don’t want the BBC to tell us that one side is right and the other wrong, or what we should believe, or which opinions are “true” and which are “”.But that is what the BBC has started to do, at least on the subject of Brexit.The BBC tried to be reasonably balanced during the referendum campaign, but it was so upset by the outcome that it has abandoned any attempt at impartiality and become grotesquely one-sided.The views of Remainers are not just over-represented, they are rarely challenged. And scare stories about Brexit which are either exaggerated or completely imaginary are presented as fact.I decided to compile a list of myths about Brexit — particularly scare stories about what will happen when we leave the Customs Union orwe leave Europe without a deal.Then I compared them with the facts. Although the pamphlet did not mention the BBC, most of the myths were things we hear daily on its programmes.The BBC rose to the bait and invited me into the Today programme on Radio  yesterday to be grilled by John Humphrys, its star interviewer. It was a fair enough interview. He challenged my arguments but I was able to refute his claims point by point.However, they then brought on a chap called Chris Morris, described as the BBC “reality checker”, who was invited to rebut my document. But all he did was oppose my facts with the opinions of people with whom he agreed.He systematically argued the Remain case and defended their Project Fear scare stories. The one thing he did not do was bring in any new facts. My central claim was thatwe leave the EU Customs Union but have a free trade agreement with the European Union, our businesses have little to fear.The main dference will be that traders will have to send in a customs declaration detailing the goods they are buying from or selling to Europe.That is a nuisance which we should try to simply as much as possible.But allegations that “this will be hugely costly, cause y delays, disrupt supply chains and undermine economic growth” are imaginary or exaggerated.“Fact checker” Morris said the majority of trade experts and freight companies to whom he had spoken robustly disagreed with me. This is an opinion, not a fact.Surely,trading in a free trade area — like that which exists between Switzerland and the EU or between Canada and the US — is so intolerable, the people there would be calling for a customs union.But they aren’t. I prefer their practical experience to the speculation of Mr Morris’s contacts.I also quoted a report by the CLECAT organisation, which covers , companies handling  per cent of the freight and customs in Europe, who said: “All the ingredients to ensure a smooth exit process of the UK from the EU, and which allow almost frictionless trade after the exit, are already available.”Why should a BBC fact checker’s unnamed contacts count for more than their considered view He then claimed there are no checks at the border at present. I go across to my house in France frequently and see the checks — for drugs, illegal immigrants, alcohol, cigarettes.And companies have to report all their cross-border trade separately on their VAT s and provide statistical s to Brussels.Then Mr Morris claimed there would be more checks by our customs officers at Dover, resulting in delays and disruption. That is nonsense.The Head of Customs and Revenue has said it only stops and searches lorries at present where it has intelligence information about drugs, illegal immigrants, and goods such as tobacco and alcohol, upon which excise duty is paid.It does not expect any of these risks to become more frequent. So it will not need to search any more vehicles.As I was still in the studio, I was able to rebut his pathetic attempts to rebut my facts. Normally he gets a clear run.But what is intolerable is that he almost never tries to rebut arguments by those trying to overturn the referendum result.I asked him afterwards to name a single Remainer whose case he had attempted to dissect. When he replied that there were “lots”, I said it should be easy to name one and, after repeated challenges, he named Jeremy Corbyn.The idea that Mr Corbyn — a man who has voted more often against European membership than any other MP and went on holiday during the referendum — is a Remainer could only be taken for reality by a BBC reality checker.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As The Sun always predicted, they’re now after everything  . . . yoghurts, cereals, takeaways, you name it.They claim customers want the food industry to cut sugar — and that the Government must use “fiscal levers”needed to enforce it. That’s a weasel phrase meaning “new taxes consumers will end up paying”.Yes, obesity is a problem. But the reality of this demented war on the calories and sugar in our food supply — in place of educating Brits about diet and exercise — is blander grub or smaller portions . . . inevitably for the same price.Shoppers will then rightly turn on these same un-Conservative politicians and nanny-state meddlers who foolishly thought we were all onboard.WITH every utterance, Justice Secretary David Gauke makes his Government’s shambolic stance over the John Worboys parole scandal worse.There is no case for  members remaining anonymous. And to dismiss their role as “administrative” is crass.We still don’t know who decided to free the rapist, nor who rightly overturned that judgement. But we should.Parole  often make rulings with le-or-death implications for the ­public. They must be as accountable and identiable as any judge.Mr Gauke is normally one of the Government’s most unflappable performers.

Love is a Gt has now hit the million view mark.All the feels around the nation! Thanks to everyone who is sharing out short film.A special film with a special message.Congratulations Phil Beastall on this achievement - this didnt happen by chance or sheer luck - this happened because you are a talented filmmaker and a wonderful storyteller.Good work deserves to be seen - you deserve this.And she added last night: Our no budget film seems to be receiving all the love and stealing some thunder!The nation has been left weeping this week after the film, shot in , resurfaced and reminded people of the true message of Christmas.Chris, who has since gone on to co-found COBA Digital, posted today: A short film I was a part of  years ago seems to have gained huge traction in the past hrs, created by the talented Phil Beastall - and although I’m pleased to say my appearance has changed for the better - the message is still as relevant now as it was then.Since the emotional tale went viral, Phil has been inundated with messages from fans who claim the video could have been used instead of the expensive Elton John-themed John Lewis advert.Others have suggested the store hire him to make their Christmas ad for .Among those welling up after viewing the ad was Good Morning Britain host Ben Shephard who admitted on todays show he couldnt watch it without crying.The young filmmaker told the show he got the moving idea for the film while on a run.He said: To be honest, it was just a last minute decision really. Im a bit of a kind of frustrated film maker and I wanted to get a Christmas film out there.It was just when I was on a run on a Sunday and I just came up with this idea and I just really wanted to create something that would resonate with people as I thought especially in todays society we kind of just need that reminder that we are not really defined by our careers and materialism, actually family does come first.So ultimately I just wanted to create something that was emotive and what resonated with people and maybe they would turn to their wives, husbands, kids whatever and give them a cuddle and say I love you.Phil, from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, said he was a fan of the John Lewis ad, but added: “People seem to like my film because it’s the story that shines through. You don’t always need a huge budget, just an impactful narrative that gets the message across.”Thousands of commentators praised the video online and admitted that it had reduced them to tears.Melanie Thomas wrote: In tears. I have no words except John Lewis, tell your advertising team they [are] sacked. “Stop plugging Elton Johns song and get this man to do your adverts.Lisa Darling said: Best advert ever, maybe John Lewis should pay him a million.The response was so overwhelming that Phil conceded defeat in trying to respond to all the comments because the video attracted so much attention.Most touchingly, Phil received messages of thanks from parents who have lost a child and also children whose parents are no longer alive because the video had a positive impact on them.Phil said: “A lot of people are saying how it has touched them and made them feel that they can cope a little bit more this Christmas, which is amazing.“I never expected that at all. To think people are getting so much from my film.“I am blown away.”Phil made the video in  but was inspired to share it again now after seeing the Elton John advert on TV.The John Lewis advert cost £million to make, a fortune compared to the small budget production Love is a Gt, which cost less than £.Professional videographer Phil dedicated the emotive and video to the selflessness of his partner of ten years Claire Higley, the mother of their children Ethan, Eliza and Zara.The man in the video has to finally let go of his mother on the most family-orientated of days and Phil wanted to celebrate the le that has rewarded him with his we and mother to his children.John Lewis declined to comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000406141674-e1540908854709.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"benefits freeze state pension 2019","story":"From April Brits will see their benefit payments from the government frozen yet again, but the state pension will go up by £. a week from to £. - a £ boost.The Tories triple lock means that pensions have to rise in line with inflation, earnings growth of . per cent - whichever is highest.This year that was . per cent, measured through the average rise in wages.The old state pension will rise from £. to £..Brits on maternity pay will see a slight boost from £. a week to £..But for most Brits who are claiming any kind of benefits - including Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support or Housing benefit, the rates will stay the same.The majority of working age benefits have been frozen at the   levels, meaning they wont get hiked in line with inflation.Ministers have faced calls to end the benefits freeze, with experts saying it will list , out of poverty.The Resolution Foundation said the continuing benefits freeze next year would leave low-income households more than £ a year worse off.Single parents could be as much as £ poorer.Adam Corlett, Senior Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “It is not too late to change course, end the freeze and ensure low and middle income families’ benefits keep pace with the rising cost of living.”Steve Webb, Director of Policy at Royal London said today there was now a huge gap between pensioners and working age adults.He blasted: Linking pensions and pension credit to earnings whilst freezing working age benefits yet again means that the minimum income for retired people is now roughly double that available to unemployed people under pension age.It is hard to think that these benefit rates are a fair reflection of the relative cost of living of the dferent groups’.Labours Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, Margaret Greenwood said today: This shows austerity is far from over.

If theres a worse one in the country Ill sit on the top myself.”The picture shows a forlorn-looking tree, sparsely decorated with only a few baubles on it.The council though said it had not yet been properly decorated and it was still a “living tree” which still has to grow.Rebecca added: They’d have a job decorating that to anything of any decent standard it [looks like] its been there since last year!She also claimed other locals had been far from impressed by the tree, saying they were “going mad on Facebook”.Rebecca told The Mirror:  Last years was a big joke among residents but everyone is really disappointed with this years.The council replied to the tweet to say the local traders are planning to decorate it and do a switch on but a lot of people feel it shouldn’t be down to them.It isn’t a criticism of the town or the people at all. The traders and residents do their best to make the best of a bad situation but the authorities should afford a bit more money and effort into making the town festive and providing some care to a tree that is half dead.”Askedshe would carry out her promise of sitting on top of the treea worse-looking one was found, she replied: “I dont think the tree would hold my weight - it can barely hold the three baubles its currently featuring.”Councillor Stephen Hellier, local ward councillor, said: “We are working together as a community in Tyldesley to make the town centre look festive and welcoming to residents and visitors.“The tree is a living tree and yet to grow to its full height. We will be decorating it later this week and we are looking forward to welcoming the people of Tyldesley to a successful switch-on event on December .A spokesman for Wigan Council told The Sun Online: “The Tyldesley Christmas tree is a living tree installed as part of the guided busway improvements to Tyldesley Market Square in .“As the tree is a living one it is yet to grow to its full height.“The full decoration of the tree for this Christmas has yet to take place with traders in Tyldesley coming together to decorate it later this week and Wigan Council providing festive decoration to the fence surrounding the tree.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004513135881.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"vigilantes 10 cops for 92000 hartlepool residents","story":"The citizens’ patrol, tired of police inaction on their streets, have chanced upon two possibly dangerous suspected villains.Insisting they are not vigilantes, taxi driver Stephen Picton tells me about the Thursday night encounter: “One was perched on the awning above the front door of a house.“I thought he was going to break in. The other was keeping watch. I was worried they may have weapons.”Renowned locally for his charity work, Stephen — one of three volunteers on the .am patrol — says he shone his light in the perched intruder’s face as a pal rang the cops.In the darkness, Stephen told the suspects: “You’ve got ten seconds to get your a**es out of here. I know what you look like now. Do one.”For here in Hartlepool, folk have begun taking the law into their own hands. This week the gritty North Sea port was described as “the town where police have given up”.With a population of ,, Hartlepool has just ten officers on duty overnight. And a BBC investigation found that on one recent Saturday, all ten were tied up with incidents, leaving none to respond to  calls.The local force, Cleveland Police, has had nearly £million cut from its budget since  and has shed  officers. This week it announced the mothballing of Hartlepool’s custody suite, meaning that from next year, arrested suspects will have to be driven  miles to Middlesbrough to be questioned.Many locals I spoke to in Hartlepool this week say police have simply stopped responding to some calls.It is little wonder, many argue, that crime rates in the County Durham town — especially involving violence — have soared.Some here have even taken to Facebook to try to solve crimes when threadbare policing let them down.One member, Darren Price, , says: “We feel we’ve no option but to try to look after ourselves.“People are scared, especially at night. It is vans and houses getting broken into, anti-social behaviour.“We don’t blame the police. It is like the NHS, we know it is under-staffed and morale is low. We are just trying to give a helping hand.“We don’t encourage anybody on the patrols to engage with anybody who commits a crime, all we ask is to report it to the police.”Another member, self-employed gas engineer Paul Timlin was unable to work when cops failed to turn up for two weeks after he had £,-worth of tools stolen earlier this year.Outside his neat semi in the Hart Station area, he shows me how the thieves — “most likely druggies,” he says — were captured by his CCTV cameras ransacking his work van.Paul, , tells me: “I went down to the police station and told them I had CCTV but got no real response other than a crime number.“People behind the desk said it was a low-grade crime as far as they were concerned. But to me it was a valuable set of tools and the theft stopped me working.“I had to replace them quickly or I’d lose money daily, so I put my CCTV video on Facebook that day. People identied one of the guys.”Paul says he “knows a few people who know a few people”. A phone call was made to the villain saying: “Those tools need to be ed.”He adds: “Within the next day or two we got the tools back.”Around two weeks later police finally arrived to take a statement from Paul. He handed over the CCTV and the name of the criminal.He says: “The police said they had a major incident in Stockton on the day of my theft and just didn’t have the numbers. A few weeks later I got a message saying the case was closed. No further action would be taken.”He says he felt uneasy taking the law into his own hands, but adds: “Unfortunately, the police haven’t got the bodies to deal with this sort of crime, that’s why it’s on the rise.“Criminals realise the police’s response time is low. Partof my council tax is allocated to the police, but that wasn’t cut when Cleveland Police reduced their numbers by .”In Hartlepool’s Foggy Furze district, locals have welcomed the patrols by Stephen and eight other volunteers.Retired forklt truck driver David Dodds, , says: “I hope it’s a deterrent. The police should be doing it but I feel for the officers. It’s not their fault there’s not enough money.”Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that , crimes were recorded from the year to March.This means a rate of  crimes per , residents during  to  - above the England and Wales average of .Gun and kne possession offences rose from o to  incidents, while theft shot up by  per cent.The latest police figures also reveal the number of robberies between April  and March  more than doubled.There were  robberies - including violent muggings - in the period, which is an increase of . per cent in - when  were reported.Hartlepool also has the highest level of crime across the force area.At the nearby Ye Olde Durhams Social Club, supervisor Jacqui Hunter serves afternoon pints to mainly retirees from Hartlepool’s heavy industries. Drinkers here overwhelmingly welcome the community patrols.Mum-of-two Jacqui, , says: “We had cars broken into at am. We caught it on CCTV and called police. That was in March. We’re still waiting for police to pick up the CCTV footage. They give you a crime number, then you wait for weeks and nothing happens.”Retired toolmaker Dick Massey, , says: “I had the lead pinched from the canopy above my door three weeks ago. I went to the police station the next day.“I expected them to come and have a look but they didn’t. They just gave me a crime number. I’m not happy about it. I pay my taxes.“I asked them why you never see any police about now and they said, ‘We haven’t got the numbers’.“I’m not surprised people are organising their own patrols.”Co-ordinated via Facebook, the Foggy Furze Neighbourhood Patrol insist the “vigilante” tag they have been labelled with is wrong.Taxi driver Stephen, , says of his early-hours encounter this week: “If we were vigilantes we would have had them on the floor, face down, with our knees in their backs. We’re a deterrent. We called police and, to be fair, they arrived in five minutes. We gave them a description of the men but they’d gone.”Recorded crime in Hartlepool is up  per cent in a year. There were  robberies between April  and March , up more than  per cent on the previous year.Gun and kne possession offences rose from  to , while theft is up by  per cent.Hartlepool’s Labour MP Mike Hill has called an urgent meeting with police chiefs and described the recent instance of too few cops to answer Saturday night emergency calls as “unacceptable”.He tells The Sun: “I don’t condone vigilantism in any form and don’t see that as an issue in Hartlepool. But, clearly, we’re a step closer towards that unless we get funding to see more bobbies on Hartlepool’s streets.”Cleveland’s Chief Constable Mike Veale admits: “The service we are providing the public is nowhere near where it needs to be.”In a statement he says: “I would not be exhibiting the courage that my officers and staff deserveI continue to say we have enough resources,I continue with this commentary that things in policing are OK. They are not OK.“The cuts created and caused by austerity are too deep and have gone on for too long. My message is clear — give us the tools and we will do the job.” Since  police funding nationally has fallen  per cent and officer numbers by ,.Writing in The Sun this week, former Hartlepool Detective Superintendent Ray Mallon — nicknamed Robocop for his zero-tolerance approach that cut crime by  per cent — said that “simply giving police more money does not make them more effective”.He added that officers should be taken from specialist units such as CID and put back on the beat.Yet Chief Constable Veale’s broadside will resonate in Whitehall, where Home Secretary Sajid Javid last week promised a “fresh look” at police funding.But until the thin blue line becomes thicker in Foggy Furze, Stephen and his friends will be out protecting their neighbourhood."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004513656161.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"bungle chow puppy released cops","story":"The puppy smothered his family with loving licks after being released from police custody.He then tore through the house with his owners’ other dogs, Newfoundlands Fluffy and Gigi, before settling down in front of the TV.Bungle was also greeted by Sun reporters dressed as TV favourites Zippy and George.Owners David and Susan Hayes and their -year-old son Joseph were relieved he was home after five days.Joseph said: “It must have been so awful for him but he looks ashe’s back to his old self already.”Five-month-old Bungle was taken away by police after he escaped from his home near Towcester, Northants, and nipped an officer.But he was ed within hours of The Sun campaigning for his release under the headline “I’m a silly puppy . . . get me out of here!”.Banker David, , said: “He was a bit dishevelled so he’ll need a good groom.

All those people, and children, packed like sardines in their caravans, watching the rain trickle down the windows on wet bank holidays, and having to go into the woods to ­defecate, like animals.Then I did some more checking and found that .BILLION people around the world don’t even have a toilet at home.And that a third of the planet’s schools also have no bogs of any kind.Of course, you may imagine thatyou’re going to make a donation to ­charity, you’d rather help buy a blind person a dog or look after a wounded soldier who’s down on his luck.You may also reckon that it’s better to give an African child food that his ­stomach can turn into a stool rather than a lavatory that can be used for ­getting rid of it.This was long before Range Rovers and patio heaters had been invented but even so, it was very hot.In June of that year, the average daytime ­temperature in London was  degrees . And on one day, it hit  .And back then there was no plumbing. Instead, everyone in the city simply relieved themselves into channels which carried the sewage to the Thames where, at low tide, it was six feet deep on the banks.The smell was unbearable and so was the disease. Thousands and thousands died every week from cholera and typhus.But then, on an early incarnation of ­Toilet Day, someone decided to build ­sewers and an embankment keeping the Thames and the city apart.And after all that was done, the death toll fell to just about zero.World Toilet Day then sounds like it should be a joke. But actually, it’s not funny at all.Unlike Wednesday, which was World ­Television Day. Again, I’m not sure how we were supposed to mark this.I watched the end of Narcos Mexico. Hope it helped.THIS is not funny. But when an American ­missionary called John Chau, pictured, heard about how the ancient tribesman on the remote North Sentinel Island between India and Burma were notoriously hostile to outsiders, he decided he must pay them a visit.He knew, of course, that the th Century explorer Marco Polo had described them as cannibals.He also knew that when a rescue helicopter ­hovered overhead after the  tsunami, they threw spears at it.But he was doing God’s work. It was important work. To convert the heathen.So off he set with hope in his heart and a song in his lungs.He paid fishermen to take him as close as they dared to the island and then he did the last bit of the journey in a canoe.Eventually, he reached the beach where he was promptly hit by an avalanche of arrows. Which killed him.And the incident can’t be investigated becausea policeman lands there, he will immediately be eaten.NO one knows how the Starship Enterprise works.

It actually flew for  metres before it crashed into a wall.That doesn’t sound like much.But let’s not forget that the Wright brothers only ­managed  metres on their first flight.

That’s nearly half a ­BILLION in two years.Even the Tories were cross, with one MP saying that no one in the country should be allowed to earn more than a million a year.Well, let’s think about that shall we Mrs Coates, who started the business herself, has donated more than £million to ious charities. She’s helped the victims of cancer, typhoons and even gave £, to a school in Stoke so they could help youngsters in Sierra Leone.She sounds to me like a very sound, very big-hearted and very good woman.And then there’s the small matter of how much tax she pays.As she still lives here, quietly, in Cheshire, it’ll be around  per cent of what she earns.Which means in the past two years, she’ll have given the Treasury about £million.That’s one taxpayer coughing up enough to build eight secondary schools.Which means she’s done a damn site more for the country and the world than some bitter and twisted MP who just wants to get her name in the papers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They have both failed to protect our children.Mr Newby kept his daughters away from the school after finding out about the pupil and only let themwhen he was certain the man was not going back.Sandy Martin, the Labour MP for Ipswich, said the Home Office “need to get their act together” to ensure adults cannot pose as children in the classroom.He said: “The Home Office needs to make sure that they are not sending people who are overage to school.“They have the means to do this and they need to do it. It doesn’t help the young people involved any more than it helps the schools.“I think the fact that it has had such a high profile in the news has made sure that the Home Office will do their job a bit better in the future, although the history of the Home Office doing its job a bit better isn’t very encouraging.”“He had chest hair and the body of a man. It beggars belief that it was ever allowed to happen.”An investigation was launched when a pupil posted a picture of their new classmate in unorm in a classroom on Snapchat with a message saying: “How’s there a -year-old man in our maths class ”Parents were shocked, and some even removed their children from the school as classmates shared old pictures of him on Facebook, showing him with a full beard, a hairy chest and swigging a beer.Sources confirmed that the ft in tall pupil who spoke poor English was assessed as being aged over  in an investigation ordered by the Home Office.While the Home Office has refused to reveal the newly-assessed age of the man - or any details of his background due to data protection issues - it is now understood that he is being treated as an adult asylum seeker.He could now face being thrown out of the UKhis claim for asylum is denied.A further probe into how he managed to pass as a student is being carried out.The stepfather of a girl in the same class as the pupil said he had gone to the school to complain before the man was removed and had contacted Suffolk Police to make a complaint that a grown man was “posing as a pupil” in her class.He said: “They logged my call and advised me to go back to the school and demand what action they were going to take.“I ended up speaking to this teacher who said that the Facebook picture of the boy was a case of mistaken identity.“The teacher actually threatened that all the parents who were jumping on the bandwagon could face legal action because complaining about the pupil was a criminal offence. He was basically calling all the parents bullies.“I explained that I was sorrythe pupil turned out to be a genuine -year-old, but that parents had a responsibility for the safeguarding of children in their care, as should the school.“The teacher told me that he had children himself and all the paperwork and been looked at for this person and had been passed by the Home Office. I was absolutely livid and was trying to behave myself.“He was so ignorant and not really listening to what I was saying. I wanted to kick him up the backside and tell him not to be so naïve. My last words to him were, “You have not heard the last about this”.The man started at Stoke High School which is run by the Ormiston Academies Trust soon after the start of term in September.Pupils became suspicious when they saw that the clean shaven pupil appeared to have the shadow of a beard on his face.They then discovered the Facebook profile in his name which described him as having been an architecture student at the Islamic Azad University in Abadan, Iran, before living in Erfurt, Germany.The pictures on the now deleted profile showed him with a beard and drinking a bottle of beer on a street, and also included an image of another -year-old boyIt was also claimed that the pupil bombarded a -year-old girl classmate with text messages, prompting her to complain to safeguarding staff – because she was worried about his true age.But the girl was told that there was nothing “sinister” about the texts as they were not of a sexual nature. When shown the alleged Facebook picture of the pupil with a beard, the teacher allegedly said that people matured at dferent ages. She stopped receiving messages from him after she complained.A mother of another pupil said the man had told her son that he was aged  and was married with two children when he was askedhe wanted to join in a game of football at break time.A Home Office spokesperson said: “When there is doubt about an inidual’s claim to be a child, the inidual will be referred to a local authority’s social services department for a careful, case law-compliant age assessment and they will be treated as a child until a decision on their age is made.“If an inidual is assessed to be over , we will process any asylum claim as being made by an adult. If the application is unsuccessful, and appeal rights are exhausted, removal action will be pursued as appropriate.“In the absence of documentary evidence, Home Office staff are only able to treat a claimant as an adulttheir physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggest that they are signicantly over  years of age – and where two officers have reached this conclusion independently.“The threshold is set deliberately high so that only those who are very clearly over  are assessed as adults.”The pupil was removed from the school earlier this month on the day he was due to sit a mock GCSE maths exam and has not been seen there since.The Ormiston Academies Trust confirmed at the time that the pupils were “not attending the school” and that it had asked the Home Office to investigate the case.The school has not made any new statement and Suffolk County Council has also not responded to requests for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may john hayes knighthood brexit deal","story":"Downing Street this afternoon announced John Hayes, a former Minister, would become Sir John in a rare honour.It comes with No. desperate to win back scores of Tories who have publicly vowed to block Theresa May’s Brexit agreement.A vote is due to take place in the week beginning December .Last week Sir John demanded the PM “look again” at elements of her deal and warned he couldn’t accept the terms of the so-called Irish backstop.Speaking earlier he insisted the gong had no bearing on how he will vote.He said: “I still need a lot of persuading to vote for this.”But furious Labour MPs called it a “spectacular act of desperation”.Others pointed out that Theresa May vowed to clean up the Honours system following the outrage over ex-PM David Cameron’s resignation honours in .Best for Britain champion Virendra Sharma said: “This is utter hypocrisy from a Prime Minister who pledged to end Cameron’s wheeler dealer ways on Honours.It seems like Downing Street will do anything to get their bad Brexit deal through.Earlier this week furious young Tory MPs claimed older Eurosceptics had refused to put in No Confidence letters against Theresa May because they were hoping for a peerage.First elected in , John Hayes serves South Holland in Lincolnshire, which delivered the nation’s second highest Leave vote in .He chairs the arch Eurosceptic ‘Cornerstone Group’ and called on Parliament earlier this month to consider theof the death penalty to curb violent"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451433379-e1543009840420.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit deal arlene foster scrap tory deal","story":"Foster, , told BBC Radio Ulsters Inside Politics: If she is successful in Parliament, and there is no evidence that she is going to be successful in Parliament, then of course we will have to revisit the confidence and supply agreement.That agreement was about giving national stability, it was acting in the national interest and delivering on Brexit.If this is not going to deliver on Brexit then of course that brings us back to the situation of looking at the confidence and supply agreement, but we are not there yet and we are not going to jump ahead until we see what happens in Parliament.The Democratic Unionist Party effectively became kingmakers after the  general election thanks to the confidence and supply deal that was struck with the Conservative party to keep May in power.It means the DUPs ten MPs will vote with the Tories on key measures such as the Budget and any votes of no confidence that could topple the government.Founded by Protestant firebrand Ian Paisley, the DUP was once a fringe party but is now the largest in Northern Ireland, with a narrow electoral edge over republicans Sinn Fein.Led by Arlene Foster, they are staunchly pro-union and pro-Brexit.May has already found herself in hot water over the DUP when they recently went on strike during voting on the recent Finance Bill earlier this week.Their refusal to back the Government on the all-important money legislation is a clear breach of the confidence and supply agreement that cost taxpayers £billion.But senior DUP sources last night told The Sun the party would continue to stay away from Commons votes until Mrs May agrees to rip up her controversial Irish backstop.A senior DUP figure told The Sun at the time:  “I don’t think we’ll see much Government legislation tabled next week, as they know what we’ll do now.“They are breaking the agreement, not us.

So, while she addressed the Commons as Work and Pensions Secretary for the first time, the Mirror gave some of her battling constituents the chance to speak up themselves. None was more damning than widow Georgina Mitchell, , who is struggling under the new benefits system. She said: “I’d like to see Amber Rudd on the breadline. It’s not nice. No one wants to be living like this.” Another constituent, Max Monroe, was searching for somewhere to sleep. Max, , has been homeless since February after he lost his job and was moved from the old benefits sysshyshyshytem to Universal Credit. One of dozens of rough sleepers on the streets of Hastings on the south coast, he is nershyshyvous of the die-hards bedding down in the filthy underpass.   So Max, from Hailsham, East Sussex, curls up in his sleeping bag in the catacombs beneath a decaying boarding house.Grim, but out of the rain. His story is a snapshot of austerity Britain. In Ms Rudd’s Hastings and Rye constituency, poverty and wealth are uncomfortable neighbours. And it is impossible to ignore the impact of Universal Credit, pushing the jobless on to the streets and forcing families to rely on food-banks. “When I was put on Universal Credit I couldn’t catch up with my rent,” Max tells me.“I had been working at Wickes and Wetherspoons before but after that there were no more jobs. “I had a flat which I had to pay pound a month. I was soon pound short every month.It escalated so I went on the streets. I’d say Universal Credit was to blame.”   Outside the local Jobcentre Plus, just up the hill from Max, I meet mum-of-one Carol Pentecost, , pushing her nine-month-old son Blake in a buggy. Carol is at least pound-a-month worse off since the roll-out of Universal Credit. “After I’ve paid the bills, there’s nothing left for food and nappies for Blake,” says Carol.“We have to get three bags of groceries from the food-bank. “Amber Rudd needs to stop Universal Credit. It’s making everything worse – a lot of the people we know are suicidal.”  A DWP spokesman said: “No one has to face hardship with Universal Credit and we recently announced a poundmillion partnership with Citizens Advice to help vulnerable people with claims.” However, homelessness is visible on almost every street in Hastings, where four rough sleepers died over the Christmas period at the start of this year. Chrissy Brand, of campaign group People’s Assembly Against Austerity in Hastings, said: “It’s bad enough for the local community having Amber Rudd as our out-of-touch and destructive MP. It’s positively dangerous for the country to have her as the Work and Pensions Secretary, months after she had to resign due to her part in the Windrush scandal which destroyed so many lives.  “She says Universal Credit has done great things for Hastings.Wrong, there has been an % rise in food-bank use here over the past year because of that.” Now it seems, Ms Rudd is oblivious to the national picture, after she dismissed a UN report into poverty in Britain. She said the language used in the damning investigation was “wholly inappropriate”. Its author Philip Alston shyaccused the Government of being in denial about Universal Credit.

Police say it would be impossible to defend against a terrorist with one of the . calibre or higher guns which can immobilise a vehicle or truck from a mile away. And the Government had the backing of the Labour Party to pass the ban through Parliament. But  MPs signed an amendment to reverse the ban, including members of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Groupof hard Brexit backbenchers.  The group said the ban was disproportionate, and laid out plans for a high-security process for people to obtain high-energy weapons. Yet they were also seeking the chance to prove they had the numbers in Parliament to block government legislation in the run up to the ‘meaningful vote’ on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.  Former Brexit minister Steve Baker, Sir Bill Cash and Sir Bernard Jenkin were among those supporting the amendment to the offensive weapons bill that would prevent a ban on rles that have a power of “over , joules at the muzzle.” It was also opposed by DUP MPs and Labour MP Kate Hoey.

She couldnt say her deal will be better than cancelling Brexit, and staying in the EU. She refused to deny shell resignher deal is blocked in the House of Commons. And thats all before you get to the questions about her personal le. With an EU summit looming this Sunday and battles raging in the Tory party, here are  moments that made us cringe. . When she refused to say her deal is better than cancelling Brexit  The Prime Minister struggled to answer when askedher deal was better than staying in the EU. Instead she admitted it will be dferent. Its a dferent sort of environment and a dferent approach we will be taking to things, she said. She was slapped down by caller Michael. He was askedthe PM had answered his question, and he replied bluntly: No. Eventually, pressed by the host, Theresa May insisted: We can build a better future outside the EU. But her failure to trump her own deal will put rocket boosters on MPs - Leave and Remain - who say it must be junked.  Theresa May refused to deny shell resignher Brexit deal is defeated in Parliament. The Prime Ministers deal is widely expected to be voted down in the House of Commons before Christmas. But confronted by host Emma Barnett, Mrs May failed three times to guarantee she will lead Britain out of the crisis. The comments open the door to Mrs May triggering a brutal Tory leadership contest in just a few weeks, with no Brexit deal in place. That would ramp up the chances of a general election, second EU referendum or chaotic No Deal Brexit.  A caller asked how the PM will celebrate with husband Philipthings DO go to plan - and the deal passes. She was at a total loss. We can only assume she hasnt actually thought of the prospect of victory. She insisted robotically that she was focused on getting the deal through before adding lamely: Well have a drink together. Theresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons. Even getting it past her Cabinet forced Esther McVey and Dominic Raab to resign. Now she faces two more hurdles - an EU summit with  leaders on November , and then the vote in Parliament at some point before Christmas. MPs are grouped in several factions - their warring opinions are explained more fully here. But or more vote against the deal, they will defeat the deal. Against the deal TORY BREXITEERS: There are up to  , led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. They will vote down a deal that keeps Britain trapped in vassalage with Brussels. TORY HARD REMAINERS: Only about a dozen, but many - including Justine Greening and Jo Johnson - will vote against, instead wanting a second referendum. DUP: Theresa Mays Northern Irish allies - who she handed pound.bn - are -strong. They will vote down the dealit allows customs checks between Ulster and Britain. LABOUR LOYALISTS: About  MPs are consistently loyal to Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit. The party has confirmed theyll be told to vote against the deal because it doesnt meet Labours six tests. LABOUR REMAINERS: There are about  hard Remainer Labour MPs. Theyre likely to oppose the deal to avoid enabling a Brexit.OTHERS: The SNP , Lib Dems , Plaid Cymruand Greensare all likely to vote against. For the deal TORY LOYALISTS: Well over  are likely to vote with Theresa May, for the deal. Many have paid government jobs - so would have to quitthey oppose her. NERVOUS LABOUR: Some Labour MPs could BACK a deal - fearing otherwise Britain will be plunged into an even worse No Deal. There could be  or more. Caroline Flint is among them. UnknownLABOUR BREXITEERS: There are only about half a dozen. It was generally thought theyd side with Theresa May, but Kate Hoey MP broke ranks and said she could vote against. Heather in Devon had the bluntest, most dficult question. Having ignored the public for over two years, she asked the Prime Minister, how can we trust you now  Mrs May replied: Well Heather, Im very sorry that you think we havent been listening to the public. Which is a classic of the Im sorry ... genre of apology. She added it was right, first and foremost, to listen to the vote the British people cast to leave on  June .  Labour want Mrs May to go back and renegotiate the deal with Brusselsit fails. And reports have suggested she wants tofor a second vote by MPs. But she stuck a rather lumpy spanner in those hopes. The PM said: I believewe were to go back to the European Union and say well people didnt like that deal, can we have another one I dont think theyre going to come to us and say well give you a better deal.  One inspired question from a caller was - what time do you go to bed  And do you dream of Brexit. The Prime Minister laughed: I certainly dont go to sleep dreaming of Brexit, I can tell you that. We assume that includes nightmares. She did however admit she often doesnt get to bed until midnight. In fact, she told a group of school children that - and was afraid theyd tell their parents: Mummy can I stay up til midnight because the Prime Minister does  The EU has agreed a two-part Brexit deal - and it has enraged Tories.

Pack up Theresa and inform the Sun.Pour away the inept and sweep the dead wood. This party now can never come to any good. If theres one thing Western democracy has proven, it is that no-one can be trusted with power for very long.A first administration achieves change the second stagnates and a third,it appears, eats itself from the feet up. The same is true of every party, in every nation, and there is none among us who would be immune to the madness of power were it delivered for a third time.It sends all politicians who have ever managed it into the sort of cocaine-inspired bender Elton John was once famous for - trying to outdo Freddie Mercury with their own sense of misplaced grandeur, while actually being destined for a le in which they look forward to the John Lewis Christmas ad. It happened to Thatcher, it happened to Blair, and now its happening to the entire Conservative Party at once. This time its not a prime ministers career doomed to failure -  years of British politics is circling the plughole, entirely unaware of its looming extinction.   Over Thatchers time in office she burned every friend she had, endeared herself to half the country by presiding over an economic boom, and flushed middle-class goodwill down the toilet with the poll tax. Tory MPs with an eye to their own survival queued up to kne her as their only escape, and combined with the fact shed destroyed the other half of the country along with unions and manufacturing her time was nigh. Blair started out as a nice-sweatered saviour and came to believe he was genuinely touched by God, able to heal wars, depose despots with his righteousness and had no need to plan for the future because he was going to be raptured as soon as hed fixed the Middle East. He even tried to go one better than Jesus by cutting a deal with his personal Judas, and the net result was the whole Labour Party got stuck in the psychodrama and forgot they were supposed to be working for the people.Now we are in our eighth year of the Tories being in control, and theyve gone completely round the bend in half the time it took the others. Lets be kind. Theyve managed a fourth administration on a technicality, been presented with the most complex political problem in British history, and had the backwash of the Great Recession to deal with. But a party operating in the realms of sanity would not have called the fourth election, would not have attempted to settle centuries of squabbling with Europe by flipping a coin, or claimed to be fixing the economy by letting bankers keep their hands on the interestingly-smashy bits.The fact they were going round the twist so early in their reign is the surest sign this is the end game all decisions since  have been touched by madness, with the inevitable result that the Tories now think they really CAN lick their elbow because theyve spent so long claiming to be the only party you can trust with dficult stuff. Every economic, housing, health, justice and education policy did more to reduce than to improve them. This is not a political point but a factual one - the Tories have managed not one single victory, no shining achievement, in almost a decade of control. But there is a near-infinite number of turds. They deported British citizens in the Windrush scandal. They watched  people die in a towering inferno and sent benefit fraudsters to jail quicker than those who caused the deaths. Under their rule , people are thought to have needlessly died. An unprecedented rise in mortality has been linked directly to their policies. The greatest British invention of all time, the National Health Service, is being thoughtlessly destroyed for lack of maintenance. More than a million people are living in destitution and while they crow about near-full employment, millions of those in work rely on charity to feed their families.The Tories, whatever you may think of them, have never been so definitively linked to death and misery. If they had their wits about them, the backbenchers should, about now, be trying to dig their party out of this homicidal mire. Instead theyre declaring every disaster is someone s fault.  Having secured the countrys backing for Brexit, they spent two years arguing with themselves to the detriment of the British economy. Having secured the agreement of the EU on how to Brexit, they want to go back to negotiating it. And despite being called the Conservative and Unionist Party they seem prepared to throw Northern Ireland on the bonfire to appease their most eccentric members.They spent the first year of negotiations demanding Theresa May call an election to secure her mandate, and after she did so spent the second year demanding her head. The million letters of no confidence they cheerfully predicted turned into  they expected by pm, then definitely , then somewhere nearer . They dont even have confidence in their lack of confidence, and their only chance of passing a motion is with internal application of WD-. And while repeatedly calling themselves the party of law and order they let off their own sex pest because he says he was ill, when all sex pests in whatever courts remain open are sent down without mercy.Theyre now a minority government pretending theyre not, killing citizens while claiming to be acting in the national interest, and the only reason this rabid party hasnt been put out of its self-destructive misery is because the Opposition is too busy shooting itself in the foot.

So why doesn’t the king of UKIP get his modern-day Tommy Cromwell to share his expertise on other subjects like assault, drugs, public order offences, mortgage fraud and using someone ’s passport to travel to the USA, all of which he has convictions for  Also, Gerard, can you be more specic about his advisory remit  It’s Asian rapists only, isn’t it Because Robinson has never condemned the string of white paedophiles with links to the EDL, such as Peter Gillett, jailed last month for  years for raping children as young as eight. And can you ensure the remit doesn’t involve caring about the child rape victims BecauseRobinson did care about them, why has he constantly attempted to do the one thing that could have stopped them getting justice: risked causing the trials of their accused to crash due to his behaviour  Oh, and while you’re at it, why not bring Katie Hopkins in to advise on how to sink the boats of the refugee cockroaches heading from Africa to Europe    It’s not hard to see what Batten, who has openly called Islam a “death cult”, is up to.Swelling his diminished party ranks by targeting lies and bigotry at white working-class people who feel dispossessed by immigration, while wrapping it up in conspiracy theories about liberal elites.And riding the wave of far-right fervour that pollutes the global shypolitical narrative through hate preachers like Marine Le Pen, Donald Trump and Nigel Farage. The one funny aspect of this disturbing story is Farage being “appalled” at his “non-racist” party hiring Robinson.That’s the same Farage who spoke at a neo-Nazi AfD rally in Germany and who unveiled his blatantly racist “breaking point” poster showing crowds of queuing migrants during the EU referendum. Maybe he’s jealous there’s a younger kid on the block getting all the fascist love. But that’s where the humour stops. Because there’s nothing funny about giving a mainstream voice to a neo-Nazi.That leads to another voice yelling “Britain First” as an MP like Jo Cox is murdered in broad daylight. Or the number of far-right terrorists jailed in Britain more than tripling in the past year.Or to a rally in support of Robinson drawing the largest fascist gathering Britain had seen since Oswald Mosley’s Blackshirts. And don’t for a minute think we’ll neverto those dark days of the s because, as the Germans found out, when you start with a grievance against an Establishment which you believe has stolen your birthright, when you scapegoat a religion, talk up your own race as being superior, have a largely non-challenging media, expound a belief that breaking the law to protect the defence of the motherland is fine, and a jailed martyr, you can soon find your country in a very dark place.

Turning from the window, he laughs that his cravat is similar to the one he was wearing then, too. “My mother was making sure I was smart. I arrived here in one,” he smiles. “I’ve always preferred them.” But the clear dference between  and  is then -year-old Leslie was attempting bravely to look forwards today, aged , he is bravely looking back. With -year-old grandson Oscar by his side, he sits on the Harwich to London Liverpool Street train retracing his steps as one of  Jewish children to arrive on the first Kindertransport.   December  will mark eight decades since that groundbreaking rescue mission as the persecution faced by Jews in Nazi Germany intensied. They were waved off in Berlin, taken by train to the Hook of Holland, and then sailed across the Channel to arrive in Harwich, Essex the following day. Weeks later, young Leslie shytravelled this route to London before being transferred to a boarding school in Kent. Some , more children would follow until the outbreak of war in September . Recalling that first morning, Leslie says: “We landed after a very stormy night, everyone except me was sick. “We were all unslept, unkempt, unwashed and bewildered. We were in the same clothes, I had only eaten the shysandwiches my mother gave me.  Holocaust survivor tells of brave Polish family who risked their lives to protect him“I brought underclothes, carefully labelled with my name which my mother had stitched, a couple of extra shirts and an extra sweater, handkerchiefs, a book or two, and a tiny little teddy bear.” But the most treasured items were passport photographs of his mother and father, Charlotte and Arthur Baruch, and beloved sister Eva Susanne, who was two years older. Is there anything  he wishes he had been able to bring  “My sister,” Leslie replies, his voice almost lost in a train announcement. Leslie heard Eva chose not to come because she had fallen in love with a doctor at the hospital where she was a trainee nurse. Later, the -year-old wrote she had received a suitcase as a gt, a hint she may have changed her mind. It was too late. She and their parents were transported to their deaths in . “She was a headstrong young woman,” says Leslie. “We quarrelled of course, but we loved each other... I’ve had a huge dose of luck in my le.  But then there was my family’s fate...” That luck began with his parents’ selflessness. When Nazi shypersecution in his shyhometown of Koumlslin, then in Germany but now Poland, drove him from school, they sent him to an orphanage in Berlin to protect him. It did so more than they could have known. After Kristallnacht in early November , when the Nazis ransacked Jewish property and shysynagogues, he was one of seven from the orphanage selected by the director for the Kindertransport. “I don’t know on what basis I was chosen,” Leslie shrugs. “He was taken to Auschwitz and died. Most of the boys that remained were sent there, too. The real heroes of the Kindertransport were the parents. They gave away their children without knowing where they would finish up.” On December  his stood at the station. “I can see them still. They tried to maintain a stf upper lip and not cry,” he says.  “They waved shyhandkerchiefs. I didn’t cry. To an extent it was an adventure, not realising we’d never see our parents again.” Oscar admits shyly: “I think I’d cry. To leave your parents. If grandpa had not come over, I wouldn’t be here. It is amazing.” Leslie recalls the complete hush on the train. The Nazi police were hostile in some carriages children were abused. “We were told we had to be on our very best behaviour in case the German authorities threw us off or turned the train back,” he says. On reaching Holland that changed. Astonishingly, a photograph captures Leslie in that moment, standing in the carriage within a group, anxiety darkening his face. “I was thinking where am I going, what’s happening to me, what does the future hold ” he recalls. The atmosphere in Harwich as the children stepped off the boat to a throng of press was welcoming. “The policemen smiled at us,” he says. They were taken to the holiday camp Dover Court. Some were selected by couples, but he was chosen for Bunce Court boarding school in Kent. He flourished there, while missing his family, who sent treasured Red Cross telegrams. The last came in September  from his father.  Leslie describes the “extremely wild handwriting.” It reads, simply: “We are going on a journey.” “I know now he had already been told to go to an assembly point two days later. At the time I didn’t know what it meant,” he adds. Leslie joined the British army in , changing his name to Brent, hoping he would be helping his family. Tragically, they were already dead. He assumed they died in Auschwitz. In , shytravelling in Poland on a lecture tour as a scientist specialising in immunology, he visited the former camp, and broke down for the first time. It was to be a few more decades before official records revealed they were taken to Riga, Latvia, and shot in woodland. After making contact with a friend who survived, Leslie adds: “I discovered when my parents were deported Eva needn’t have gone. She was working in a hospital serving both Jews and non-Jews so she might have been protected.  But she didn’t want to leave them.” It’s important to Leslie people know about his headstrong sister and his brave parents. He couldn’t do anything for them  years ago but he can do this. He sits close to the grandson who would not be here today without the Kindertransport, and smiles. “When I die there will be no one left who knew them. But it keeps them alive when they are in people’s memories.”For more information visit ajr.org.uk.

A poll of , adults found the cold and dark winter months result in an increase in illnesses, a lower mood and an overall lack of motivation. But millions also see their sex le suffer with almost one in twenty saying their libido nosees during the winter. Others also have less energy, struggle to wake up, have sore and achy joints and muscles and are more likely to consume unhealthy or sugary foods than in the summer months. Dr Meg Arroll, a psychologist on behalf of wellbeing brand Healthspan, which commissioned the research said: “This shows that many of us do feel down in the dumps when the weather turns colder and days get shorter. Some of this may be due to the lack of daylight and perceived unpleasantness of being out and about in the wind and rain.  And of course, there are more coughs and colds during winter months which affect both how we feel physically and our mood. But the heartening aspect of this survey is that over a quarter of respondents state they take active steps to protect their health and wellbeing in winter. This is the key to good health as we may not be able to control the weather, but we can control how we think and feel and take action to improve our overall outlook.” The study also found  per cent of Brits think winter is bad for their health and it really impacts on their appearance. Forty-one per cent stated they are more affected by colds and flu during the winter months, while  per cent believe they suffer more from dry skin. Three in  have less energy and feel more tired while  per cent believe they are more likely to gain weight than they are in the summer. Almost six in  say their mood is generally lower in winter than at any other time of the year, with  per cent blaming the dark morning and evenings.  Another  per cent put their bad mood down to the cold weather while  per cent say it’s because they always feel ill. It also emerged the nation’s health takes a hit in the winter with half saying they are more likely to be ill during the season than any other time of year with around two colds and two days off work from September to February. To add to this,  per cent of Brits feel more motivated to exercise in the summer months, spending an average of four hours and  minutes in the gym. This drops to  hours and  minutes in the winter. Researchers from OnePoll also found  per cent see their diet change as they mover into the winter months. Almost two thirds turn to comfort food as the temperature drops, while  per cent eat less salad and  per cent consume more sugary treats. Others eat more fast food, less fruit and vegetables and drink less water. But  per cent do take extra steps to safeguard their health and appearance during the winter months.  Half of those polled  per cent take health supplements and use extra moisturiser to combat dry skin,  per cent go to bed earlier and  per cent try to improve their diet. Dr Sarah Brewer, Healthspan Medical Director said: Diet should always come first, so focus on obtaining at least five-a-day fruit and veg for immune boosting vitamin C, plus two servings of oily fish per week for omega- and vitamin D. Clinical trials show that sucking zinc acetate lozenges signicantly reduces symptoms of the common cold compared with placebo. Zinc acetate lozenges shortened the duration of nasal congestion by  per cent, scratchy throat by  per cent, hoarseness by  per cent and cough by  per cent. Sucking zinc acetate lozenges also shortened the duration of muscle aching by  per cent. Taking Zinc and Vitamin C tablets to prevent colds is also a popular strategy during winter months.

Today a whopping pound.bn was splashed out, kickstarting an pound.bn four day pre-Christmas shopping spree. But as bargain hunters flock online to find the best deals, experts told shoppers they must take extra precautions to beef-up their online security to protect themselves from being a victim of the crimes. And they warned failing to do so - through a combination of internet scams, weak passwords and mistaking fake websites as genuine - could see online shoppers targeted to the tune of poundm, particularly those shopping online on Monday. Simon McCulloch, director at comparethemarket, warned: “As more and more people choose to shop online, our money is made increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated cyber criminals. “Six million Brits are at risk of fraud over the four day shopping period - with cyber Monday being a peak time for hackers.   “Banks and retailers must do their best to protect customers from fraud, not least because data compromises can lead to customers voting with their feet and switching accounts. The warnings come after mobile phones took a key role in Black Friday as shoppers snapped up deals from their bedrooms, at the bus stop and on the train – rather than heading to the high street. Argos said half of its orders so far had been made on a handset, up from % last year, while Currys PC World said % of their online purchases were made via mobile devices. Debenhams and Game Digital’s websites crashed on Thursday evening, while Carphone Warehouse said it received  orders per minute on its site, with the Samsung Galaxy S and Apple iPhone XR being the most popular items.   And HSBC became the latest high street bank to report IT issues after customers were locked out of their online accounts on the busiest shopping day of the year. A quarter of Brits in the last year have been a victim of online fraud - losing a staggering pound.bn, figures from online security firm Sophos found. Many were tricked through bogus emails and websites but most commonly from failing to take basic precautions to protect themselves. GCHQ’s National Cyber Security Centre technical director, Ian Levy, advised: “Checkyour account has been compromised in a data breach at haveibeenpwned before you go shopping. “If you haven’t changed your password since one of those data breaches and you were involved, go change it before you do stuff.” Head of public engagement Kate Sinnott, from GCHQ, added: “It’s really important not to have a password that can in any way be associated with you, be it your partner’s name, your child’s name, your street address. Anything like that can be guessed by criminals. Make it random.”   She also advised against making an account with retailers soa data breach takes place your information is stored on their site as well having a separate “super-protected” password for your email account. If you think you have fallen victim she advised shoppers to contact their bank as well as “take a note of what the website is, immediately close down your internet browser and report those details to Action Fraud. “ Kate added: “Unfortunately loads of people are falling victim to fraud, so it’s not you. “But,there’s something that’s making you feel uncomfortable or a little bit suspicious about the transaction, such as asking you for an excessive amount of information, take action quickly.” A new Black Friday scam emerged last year, which included more than , malicious Black Friday-themed apps spoofing the branding of global online retailers. The apps tricked shoppers into entering credit card information or Facebook and Gmail login details. Simon McCulloch, director at comparethemarket, also advised customers to make payments over pound with a credit card which protects transactions “under Section  of the Consumer Credit Act, soyou are victim of fraud you should be able to get your money back.” "},{"url":null,"title":"7 signs black friday must","story":" signs Black Friday must be banned in America because they cant be trusted with itYes, we all love to watch the carnage unfold but some people take it too far.

It’s a tragedy that tenants are being exploited in this way, forced to live in Dickensian conditions by unscrupulous landlords like Mrs Nadeem.   This case is a warning to other property owners who think they can ignore the law – anyone who builds properties in our borough without planning permission can expect a knock on the door from our enforcement officers.” “Paying council tax is not the same as having planning permission and failure to comply with planning notices is a criminal offence.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are reportedly leaving west London and moving into the -bedroom home, near Windsor Castle, to raise a family in a quieter setting amid alleged tension with Prince William. The Queen is giving them their own pad on a Windsor estate - Frogmore House - thats been a favourite royal hideaway for more than  years. The Grade II-listed cottage is said to be undergoing a multi-million pound refit, paid for by the taxpayer, before pregnant Meghan gives birth to the couples first child.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, whose due date is in the spring, will move into their main official residence next year once the refit is complete, according to reports. It is claimed that they had planned to move into one of Kensington Palaces main apartments, next to William and Kate, but there has been a bit of tension between the brothers. It is likely that it will get a full security upgrade to keep prying eyes away. Previously, the public could walk right up to the property, which was surrounded by a small fence with a sign reading Private.  The couple currently live in their first marital home, a cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace in west London, where Prince William and Kate Middleton also reside. Frogmore Cottage has more than enough space for the Sussex family and a nursery for their baby - and even a gym or a yoga studio - with  bedrooms. Formerly known as Double Garden Cottage, the home is set within Windsor Castles Home Park and faces the stunning and sprawling grounds of Frogmore House, which will no doubt become a more popular stop on the Windsor tourist trail.   The cottage is currently ided into five units which were home to royal staff, but it will be transformed into a family home with modern amenities. Frogmore Cottage is set in an area that has sentimental value and many memories for the Duke, , and Duchess, , Its not far from Windsor Castle, the Queens summer residence, and St Georges Chapel, where Harry and Meghan tied the knot in May as millions around the world watched on TV.   Their wedding reception, hosted by the Prince of Wales, was held at Frogmore House, which was also where the couples engagement photos were taken. Frogmore House is in a peaceful and secluded location, surrounded by  acres of lush vegetation and Berkshire countryside. The estate has its own lake, Frogmore Lake, and is home to the Royal Burial Ground and the tomb of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.   Frogmore House was once home to Queen Victorias mother, the Duchess of Kent. Her remains are also held there, in an elegant mausoleum. The House - built in the s and purchased by Queen Charlotte, we of George III in  - is open to the public just one month a year, in August, plus three charity open days. The sprawling grounds allowed Queen Charlotte to indulge her love of botany, as the garden was filled with many rare and unusual plants. Tickets cost up to pound a person through the Royal Collection Trust.  Public access is extremely limited because Frogmore House is still used by the Queen and other members of the Royal Family as a private retreat. Frogmore House was built by Hugh May, Charles IIs architect, and given a name that refers to the abundance of frogs in the surrounding marsh. It became a royal residence about  years later and has become a hideaway for royal couples and families, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and their children. Victoria was fond of Frogmores peace and quiet, and it is said to have been her favourite retreat. Frogmore Cottage was once home to Abdul Karim, her Munshi, or teacher.  George VI and the Queen Mother honeymooned in the grounds in . Harry and former Suits actress Meghan are currently residing at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace. It is claimed that the couple opted for secluded Frogmore Cottage over a flat next door to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The Sun quoted an unnamed royal source, who said: The initial plan was for Harry and Meghan to move out of their cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace and into one of the main apartments. But there has been a bit of tension between the brothers.Now Harry and Meghan don’t want to live next to William and Kate and want to strike out on their own. The couple need more room and hope the Frogmore Cottage renovation will be complete before they welcome their baby, the source claimed. The Duke and US-born Duchess of Sussex will keep their country home in the Cotswolds while they reside in Windsor.

Kate Middleton reportedly had to make a big compromise for her wedding in  after a royal request clashed with what she wanted. In the documentary William and Kate: The Journey, journalist Ashley Pearson describes what is said to have happened.  She said: “Royal sources tell me that the Royals indicated very strongly to Kate that they would prefer her to wear her hair up for this very special occasion. “However, Kate had her heart set on wearing her hair down with long flowing curls, which is her favourite way to wear it, and actually Williams favourite as well. In the end, Kate apparently went for a compromise and wore her hair half-up and half-down with curls. It wasnt the biggest tradition the Duchess of Cambridge broke when she tied the know with Prince William on April , . She was also the first commoner to marry into the immediate family in  years.  Author Jessica Jayne described in her book The Duchess of Cambridge: How Kate Middleton Became A Future Queen how: “All of those who have lambasted Kate and criticised her for being common ate their words. “Back in the old days, a commoner marrying into royalty may just be a dream but times have changed, Kate would be the first commoner to marry a prince in  years.” US actress Meghan Markle became the second commoner to marry into the Windsors when she tied the knot with Prince Harry in May this year, becoming the Duchess of Sussex.She did wear her hair up so might not have been so bothered about the tradition and wanted to please the royals.

My step-dad got straight on the phone to MS.  “I was more afraid that I had eaten the other half [of the sandwich] before I relalised. Mrs Kellow has complained to MS customer service team and said the company assured her that it is investigating the issue and has made contact with its sandwich supplier. She added: “I think it must have been put there by a disgruntled employee. It almost looked like it had been placed there deliberately. “I don’t see how it would have got through all the quality checks. That’s also what the woman told me on the phone.” She is urging other people to check their food, particularly when feeding children. She added: “I just think people should be aware.  “I’m not somebody that would shout from the rooftops about this kind of thing but I think people should know. “If it is a disgruntled employee they could have done this to hundreds of sandwiches. “I have four children and I would have given the eldest three a sandwich without even thinking about it. “It makes you realise you have to be careful even with processed foods. “I would have been absolutely lividI had eaten it. I just think people should know because at the need of the day, something has slipped through the net.” An MS spokesperson said: ‘We’re sorry to hear about Ms Kellow’s compliant.We take complaints of this nature seriously and have asked the customer tothe sandwich to us as soon as possible so we can investigate further’."},{"url":null,"title":"new 20 minute flu test","story":"NewsNew -minute flu test will free up thousands of beds and save NHS £millionEvery winter, flu sufferers take up scarce NHS resources - but a new -minute test could change thatShareCommentsByMartin BagotHealth and Science Correspondent:,  NOV NewsThe flu sweeps the country every winter \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new flu test which can diagnose patients in just  minutes has been shown to cut NHS bed blocking by %.

Fashion and antiques auctioneer Kerry Taylor said that the rag-doll belonged to Her Majesty when she was a princess rather than a Queen back in the s. She would have been around nine or  years old probably when she got this doll, she said.   The toy is a Chad Valley doll and has glass eyes, a swivel head, a velvet body and jointed limbs. Kerry reckons it was well loved by young Elizabeth. You can see the little nose has been rubbed. It’s been heavily played with, she said. Kerry has estimated its value as pound-pound,, but said it would not surprise herthe doll went for more.   Its very rare that anything belonging to Her Majesty ever comes on the market, she added. As far as the auctioneer is aware, this is the first time a royal doll has come to market.

Its not the only royal item thats set to be up for grabs.   Three floral dresses and other items worn by Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret will be available to bid on.

Forecasters are predicting weeks of on-and-off snowfall between now and Christmas, with temperatures plummeting well below freezing. They say a battleground scenario will play out over the coming weeks, with snow and less wintery fronts constantly clashing over the UK. Earlier this week, the first snowfall of this winter left parts of the UK blanketed in snow. Drivers in Derbyshire and Yorkshire took to social media to share images of perilous conditions on the roads - something many of us may experience as we get closer to Christmas.  Winter travel - how to make sure you arent left out of pocket here or abroad As polar gales from Siberia sweep across the country, the feels-like temperature could plummet to a bone-chilling -. Eleanor Bell, principal meteorologist for the Weather Company, told The Sun: We expect this winter to be dferent to the last seven milder winters we have had, with an increased risk for colder intrusions across the northern half of Europe and below normal temperatures through January and February. We do think that next week’s ‘battleground’ scenario could recur several times in the weeks ahead, giving the potential for further snowfalls in the run-up to Christmas. Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell said: It will stay cold for the rest of this week.  It will be feeling cold as we head towards the weekend and south west England could be at risk of some heavy rain and thunder. For Sunday, we lose the risk of thundery showers in the south west and where will be cloudy with showers. While the outlook is certainly looking pretty chilly, the south west is set for a drenching this weekend, with forecaster predicting up to  inches of rain in just  hours. Bands of heavy rain will be thundery at times, and some showers may contain small hail, the Met Office says.  Millions of Brits are at risk of power cuts, damage to homes and travel chaos during the harsh weather. The Met Office yellow warning for rain said: Bands of heavy, at times thundery, showers are expected to affect parts of southwest England from Friday morning until later on Saturday. Whilst most areas will see a rather wet spell, not everywhere will see the heaviest downpours. Where they do occur, - mm may fall in - hours, with perhaps around  mm falling in  hours - most likely across southeast-facing coasts and moors of Devon and Cornwall. Showers may also contain small hail at times.

Natalie Martins, from Surrey, gives the poignant voiceover as a man listens to a tape of his mothers final loving Christmas message after opening a box of old casettes. The budget festive film, named Love is a Gt, racked up more than six million views on Facebook this week after filmmaker Phil Beastall posted it in response to John Lewiss poundmillion big budget production starring Elton John. Ms Martins is an award-winning actress and has featured in seven feature films,  short films as well as TV shows and adverts. She took home the Best Actress award for Miracle Grow at the London Independent Film Festival . After the film went viral, Natalie Martins posted: Oh my word! Love is a Gt has now hit the million view mark. All the feels around the nation! Thanks to everyone who is sharing out short film.   A special film with a special message. Congratulations Phil Beastall on this achievement - this didnt happen by chance or sheer luck - this happened because you are a talented filmmaker and a wonderful storyteller. Good work deserves to be seen - you deserve this. And she added last night: Our no budget film seems to be receiving all the love and stealing some thunder! Fans of the tear-jerker are calling for John Lewisto hire the budget filmmaker for their next festive advert.  Mr Beastall wrote: Off the back of the John Lewis Christmas advert I wanted to share my very own Christmas film which I made back in . Its a short film about a man counting down the days to Christmas so he can continue his yearly tradition sparked by a tragic moment from the past. One Facebook user said: It will be my th Christmas without my mum x it’s always gut wrenching every year... Its a sad lonely time for a lot of people. Phil, from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, said: A lot of people are saying how it has touched them and made them feel that they can cope a little bit more this Christmas, which is amazing. I never expected that at all. To think people are getting so much from my film. I am blown away.  Phil said: People seem to like my film because its the story that shines through. You don’t always need a huge budget, just an impactful narrative that gets the message across. I think theres a bit of a revolution going on in the advertising industry. People no longer want to be overtly sold something which makes our job as video producers a lot harder because we have to sell indirectly. Phil said that although he enjoyed John Lewis advert, he thinks spending so much on an advert when people struggle financially isnt sitting well with people. ButJohn Lewis knocked on my door tomorrow and said would you want to make next year’s film I would obviously snap it up in an instant.

I’ve been very pleased with what we’ve seen from him so far.”Curran’s role has changed under the new manager after previous boss Neil McCann wanted to develop him into an attacking full-back.McIntyre, though, sees him further up the pitch where he can use his pace to hurt opposing teams more directly.Also able to play as a central midfielder, Curran’s versatility has its uses for a manager but Jim has urged the young Aussie to “nail down a position” to really fulfil the potential he sees in him.The Dens boss said: “I see him playing further forward rather than right-back, though I know he can play there.

It was aspirational and we knew that we wouldn’t get everything asked for.”However, the value of the deal – less than half of what was aspired to – has left some disappointed.West End Labour councillor Richard McCready said: “I will be seeking an explanation of the downgrading of expectations of what can be achieved through the deal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"rbs-paid-contractors-400-a-day-to-stuff-envelopes","story":"Royal Bank of Scotland paid contractors a staggering pound a day to stuff envelopes, wasting thousands of pounds of taxpayersrsquo money in the process, it can be revealed."},{"url":null,"title":"youre-dragging-us-into-the-gutter-celtic-chairman-ian-bankier-blasts-section-of-parkhead-support","story":"Celtic chairman Ian Bankier has told a section of the Parkhead support that they are ldquodragging the club into the gutter with their persistence in singing inappropriate songs."},{"url":null,"title":"style-mile-carnival-leaves-st-enoch-centre-on-sunday-for-festive-fun","story":"IT is one of the citys most popular festive events... and this year the city centre will be transformed into a fairy tale."},{"url":null,"title":"michael-buble-tickets-to-go-on-sale-today","story":"EVERYONES favourite Christmas crooner Michael Buble will release tickets for his Scottish tour date today."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-new-celtic-christmas-advert-featuring-pc-mikael-lustig","story":"Celtic have once again embraced the holiday season with another hilarious Christmas video."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-manager-brendan-rodgers-wont-ring-the-changes-for-the-sake-of-it","story":"Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers will avoid making too many changes to the Parkhead squad as they prepare for a gruelling run of games between now and the New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-defender-marvin-compper-wants-january-exit","story":"Celtic defender Marvin Compper will look to engineer an exit from the Parkhead club in January but maintains that he will look to resurrect his career where."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-cup-medal-worn-by-celtic-legend-sells-for-thousands","story":"A SCOTTISH Cup medal won by legendary Celtic centre half, Willie Cringan, almost  years ago has sold for pound, at auction in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-raffling-off-3m-mansion-for-just-25-a-ticket","story":"AN English couple have decided to raffle off their pound million house via an online contest."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118520.jpg","title":"Festive fundraiser helping mum get through baby loss","story":"A MUM whose baby son died unexpectedly six months ago is throwing herself into fundraising activity to help her cope with her loss.Stevie Dixon of Sicily Road, Inverness woke up on May  to find -week-old Harry had died during the night.Speaking about it publicly for the first time, the horror of that morning remains vivid for the -year-old home carer who is bravely trying to move on with her le with her husband Liamand their other two sons Charlieand Zak .ldquoWe woke up and he was gone, she said, adding that she was in such a state her husband had to call the ambulance before carrying out CPR.ldquoWe did everything we could till the ambulance arrived, but we knew he was gone.ldquoHe was just starting to get his own personality and was a happy wee boy and in good health.

at Fir Park in the quarter-finals of the League Cup and then lost by the same scoreline in the Scottish Cup semi at Hampden. In both games the Reds were out- muscled by Well.But Ball is confident Aberdeen will more than hold their own in the physical battles and insists there will be no holding back for fear of sustaining an injury that could kill any cup final dream.He said: “Everyone who is playing has to go out there and give everything they have – like we do in every game. It is always a tough, physical game against Motherwell. However, we have shown we can win games in all sorts of dferent styles of play.“The coaches will prepare us in the best way they think we can win and we will go out and execute that at Motherwell.“We need to carry on our form as we have a strong squad and we are starting to get momentum with our play.”Aberdeen travel to Fir Park on the back of a four-game winning streak that secured a cup final slot and ato the top six.Prior to that upsurge in form, the Dons sat eighth in the table. But Ball reckons there were mitigating factors for that lowly position.He said: “It was a mixture of a load of things as we had injuries, suspensions and new players had come into the club.“It takes a bit of time but we have finally worked out each other and are now starting to show that.”Having starred for the Dons last season, Ball ed for a second loan spell in the summer which is for the entire campaign.Rotherham have the option to recall the -year-old in January should they require.Ball has made  starts this season and featured four times off the bench.Although happy with his form, he insists there remains room for improvement.He said: “I have been very good this season. However, the last month was maybe not my best month. However, that is football.“You have a really good run of form and sometimes you drop.“For me it is just about picking it back up and pushing on this month.”Today’s clash with Motherwell begins a congested fixture list where the Dons will pack in  games before the end of the year.It is a pivotal period that could ultimately yield a trophy and will also have major influence on the Premiership bid.He said: “We have  games coming up between now and the winter break and we need to get as many points as we can.“Everyone in the squad is going to play a part in that time.”"},{"url":null,"title":"deals there if you want it gary boss","story":"Aberdeen have opened up contract talks with winger Gary Mackay-Steven and are set to offer the Scotland cap a new deal.Dons boss Derek McInnes today confirmed preliminary discussions have started with the -year-old who is out of contract at the end of the season.Mackay-Steven’s value to the club long term was underlined and it was intimated a deal would be there should he also see his future at Pittodrie.With his deal set to expire next summer GMS will be free to speak to any interested clubs from the start of the winter transfer window on January .Mackay-Steven is the Dons’ leading scorer this season with six goals.

it’s got through the European research funds.“We live in a global world, you can’t just close the door and say ‘we’re closed’.“It doesn’t work like that.”During his address to the graduates, Lord Darling spoke of the “isive” nature of the current political climate.Lord Darling said that the Conservative Party has a particular ide over Europe.He said: “There is something about Europe that does something to the Conservative Party, it was like that the whole time that I was there, it does something to people.“Butyou look at the younger generation, they don’t think it’s a particularly big deal.“Just look at the ersity on show here during this graduation, it reflects the global world in which we live.”Lord Darling also said that he can’t see who would take over from Prime Minister Theresa May should she be the subject of a vote of no confidence.He said: “Realistically, I can’t imagine who would take over the Tories right now, because the same fate would await them.”Speaking after the ceremony, the member of the House of Lords had some advice for graduating students.He said: “Do what you feel good about.“A good education will enable you to do most things, but you’ll be constantly changing and learning new things, because most people do several things in their lives.“A degree doesn’t usually see people through to the time where they’re picking up their gold

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"bustling prestwick town praised national","story":"NewsBustling Prestwick town praised on national stageThe town landed second place in Scotland at the Great British High Street Awards last week.ShareByPippa Smith:,  NOV NewsSuccess Prestwick is boom town \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBustling business in Prestwick has been praised on the national stage.

He added: “The Business Association is proud of Prestwick and proud of what it’s done for the town and what the town has achieved over the last  years.  “We felt, along with Friends of Broadway, that we are a Main Street without empty shops and the vibrancy of the town both during the day and at night when it comes alive. “The town has strong community links and community groups who all work towards a positive Prestwick – in short, our town has a community and a business relationship unlike many towns. “Our local councillors gave up their time to spend with the Great British High Street Judges on the day of reckoning, our shops decked out in bunting, and our community played a huge part by voting using hashtag #GBHSPRESTWICK. “Prestwick has evolved over the last  years into a High Street which meets the needs of the local community and this is rewarded by its great community support and its ability to attract visitors. “With many towns suffering decline Prestwick is staying ahead of many but recognises it needs to keep growing. “The town is looking to some great initiatives for , it has so much to offer and it can only move forward. “Who knows maybe next year it will be top spot.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"popular prestwick nightspot elliots set","story":"NewsPopular Prestwick nightspot Elliots set to open delicatessenOwners Buzzworks have received planning permission to carry out a makeover of the premises.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsPopular Elliots in Prestwick \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Night spot Elliots is to open a delicatessen on Prestwick Main Street.Owners Buzzworks have received planning permission to carry out a makeover of the premises.The outside terrace will get a new look with a retractable canopy and the ladies’ toilets will be made biggerA new extension at the side of the building will house the deli business, the South Ayrshire Council Regulatory Panel heard.Buzzworks chairman, Colin Blair pointed out how the building was now -years-old and the firm wanted to address current issues with it.

One thing I am absolutely certain about is this: a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for Scotland and the whole of the UK.It would harm the economy, threaten jobs and damage peoplersquos standards of living. I will do everything I can to stop that happening.Irsquove been disappointed by the soap opera of cabinet resignations over the past few days and Irsquom dismayed that colleagues might yet try to force a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.That would be a huge distraction at the worst possible moment.It is time for MPs on all sides to recognise that the alternative to the deal we have negotiated is leaving the EU without a deal. I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights. However, to support their own political objectives, they currently plan to vote against the proposed agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has shown resolve, determination and strength of character as we move towards the final, dficult stages of the Brexit process.

to campaign for a new high school in Hawick - ahead of both Galashiels and Selkirk.Westminster MP John Lamont and Holyrood MSP Rachael Hamilton have launched the campaign, which aims to bring about a new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came on the back of assessments of the four schools that found they all have what are described as major defects.The facilities at each school were graded from A to D, with A signying that the buildings are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"foster-eu-withdrawal-text-not-in-nis-long-term-interests","story":"The draft EU withdrawal agreement contains arrangements that are not in Northern Irelandrsquos long-term interests, Arlene Foster will tell her party conference later.The country would inevitably begin to erge from its largest market, the rest of the UK,it remained part of the EUrsquos customs code under the backstop arrangement, the DUP leader will declare before massed crowds of supporters in Belfast.The backstop is a fallback designed to avoid a hard Irish border which would see Northern Ireland continue to follow some EU rules around tradeno better solution can be found.Mrs Foster is expected to say: ldquoWe cannot wish away the fact that the draft withdrawal agreement contains arrangements that are not in Northern Irelandrsquos long-term economic or strategic interests.ldquoNorthern Ireland would remain part of the European Unionrsquos customs code and as things stand we would be sowing the seeds of inevitable economic ergence from our largest market.Tory Brexiteer Boris Johnson is also expected to address the DUP conference on Saturday.Mrs Foster acknowledged the frustration of many in Northern Irelandrsquos business community with the pace of negotiations.Her party has prided itself on its relationship with firms, but relations have been strained by their support for the draft UK-EU deal.Mrs Foster has said the DUP may revisit its deal to support the Conservatives in key votes at Westminster.She will tell her annual conference: ldquoI acknowledge the hard work and determined efforts of the Prime Minister to secure an agreement.ldquoShe is genuine when she says she wants to see an outcome that does no harm to the Union and the internal market of the United Kingdom.ldquoHowever, this draft agreement fails her own key commitments.ldquoThe Prime Minister has not been able to guarantee an outcome that eliminates the risk of the introduction of the so-called backstop arrangements.Mrs Foster is expected to urge negotiators to seek a better outcome.The position of Gibraltar had been one of the issues facing EU states attempting to agree a common position on UK withdrawal.Spain is pressing for a guarantee over its say on the future of Gibraltar.A delegation from the British overseas territory on the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula travelled to take part in the DUP conference.The DUP leader is expected to pledge: ldquoWe stand with the people and the government of Gibraltar at this time.Nigel Dodds, the DUPrsquos leader at Westminster, is expected to tell the conference that without his partyrsquos support the Government would have been defeated in almost half of all votes on the EU Withdrawal Act.ldquoThe Governmentrsquos commitments under it are clearhellip including on Brexit.

referendums","story":"A people’s vote on holding a referendum on the Brexit deal would set a precedent in the eventuality of a vote for Scottish independence.The circumstances are completely dferent.David Cameron announced the date for the EU referendum in February , with the referendum itself held on June , a mere four months later.The referendum campaign lasted a matter of weeks, trying to get across what were often highly complex issues, against a background of half-truths and disinformation.Remember the £ million on the side of a bus and spending irregularities There was no clear idea of what Brexit actually meant, with those campaigning for leave promoting often contradictory views.The electorate was  presented with a blank sheet of paper, acting on blind faith as to what Brexit meant.The Scottish independence referendum date was announced in March , a year and a half before the actual vote.The electorate fully debated the key issues.In November , the Scottish government published Scotland#s Future, a -page white paper laying out the case for independence and the means through which Scotland might become an independent country.Contrast this with the Brexit campaign.The concern of some in the SNP can be shared, but it should be noted that the circumstances for a people’s vote are very dferent from an independence referendum.Ultimately the public has a right to change its mind, that’s democracy.Many did not know what they were voting for when it came to the EU referendum and I doubt many voted to make themselves poorer, with the continuing negative impact on our economy and society.Alex Orr,Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"letter baseless a83 rest criticism","story":"In response to Councillor Reid’s letter regarding the Rest and Be Thankful, in

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"long-serving-coach-driver-retires-after-30-years","story":"Tranent man Alec Napier, who turned  on October , said he was looking forward to le in the slow lane.ldquoIrsquoll be taking it easy and letting someone  do the driving, said Alec.ldquoIrsquove stayed in lots of nice, and some not-so-nice, hotels in my time.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

The gradient approaches almost  per cent in places, forcing me to engage first gear on occasion, and averages four per cent over a distance of five miles as it rises to ftat Glenshee Snowsports Centre.My eyes flick between the dashboard milometer ndash ldquoonly mph! ndash and the wonders of the spectacular scenery. But it feels very good to be able to take my time. I have just embarked on a four-day journey around a new tourist trail, the North East  , and I feel no pressure to be anywhere soon.So, at regular intervals, I pull into roadside laybys, alight the van and stand miniscule amid the high-rise terrain. I turn full -degrees to fully absorb the long road and the mountain peaks in almost every direction.At the ski resort, which is busy with determined late-season skiers, I am reminded of a walk many years previously when I summited two of Scotlandrsquos ldquoeasiest Munros. To qualy as a Munro, a mountain must be at least ft tall, but thanks to the height reached by road a hike to the top of Carn Aosdaand The Carinwellrequires less than . miles of walking and just ft of elevation gain. For such a short mountain hike the vistas of the wider Cairngorms are very rewarding.Hiking in summer ndash and skiing in winter ndash are only two activities on a long list of attractions on the NE. Along the -mile circular route, which passes through Speyside, Moray, Aberdeenshire and Royal Deeside, as well as the Cairngorms, I discover seemingly myriad places to see and things to do.Beaches, golf courses, nature reserves, mountain biking and walking trails, whisky distilleries, castles, churches, museums and heritage centres each beckon me to stop, visit and enjoy.Perhaps yoursquove not yet heard of the NE, yet I expect you already know of another Scottish road route, the North Coast . The -mile tour around the north-west of Scotland was launched in  and is now world famous. It has brought a signicant boost to visitor numbers and revenue in the area.Indeed, a study by the University of Glasgow estimates the NC attracted , extra visitors and pound million additional spend in its first year.Now the creator of the NE, local businessman and owner of Ballindalloch Castle, Guy Macpherson-Grant, hopes to generate a similar economic injection to the north-east. Guy said: ldquoI believe the new route offers visitors the very best that Scotland has to offer. Irsquom excited by the potential of the North East  to bring more visitors to our area.Back on the NE, I enjoy a swt descent through heather-covered moorlands to the village of Braemar. The popular tourist village brims with sightseeing opportunities, such as the royal residence of Balmoral Castle, th century Braemar Castle and Crathie Kirk.The NE travels north again, leaving behind busy Braemar for more wilderness landscapes. The route turns sharp west on to a smaller road, the A, heading for Cock Bridge, before passing another ski resort, The Lecht, and descending again to Tomintoul, the highest village in the Highlands at m.A wildly beautul drive, yoursquoll feel remote from civilisation yet at Tomintoul you enter the vibrant Glenlivet Estate. The rolling hills and fertile soils have attracted people to live and work in the area since prehistoric times.Glenlivet Estate and the wider Moray Speyside region are synonymous with whisky making and another tourist route, the Malt Whisky Trail, meets the NE to offer many options for visiting distilleries and a historic cooperage.Walkers and mountain bikers will also delight in a network of waymarked trails across the estate.From Tomintoul, the NE departs the Old Military Road, originally built in the mid-s to pacy the Highlands under instruction of Major William Caulfeild, and follows a peaceful road to the whisky settlements of Knockandhu and Glenlivet before joining a busier road, the A, just south of Ballindalloch.On reaching Aberlour, also home to a picture-postcard whisky distillery, I take up my booking for a campervan pitch at the newly upgraded Speyside Gardens Camping and Caravan Park. Husband and we owners Olly and Amy Lyon are anticipating greater numbers of guests thanks to the NE.Olly said: ldquoWe believe the NE route will introduce our beautul area to many more people and hopefully it will bring a boost to local businesses and attractions.Already I have seen so many more tourism gems than I ever knew existed and my journey is not even a third completed.I am fortunate with the spring weather although many locals are keen to tell me how much sunnier and drier it is in the north-east of Scotland compared to the west. ldquoMind, it can be a couple of degrees cooler, one shop owner told me.From Aberlour, the NE continues north to reach Spey Bay on the Moray Firth. The landscape changes from gently undulating farmland to flatter coastal plains before I see the sea. This coast is popular for wildle spotting, especially dolphins.Several former fishing settlements, such as Findochty, Portnockie and Cullen, feature must-see historic harbours and pretty beaches. I find myself meandering slowly between each before I park up and investigate a coastal walking path that links the settlements.A well-trodden trail from Cullen takes me to a cove to view a slanted arched rock called Whales Mouth. Further along the shore at Portknockie is the striking sea arch, Bow Fiddle Rock.Back on the road going east, I spot another signpost, this time for Findlater Castle. While the ancient building is in ruins, the airy clf-top location is magnicent.I have another campervan pitch for the night near Banff but before booking in the calm, bright evening affords me the time to explore the grounds of Duff House, a Georgian estate house owned by Historic Scotland.Almost half way around the -mile tourist trail, I set off on day three for the longest section of my trip. I might normally expect to drive  miles in less than two hours but it takes me almost  hours because there is so much to see.My first port of call is the tiny settlement of Pennan, made famous as the fictional village of Ferness in the s film Local Hero. The road down ndash and back up ndash is crazily steep but well worth it for the picturesque setting.I follow another hillier coastal path on foot to Aberdour Bay, where I discover a string of sandy coves hidden between rocky clfs.Driving further east and then south through the large fishing town of Fraserburgh, the eastern coast of Aberdeenshire serves up more fabulous landmarks. Atmospheric Bullers of Buchan is a collapsed sea cave, located adjacent to a precariously perched hamlet.Next is Slains Castle, an imposing clf-top ruin accessed by a narrow sandy road. The castle is said to be the inspiration for the  novel Dracula.The beaches are long, plentul and sandy on Aberdeenshirersquos coast. Near the village of St Fergus I follow a tourist sign for Scotston Beach where I am rewarded by a superb stretch of yellow sand brilliantly hidden behind high grass-topped dunes.The NE skirts the north-eastrsquos largest settlement of Aberdeen, although there is no reason why you shouldnrsquot visit. In fact, many people will choose to start and finish the NE at the granite city.After a night at the largest caravan park of my trip at Maryculter, west of Aberdeen, I drive the final  miles of the loop. Heading west through beautul Royal Deeside country the attractions come thick and fast, including the th century tower house of Crathes Castle with its lovely gardens and a Go Ape adventure course the nature reserve of Muir of Dinnet and Forestry Scotlandrsquos Cambus orsquo May trails.Soon I can see the mountains of the Cairngorms again and I drive back through Braemar, stopping for a lovely cafeacute lunch, before entering the long glen, this time downhill, back to Spittal of Glenshee.On reflection, I wished I had taken a week rather than four days to travel the NE ndash and I know I willsoon.Travel notes:Day : Overnight at Speyside Gardens Camping and Caravan Park. www.speysidegardensDay : Overnight at Wester Bonnyton Caravan and Camping Site, Gamrie, Banff. www.westerbonnytonDay : Overnight at Deeside Holiday Park, Maryculter. www.woodleisure our-parks deeside I hired a Fiat Tribute  campervan from Open Road Scotland, near Glasgow Airport, to drive the NE.

Certainly, on the night they appeared at Glasgow Universityrsquos Queen Margaret Union, supported by local rockrsquonrsquoroll heroes, The Primevals, the atmosphere in the dressing room was toxic. Not in a ldquobad vibes sense, but because the amount of hairspray required was asphyxiating.And that was, as they say, just the boys. Another unique selling point of the band formed by ex-Generation X bassist Tony James and fronted by the flamboyant Martin Degville was an all-female road crew. Mark Mackie, who had begun working with promoters Regular Music having been entertainment convenor at the QMU as a student, remembers that they had certainly not been recruited for their equipment-lugging physique ndash and the stiletto heels they wore were not ideal for that job either.All of which was a far cry from the QMU of  years earlier, when a generation of s feminists ran the place, and some of that erse history will be recalled when the th anniversary of the building at the end of University Gardens is remembered during an evening of Glam Rock Dialogues at the end of this month.These occasional evenings of debate, music, feather boas and extravagant eye make-up were initiated by Glasgow University academics David Archibald and Carl Lavery, and have in the past included musical input from the rhythm section of Franz Ferdinand and the songs of Bowie and Bolan to accompany discussion of the political legacy of revolutionary France. The spirit of  will be present on November  again, because it was then that the Queen Margaret Unionrsquos present home, a modernist design by Glasgow architects Walter Underwood and Partners, opened.Archibald says he and Lavery will be taking a less prominent part in this event, however, as befits the celebration of a facility built for women, whose numbers at the university had outgrown the QMUrsquos previous home in the John McIntyre Building on University Avenue. The key contributors to the St Andrewrsquos Day event will be female, with narration by Theatre Studies lecturer Cristina Delgado-Garcia and testimonies from current QMU president Mata Durkin, and Christine Hamilton, whose tenure on the board was in the buildingrsquos earlier years.Hamilton says that, as was said of the s,you can remember which bands you saw at the QM you werenrsquot really there. But she also claims that Freddie Mercuryrsquos Queen played there so often in her day that one of the band suggested it would be easierthe QM audience travelled to them.ldquoBut I mostly remember the politics at the time, because men were only allowed in as guests and could only be signed in after noon. These were the years of student protest and a wave of feminist consciousness-raising and we wanted the place to be mixed. It almost seems like we have come full-circle now, to be arguing for women-only spaces.Hamilton had come to Glasgow from a state school in Fe and found that the womenrsquos union was traditionally run by young ladies from private schools who still lived at home, and were not minded to fight for sexual equality. ldquoThey would say things like they didnrsquot want men to be able to see them first thing in the morning without their make-up! she says.Hamilton, who heard shipyard union leader Jimmy Reidrsquos rousing speech when the students elected him Rector of Glasgow University, stool as part of a slate of women from state schools who lived in student flats. They wrested control of the QM, although it was a few years before their argument for equality led to a mixed union, and Glasgow University Union ndash the ldquomenrsquos union ndash persisted with male-only membership, barring women from certain parts of the building, for many years.ldquoIt was equality that we were fighting for, although some women would point out that the level of power and control of budgets they had enjoyed in running the show at the QM was something they might never have again for the rest of their lives.Christine Hamilton studied drama and went on to a career in the arts and then in academia but the friendship she made through the QM board brought her long-term friends in the worlds of science and medicine as well.ldquoThey were women who made their way in the world independently and continued to work, and were not content to merely become lsquogood housewivesrsquo.At a time of draconian licensing laws, she says, the QM was unusual in arguing for and winning a regular late licence for music and dancing. ldquoIt was a huge amount of fun, but it was not just a social club ndash I remember some very edgy debates, including one I was chairing on Northern Ireland where we had to clear the gallery.Nonetheless, it was the bands that brought most students to the QM, and Hamilton said that her generation had rules about them. ldquoI was told: never touch the boys in the band, and never pine after them ndash because there will be another one along next week!By the start of the following decade, the QM was a mixed facility and Mark Mackie was studying marine science, living in a bedsit on Byres Road and eating every day in the union. When the catering was out-sourced, he stood for election to the board on a ticket to have the food he liked restored. In that aim, Mackie concedes that he failed, but he now runs one of Scotlandrsquos main music concert companies, Regular Music, all because he started helping out with the discos on Fridays and Saturdays.Frequent visits by bands to the QM had stopped when Mackie became entertainments convener and he wanted to put that right, as someone who enjoyed going to live music. He started local and his first concert was Del Amitri supported by the Suede Crocodiles with a Malibu drinks promotion and a ticket price of pound.. Other Scottish bands followed ndash The Bluebells and Lloyd Cole and the Commotions ndash before a Runrig gig gave him his first sell-out.With the bar takings more than justying the concerts and the tickets price covering the band fees, Mackie argued for an upgrading of the venue, with the installation of proper power supply and the building of a new stage to replace the low  that had been in use throughout the s .ldquoHaving cut my teeth with the Scottish groups, I started making calls to agents ndash and the QM was back on the circuit, he remembers.When The Smiths played at the very start of their fame, and their single This Charming Man newly in the charts, frontman Morrissey arrived by himself by train ahead of the band. With newspapers clamouring to speak to him, Mackie insured that the only interviews he gave were with the Glasgow Universityand the film and television students running the campus television channel ndash conducted on the roof of the QM.Mackie reels off an impressive list of bands that he put on at the venue, either as Ents Convenor or in the years immediately after, when he began working with Pete Irvine and Barry Wrightrsquos company , liaising with the students who followed him in the post. The Pogues, Was Not Was, Billy Bragg, Spear of Destiny, Big Audio Dynamite, The Waterboys, Slade and the aforementioned Sigue Sigue Sputnik ndash the s happened in full bloom at the QM.ldquoThe ticket money covered the cost of putting on the gigs, andwe sold out there would be  people drinking beer, so there was no way not to make money, says Mackie. A further tweak to the constitution of the student union gave board members dispensation to ldquosign in up to  non-students each, so effectively there was an open door policy that worked around local licensing laws.David Archibald also remembers regulations being less than scrupulously enforced in his teens so that he regularly saw bands there, including Wet Wet Wet, who had gone to the same school. He also recalls music being very male-dominated at that time, which he intends will not be that case at the Glam Rock Dialogues, with women in the band and well as in speaking and singing roles.Nonetheless there will be room for a male drummer who has a doctorate in the history of pop music, and another former QM ents convenor on keyboards, Ronan Breslin, now a lecturer at Glasgow School of Art.Much of the musical history of the Queen Margaret Union will be covered by the DJ who takes over until pm after the live performance, and Archibald is keeping the set-list for the live band under wraps until the night. However, smart money suggests that the greatest hit of Nirvana, who famously performed there on the same date, November , back in , is pretty certain to be included in some form.

Such an agreement will be negotiated before the end of the transition period.The EU document adds: ldquoAny decision on the extension of the transition period will take into account the fulfilment of obligations by the United Kingdom under the agreement, including its protocols.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has said the inclusion of such language in the political declaration was explicitly rejected, stressing how there was no commitment to maintain existing EU access to UK waters.During her Commons statement on Thursday, the PM told MPs: ldquoWe have firmly rejected a link between access to our waters and access to markets.ldquoThe fisheries agreement is not something we will be trading off against any other priorities. We are clear that we will negotiate access and quotas on an annual basis, as do other independent coastal states such as Norway and Iceland.David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, has been equally adamant that there would be no trade-off between EU access and UK trade.Yet Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, accused the UK Government of ldquoselling out Scottish fishermen while her colleague Ian Blackford, who leads the SNP at Westminster, accused the PM and her colleagues of using UK fishing rights as a ldquobargaining chip in talks with the EU towards securing a fishing agreement by the summer of  before the transition is due to end in December of that year.Indeed, Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson, who represents Aberdeen South, said of the UK-EU political declaration that ldquosovereignty over our waters sacriced for a trade deal\".Scottish Tory MPs have been particularly forceful in seeking assurances from Mrs May about the Brexit process and fishing with Mr Mundell signalling he would resignany transition period extension kept Scottish fishermen tied to the hated Common Fisheries Policy.On Friday, No  pointed out how Mrs May had been ldquovery strong on the point of fears over a trade-off between EU fishing access and Britainrsquos desire for a post-Brexit trade deal.ldquoThe PM said we are going to become an independent coastal state and rejected a link between access to our waters and access to markets and the agreement is not something we are going to trade off against any other priorities.Mrs Mayrsquos spokeswoman knocked back any suggestion of an addendum to the Withdrawal Agreement or Political Declaration to offer a side deal. She said: ldquoThe PM set out exactly what the agreement means for fishing and that is our position.Meanwhile, Fishing for Leave claimed that Protocol Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement ran a ldquocoach and horses through ministerial promises, declaring: ldquoThe Government has already flagrantly capitulated on markets and access being linked by agreeing to Article .Referring to the single customs territory, this says that fishery and aquaculture products will ldquonot be coveredhellipunless an agreement on access to waters and fishing opportunities is applicable between the Union and the United Kingdom.Fishing for Leave added: ldquoThe Government has therefore, in breach of all promises, already agreed that unless the UK cough up access for EU boats to continue fishing in British waters, then the EU will deny access for fisheries and aquaculture products.ldquoThe PM saying this is not the case at the dispatch box...means shersquos either an idiot or a liar.In response, a UK Government spokeswoman said: \"Wersquove been clear that we will be an independent coastal state after we leave the EU. Throughout this process we have successfully resisted attempts from the EU to secure access to UK waters on current terms.

roads, landscaped gardens and schools, the lower tier schemes where slum dwellers were placed were bland and monochrome with muddy courtyards.They were also and devoid of decent roads, shops, schools or a church.And while the more privileged families were able tocalled in favours from well-connected figures of influence to secure homes in first and second-tier areas such as West Drumoyne, those at the bottom of the heap faced humiliating and degrading treatment from housing officials, says Mr Damer.Despite the disparity, the horric conditions of Glasgowrsquos early th century slums at Cowcaddens, Calton, Garngard and Townhead meant post-First World War families were grateful to make the move.In , almost half a million Glaswegians were squashed into small rooms and kitchens, most with shared outside toilets or lavatories set up on inside landings, and, in a few startling cases, with as many as , even up to , children per family.In the worst ldquobacklands slums, the population density reached  people per acre ndash giving Glasgow a dire reputation for more slums and worse conditions than any other city in Britain.Various housing acts promised vastly improved conditions.However, according to Mr Damer, deep-set Victorian attitudes meant there was little sympathy for those surviving in the worst conditions, battling war wounds and TB in densely-packed tenements with little ventilation, sunlight or sanitation.ldquoTo Victorians, these people were feckless, the great unwashed lsquoPeople of the Abyssrsquo, he says.ldquoThere had been a great debate in late Victorian years about what to do with them.ldquoThere was cholera and typhus in the slums that killed middle-class people and they couldnrsquot have that.ldquoDebate raged between those who wanted to rehouse them and those who wanted them to die out.ldquoSo when the State passed legislation saying local councils had to build housing for working class people, the Corporation was trapped in its whole ideologically becausethe slum dwellers did not deserve good housing they should not get it.ldquoPeople were reluctantly rehoused, he adds.ldquoAndthey were to be rehoused, they were getting the kind of house in the kind of area they deserved.A three-tier system was established which meant people considered to be upstanding, clean and capable were given homes in leafy schemes such as Mosspark, while others considered respectable skilled and semi-skilled blue collar workers were handed keys for homes in places like West Drumoyne.Many climbed the housing ladder after calling in favours from well-connected figures of influence.For those at the bottom of the heap, however, the process was much more harshwere treated harshlyfaced humiliating and degrading treatment from corporation staff and they often moved en masse, taking the stigma of the slum with them.ldquoCorporation officials treated people in re-housing schemes as a homogeneous bunch of wasters so they treated them in a very authoritarian manner, adds Mr Damer, who used interviews captured with original slum-dwelling families to create a picture of le in the new schemes.ldquoIn spite of official belief that people are thick, the vast majority of people who moved were so delighted with their new houses that they were clean and well managed.Once consigned to live in a slum-clearance scheme, stigma and prejudice followed families for generations.ldquoIt was inevitable that this pernicious ideology would overflow into the council housing management practice of Glasgow Corporation, adds Mr Damer in hisbook.ldquoConsequently, generations of Glasgowrsquos council housing managers have been imbued with authoritarian attitudes towards, especially, the tenants of tenemental rehousing schemes.Scheming by Seacutean Damer is published by Edinburgh University Press Ltd."},{"url":null,"title":"arlene-foster-eu-withdrawal-text-not-in-nis-long-term-interests","story":"The country would

Albaredahope readers will Make Someones Day on St Andrews Day on November  and to then celebrate our art and culture on Fair Saturday on December  to help raise funds for good causes. Well, thanks to a new campaign by the Scottish Government, we don’t have to imagine the outcome.For that dream will become a reality on November , with people across the country being asked to commit to doing something nice for someone  on St Andrew’s Day.The Maake Someone’s Day initiative aims to celebrate our generous nature.On Saturday, December , we’re also being invited to take part in the first Fair Saturday here, a celebraion of art and culture while raising funds and awareness for charities.A helping hand...making someones day need not cost a penny. Why not pop in on an elderly relative or neighbour and make their day Founded in Spain in  to combat Black Friday’s commercialism, it is now a global movement.But Scotland is the first nation to sign up as a whole.Ben Macpherson, Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development, was delighted to launch the initiative.He said: “This St Andrew’s Day presents an inspiring opportunity for people in Scotland, in all our ersity, to celebrate the inclusive, outward-looking and compassionate spirit of our nation – by helping others and showing our generosity.Pause for thought...consider buying a homeless person a hot meal or drink to help make their St Andrews Day.“We can all show the best of what it means to be Scottish by each doing something small to #MakeSomeonesDay. “If each of us does something kind for someone , together we can make a hugely positive impact.“We wanted our national day to act as a focal point to showcase the Scots’ generous spirit and nature.data-src\"https:images.johnstonpress jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Missing teenager Liam Smith\"  Liam Smith: Search widens viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"“This is not about how much you can spend it’s about little acts of kindness that mean so much more.“We’re asking people to make time for elderly neighbours, donate goods to charity shops, hold a charity bake sale at work, volunteer time to a good cause or gt a meal or hot drink to a homeless person.“Everyone can get involved – all you have to do is make someone’s day.”The initiative is tied in with Fair Saturday which next year will take place on St Andrew’s Day itself.Ben added: “We’re linking in with the event this year so we can build up to having a major celebration in .“Fair Saturday gives communities across the country a chance, through arts and culture, to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the st century.“We live in a multiculural and erse society and we want to celebrate that.“Fair Saturday offers the perfect  to do that.”First staged in Bilbao in , the Fair Saturday movement is spearheaded by social entrepreneur Jordi Albareda.It has since been adopted by Malaga, Santander and Huelva in Spain, Milan and Pisa in Italy, Lima in Peru and Bristol in England.However, Scotland is the first nation to sign up.Jordi said: “When we began the Fair Saturday movement, we wanted countries all over the world to embrace its ideals of creating social impact through arts and culture. “It is fitting that Scotland is hosting the first nationwide Fair Saturday festival outside of Spain.“Scotland is a nation that focuses on ersity, multiculturalism, social empathy, kindness and, of course, arts and culture. “So it made complete sense for us to deliver the movement here. It is the most vibrant case of Fair Saturday to date.“In a time of building walls, we want to build bridges to connect people, cities, communities and cultures. “Millions of people working together surely must be stronger than some irresponsible global leaders.“We hope the Scottish people will mobilise behind our aim of creating a better future for all.”Some  events have already been organised in  cities and towns across Scotland on Fair Saturday, December .And the movement will also be celebrated in more than  locations globally.Jordi said: “More than  cultural events with a social impact will be taking place around the world.“Could you imagine the day when millions of people take part  It would send such a powerful message – that’s our aim for the future.”Fair Saturday aims to make people reflect on how arts and culture and social causes contribute to society. So all its events support a social cause of their choice in one of three ways:By recognising the charity’s workBy allowing the charity to spread its message to a wider audienceBy contributing to the charity’s work via ticket sales and donations.November  and December  in Scotland will also serve as a perfect antidote to Black Friday’s commercialism, which initially prompted Fair Saturday’s launch.Jordi added: “We connected with the Scottish Government thanks to our British Council in Bilbao in late  and are delighted to launch our first Fair Saturday here this year.“We believe it is one of the best nations in the world in which to start the journey. “Scotland’s National Day is all about sharing, giving and being kind. That tells you a lot about its people.”Visit www.scotland.org events st-andrews-day makesomeonesday to find out more or share your good deed at #MakeSomeonesDay.Fair fight back against Black FridayFair Saturday aims to mobilise people through social empathy rather than commercialisim – being staged the day after Black Friday to make that point.Jordi Albareda, its founder, convinced  choirs to perform in Bilbao, Spain, on November , , in dferent locations around the city at the same time. The result was incredible more than  people attended, raising more than  Euros for social causes.Since then, the movement has continued to grow, with more cities, cultural and social organisations and supporters joining along the way.Jordi said: “We are living in a material world. It prevails over humanity. “The strong desire of having has taken over from the profound aspiration of being. But living to the fullest is mostly about love. “In the last hours of our lives we won’t remember the things we owned but rather the people we loved.“Black Friday is one of the most irrational days of the year strong proof of a growing materialist system, based on the short term and unsustainable. “We do not pretend to fight against Black Friday but we do offer a positive alternative.“It’s all about culture before materialism. Social empathy before greed. “It’s a day to be better following a day to have more.”As for the future, Jordi hopes to target one of the world’s largest commercial markets – America.He added: “We are already taking the first steps to develop the movement in the USA in  and we’re expecting more European cities to get involved too.“Black Friday may be popular but surely Fair Saturday makes more sense.”To support Fair Saturday and find out about events in your area, visit the website at https:app.fairsaturday.org.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Saturday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amSome Orkney Islands Council facilities, such as schools, care homes and marine services,  may face IT disruption this weekend as the council carries out further repairs to a vital fibre optic link which was damaged on November .

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are a number of potential routes we could now take with them – some of which offer us the opportunity to generate income, some to make savings # and officers will be exploring these opportunities in due course.”According to OIC, the Stewart Endowment Trust disperses the majority of its funds locally, including to NHS Orkney. The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Saturday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson scented blood.In the end, the hard Brexiteers on the Conservative benches at Westminster could not - or, at least, have not yet - mustered the numbers they require to begin the process of trying to remove the Prime Minister from office.As the saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger and so Mrs May heads to yet another EU summit tomorrow more secure in her position than she has been for some time.The Scotsman continues to believe the UK’s departure from the EU is a mistake that will damage the economy and lessen the nation’s standing on the international stage but, in the absence of a second referendum, this is a process which will grind to its grim conclusion in March next year.This being so, it is our belief that Mrs May has a duty to do whatever she can to ameliorate the most damaging impact of Brexit. As she meets fellow leaders, we hope she will think first of this responsibility rather than of how she might placate the more excitable members on the Conservative backbenches.Those at Westminster who advocated most enthusiastically for Brexit have, in the two years since the EU referendum, repeatedly failed to explain how the painless break with Europe that they promised might be achieved. Their reassurances that the UK could dictate terms and that the EU would gladly comply have long since been exposed as fantasy.This reality, we have no doubt, will not prevent the continuation in the days and weeks ahead of nonsensical claims that they could have negotiated a stronger deal than the one Mrs May has secured. The EU has always had the upper hand in these negotiations and no amount of bluster from Brexiteers could have changed that.The legacy of the  vote is a ided country. A deal – the \u2028only deal on the table – that will satisfy neither Leavers nor Remainers will do nothing to repair that schism.This, we take no pleasure in concluding, was always going to be the case.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4834364.1543003206!/image/image.jpg","title":"stephen jardine in praise of a stirring christmas tradition","story":"Here#s a stirring way to start the magic of Christmas, writes Stephen Jardine.At it’s worst it can be an excuse for things that really belong in the pastthey cannot adapt to the modern world. Anyone who watched the documentary this week about the antiquated attitudes to women surrounding the Hawick Common Riding will know exactly what I’m talking about. However some traditions are worth preserving exactly as they are. Like Stir Up Sunday.Tomorrow, people across Britain will make the pudding that will be the crowning glory of the great feast in  weeks time. It is a food and drink tradition like no other.In an age of instant gratication, Stir Up Sunday is the opposite of that. It is the promise of good things to come but just a lot of washing up right now. Like so many of our festive traditions, it has it’s roots in Victorian times. The origins of the Christmas Pudding are medieval but Prince Albert made it fashionable in the th century and started the habit of families making it together. The last Sunday before Advent provides time for the puddings to mature and the general prayer read in churches gave the day it’s nickname : “Stir up, we beseech thee O Lord, the wills of they faithful people”. The people making their Christmas Puddings at home are nothingnot faithful. The supermarkets report declining sales as more and more customers turn instead to lighter alternatives. Only % of us will sit down to Christmas Pudding on December th.The other % will be opting for everything from clementine pavlovas to gingerbread cheesecakes. Tesco now sells three times as many Christmas Pudding alternatives as it did just  years ago. However that hasn’t put off the Stir Up Sunday traditionalists. If shop sales of puddings are falling, the home made iety is bucking the trend. That may be down to the pervasive influence of social media. After all, a Sunday spent making and stirring a pudding is a very Instagram friendly activity. With a few tiny tweaks, it is also suitable for vegans. With more and more people choosing that way of eating, a pudding full of fruit and booze that ticks the right boxes is something worth preserving.But over and above all that,what keeps Stir Up Sunday going is the tradition itself. In an age where the weekend can just mean dferent generations sitting in dferent rooms staring at dferent screens, making the pudding for Christmas Day is a simple shared activity no one can object to. According to tradition, as many members of the family as possible should be involved with the youngest giving it the first stir and the eldest giving it the last. Proper pedants also insist it should be stirred east to west to mimic the journey the Three Wise Men took to Bethlehem but that may be taking tradition too far. Several hours of mixing and boiling will give you a kitchen full of the smells of Christmas and a pudding for the day itself.Of course it is too rich and heavy but that’s not really the point.If the festive season is about family and sacred traditions, a few hours spent making a proper pudding is as good a way as any to start the magic of Christmas. ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4834432.1543008945!/image/image.jpg","title":"mp vote cannnot rewrite brexit deal with eu argues theresa may","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa May insisted her Brexit deal with the European Union could not be rewritten, arguing the UK would not get a #better deal#MPs rejected the agreement.The Prime Minister is facing demands from MPs across the political spectrum to abandon her plan and go back to the negotiating table, while the Spanish government has stepped up efforts to secure concessions over Gibraltar.In a BBC phone-in as part of her drive to sell the agreement to the public, Mrs May yesterday insisted there was no mood on the EU side for fresh concessions.“If we were to go back to the European Union and say ‘people didn’t like that deal, can we have another one ’, I don’t think they are going to come to us and say ‘we will give you a better deal’,” she said.“This is the deal that I think works for the UK.”Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab – a committed Leaver who quit last week over the agreement – earlier said he believed the terms were so bad the UK would be better off remaining in the EU.“I’m not going to advocate staying in the EU,” he told the BBC Radio  Today programme. “Butyou just presented me terms, this deal or EU membership, because we would effectively be bound by the same rules, but without the control or voice over them, yes, I think this would be even worse than that.”With more than  Conservative MPs from both the Leave and Remain sides threatening to vote against the agreement, Mr Raab warned it was unlikely to get through the Commons. He said ministers should consider leaving without a deal. “We will, I think, see Parliament vote this deal down,” he said. “And then some other alternatives will need to come into play.”Mrs May, however, warned rejection of her plan would lead to more “uncertainty and ision” and said the public now wanted the government to get on and deliver Brexit.“In Parliament there’s a lot of focus on who’s going to vote for the deal or not, and outside I think people are thinking ‘actually, let’s make sure we can get this through and get on with delivering’,” she said. “If this deal doesn’t go through we are back at square one. What we end up with is more uncertainty and more ision.”Despite the turmoil, the Prime Minister again insisted that as far as she was concerned, Brexit would go ahead next year as planned.“Personally, there is no question of no Brexit because the government needs to deliver on what people voted for in the referendum in ,” she said. “As far as I am concerned, the UK is leaving the European Union on  March .”The latest clash came as Mrs May was warned she faced a battle to reach a final agreement on her deal at a summit of European Union leaders tomorrow. Spanish premier Pedro Sanchez demanded last-minute changes to reflect Spain’s continuing concerns over the status of Gibraltar.Spain’s junior minister for the EU, Luis Marco Aguiriano, said: “We have a promise from the British government, saying they are ready to… guarantee that they will go along with the clarication we have requested.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested.

Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

stand-off.The breakthrough follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the scenes to get this result and more especially members of the local community who made sure that their voice was heard in the process.\"Well done to all.\"A positive community campaign had been launched called Save Our Swimming following the doors closing to HLH users at the end of the summer.SOS co-ordinator Joe Kirby described the agreement as a fantastic result for all the parties.He said: \"It is great that the council and Macdonald Hotels have listened to the concerns of the community and that a pragmaticto talks has delivered this deal.\"I know as a father myself that folk across the strath will be really looking forward to getting backing into the swimming pool with their children and other families members.\"Id like to thank everyone who wrote correspondence to

imploring him to let them go swimming again and local GPs and aquafit users ndash some in their eighties ndash had also gone public with their health concerns.There had also been several peaceful

Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all.

not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates -

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry. She also thanked the public for their cooperation during the works and the council staff for their efforts."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SKYE-CANCER-RES-STAFFIN-1.jpg","title":"meet donald the new animated face of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA local businessman from Skye has created an animated character with the aim of providing useful information to visitors to the island.Donald from Skye is an animated character and the star of a short film about the island.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost.

And he added that despite the fact that Remembrance Sunday was marked almost a fortnight ago, poppies are still being displayed by some staff – with some workers opting for the double-whammy of a banned football and the remembrance symbol.“Employees here are brazenly walking around in Rangers and Northern Ireland tops even though everybody knows the rules,” our source inside the factory said. “It’s not asCoca-Cola is a wee firm that employs two or three people in a shed. It’s a massive global company with strict rules in place to ensure harmony and equality and yet nothing is being done. People see other people wearing football tops and they think, ‘Oh, that’s allowed now.’ And the poppies are still around too as well as other symbols used by one side of the community. Sometimes they’re pinned to the banned jerseys.”The worker said that Catholic members of staff are disappointed by the lack of action by senior members of staff. He added that things would continue to get worse until existing policy is enforced.“Management have yet to do anything about it,” he said. No-one is even being talked to never mind disciplined for their actions.“Personally, I feel antagonised, intimidated and fearful working in a place that is allowing this to continue and I know others do too. This is a place of work and people should be able to come to work without being in fear or intimidated in this manner.”A spokesperson for Coca-Cola denied any knowledge of football shirts being worn in at the plant but pointed out that the wearing of poppies all year round is acceptable.“We are not aware of any recent instances of employees wearing football shirts at work. Doing so would be in contravention of our unorm and dress code policy. This follows the guidance of the NI Equality Commission which states that the wearing of football shirts has the potential to disrupt a good and harmonious working environment.“In line with the Commission’s guidance, we do not prohibit the wearing of a poppy at work.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renowned west belfast artist to set out stall at culturlann","story":"PROLIFIC West Belfast painter and illustrator Tony Bell is set to unveil a personal retrospective exhibition entitled ‘Special People Special Places’ at the Cultúrlann on Thursday November .

Now named Everest, the animal gave birth to a litter of six a week after making herself at home with Lisa, but just days later she rejected her newborns.This left Lisa - assisted by her husband and two daughters - facing the massive task of hand-rearing them all and so began a round-the-clock battle against the odds to keep the six little bundles alive, fed, watered and loved.Speaking to the Belfast , Lisa said: \"I took a call from a member of the public who said she had found a dog in a very distressed state so I told her to bring it to me.\"I was a bit surprised to see that the dog, which we called Everest, was heavily pregnant so I took her to the vet who told me she was ready to give birth at any time.\"We made a whelping area ready for her and she delivered six pups a week later.\"Everest, who, at around a year old is not much more than a pup herself, did well for the first week as a new mum but then kept sitting on her litter, burying them and dragging them by the back leg across the kitchen floor.\"I knew then I would have to step in or she would have killed the pups, so me, my two daughters and my husband worked around the clock bottle-feeding all six.\"The smallest one - we called him Tiny Tim because he was less than half the size of the others - had been bottle-fed from day one by me because he just wasnt going to survive,\" she said.\"He has done so well, in fact he did that well we couldnt call him Tiny Tim any longer and re-named him Arlo.\"New homes have been found for five of the litter and their mother, but the idea of parting with the puppy formerly known as Tiny Tim was too much for Lisa so he has become the latest rescue animal to join the Patton household. \"People have asked meit was hard to give them up and it was to an extent, but at the same time you are constantly cleaning up. \"They are lovely dogs who have gone to really good homes but I just couldnt part with Tiny Tim,\" she said."},{"url":null,"title":"foster eu withdrawal text not in nis longterm interests","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The recent Bill in Westminster has only a limited impact on those delays.\"Despite the suffering caused to our constituents, our families, our friends, there is simply no urgency around efforts to restore the Assembly.\"I have made clear to the Secretary of State she has a legal and moral duty to appoint an independent facilitator and get talks under way without any further delay. Waiting until the new year is unacceptable.\"She has nothing to lose - any party daring to refuse to attend and make every effort to end this suspension would stand condemned by their own actions and by the public, and rightly so.\"Further, their salaries should also be stoppedthey dont turn up. Karen Bradley needs to grasp the nettle and get on with it.\" Echoing Ms Longs call, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood added that the full scale of the political stalemate should come as a shock to no one. \"Without a ing Executive, major legislative decisions will merely catch dust on a departmental shelf,\" he said. \"It is time for the Secretary of State to stop sitting on her hands and convene a talks process immediately.\"There is a crisis in our health service, chronic underfunding in schools, our economy is barely growing and Brexit is on the horizon.\"We now urgently need a process to bring devolution back.\""},{"url":null,"title":"people rally round oap after sneak thief makes off with handbag containing","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Documents released under FoI legislation reveal how  decisions that cannot be taken have piled up in the absence of ministers. The figure will be higher because one of the nine departments, the Department of Finance, refused to answer our request.Some have been well publicised, such as the Programme for Government, which sets out the priorities that the Executive will pursue. Approval is also needed on a strategy to deal with suicide, an investment strategy and school development plans.However, there is also a range of lesser known legislation.This includes fishery management plans, remote control automated parking, reforming legal aid expenditure and amending the  Drainage Order.The Department for Communities has  decisions pending - the highest number.Among them is the Employment Act, which includes proposals to force large companies to disclose their gender pay gap. This has been held up by more than  days.A further  decisions are in line at the Department for Infrastructure.These include increasing penalties for using a mobile phone while driving, a series of planning applications and a planned trial scheme to allow certain taxis to use Belfasts bus lanes.The Department for the Economy has  decisions pending, including sign-off on a draft industrial strategy, draft energy strategy and a Superfast Broadband strategy.The Department of Justice has  outstanding decisions, including strategies on domestic violence and tackling paramilitary crime.At the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, decisions on fishery management and water quality monitoring have sat for more than  days.Several departments cannot make public appointments. For example, the Policing Board, which has oversight of the PSNI, has not met since early  because it has no political appointees.The DUP and Sinn Fein continue to blame each other for the impasse.DUP MLA Gordon Lyons said: \"Every day new issues arise which cannot be progressed because of Sinn Feins boycott policy.\"The public are suffering and limited powers for civil servants to take decisions are no substitute for democratically-elected representatives taking decisions in the best interests of everyone we represent.\"The DUP has put down no pre-conditions ahead of theof devolution. Its time that Sinn Fein dropped their red lines and put the needs of the public ahead of their narrow sectional interests.\"Sinn Fein said: \"It is the DUPs denial of rights, disrespect and lack of integrity that led to the collapse of the power-sharing institutions.\"Rather than commit to sharing power equally, the DUP then walked away from an agreement in February that would have seen the Assembly and the Executive restored.\"The institutions could be restored immediatelythe DUP, backed by the Tories, ends the disgraceful denial of rights which are enjoyed by citizens everywhere  on these islands.\""},{"url":null,"title":"ulster university to introduce irish language signs at students union","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

spinal condition","story":"A Ballinderry mum says she intends to raise more awareness of an advanced treatment for a rare spinal condition in that hope that it will be made available to children in the North.Donna Ferris’ three year-old son Charlie was diagnosed with progressive infantile idiopathic scoliosis when he was just six months old.If left untreated, the spinal deformity can lead to severe twisting of the spine, respiratory problems and even decreased le expectancy.When little Charlie was first diagnosed back in February , doctors in Belfast told his anxious parents Donna and Jodie that their only option was to put their son in a plaster jacket to hold in the curve in his spine until he was old enough for surgery.However, determined Donna vowed to do everything in her power to keep her baby son away from the operating table and invasive surgery.After hours of online research, the mum-of-four found a hospital in the United States which offers specialised scoliosis treatment.Donna discovered that Shriners Hospital in Philadelphia offered advanced treatment which could potentially avoid surgery.She said: “When I was researching I checked for hospitals in the east coast of America as I knew it would be easier to fly into there from Ireland.  I came across Shriners Hospital and made contact straight away askingthey accepted international patients.  They said they did and sent me some forms which I filled in.  Within four days of applying to the hospital for the treatment Charlie was accepted, and within a month he was at the hospital.”On April , , Donna, Jodie and their four kids made the trip to Philadelphia for Charlie’s first appointment.Just a few days later, Charlie was fitted with a Mehta cast which was specially designed to correct the curve in his spine.Over the last  months, Charlie has made the same journey  times.Before having his first cast fitted, the curvature in Charlie’s spine was at a -degree angle.Earlier this month, during their th trip to Shriners Hospital, the Ferris family received the news they had been hoping for.“They took Charlie’s brace off  hours after arriving at the hospital and sent him for x-rays.  After this the doctors brought us in and gave us the great news that Charlie’s spine is now down to six degrees,” said Donna.“I just burst into tears crying.  I just couldn’t believe it.  The staff at the hospital were also crying and hugging us.  They were just so, so happy.  They are always willing the children on there.  It was just amazing news to get.”Donna said before starting his treatment in the US, Charlie was a ‘very restless baby’ and she ‘really struggled to get food into him’.Now, she says her son is a completely dferent person.“The boy we have now is just perfect.  He is meeting all his milestones and is doing everything a wee child of his age should be doing and he will go on to lead a healthy le,” she said.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Charlie knows that he’s dferent and he has to wear a brace that not everyone  does but he’s adapted to it all from the get-go, he’s just brilliant.“The plan now is that Charlie will remain in brace until June next year and then he will switch to a night time brace for six months at least.  Hopefully he will not have to wear a brace at all eventually.”Following Charlie’s diagnosis and the news that he would have to travel to America for the specialised treatment, the Ballinderry and wider community set about fundraising for the family to help fund their travel, something which the Ferris family are ever grateful for.Donna also has nothing but praise for Shriners Hospital.“Words cannot describe how grateful we are to the hospital for what they have done for us,” she said.“When we first took him to the hospital we knew Charlie was going to be in expert hands as they specialise in infantile scoliosis.“We are so, so grateful to them and it’s very hard to put into words how good they all are.  They don’t just treat Charlie, they treat the whole family.  It’s the same people treating Charlie each and every time and he has become so familiar with them all.“Shriners is a non-profit hospital and they treat families regardless of their ability to pay.  All the time we have been there we have never received a bill from them.  To go half way across the world to another hospital and not be billed is just amazing.”Charlie’s journey over the last  months has been well documented by Donna on a Facebook page named ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’.Through the page, other parents in similar situations have reached out to Donna who has offered them support and advice.  She has also given them ‘hope of what can be achieved’.On November , Donna attended the Families First awards ceremony in Sligo Park Hotel where she was presented with an ‘Inspirational Person’ award – an accolade which she had been nominated for by a parent from Co Cavan.“I spoke to the audience and told them our story and I received a standing ovation afterwards.  I was just overwhelmed by how many people I have touched out there.  It was the perfect end to the perfect week.”Donna now hopes that by speaking out about Charlie’s treatment that it will give other children hope.“The treatment that Charlie received at Shriners Hospital has been available at Great Ormond Street Hospital since July this year however I really want it to become available across the UK and Ireland.“Charlie is living proof of what can be achieved by this gentle, non-invasive treatment so why not offer it to babies here and give them a chance.“I want to be able to help other children in our own country and want parents not to have to feel the need to travel abroad for adequate care.  I would just love to see this treatment available here so there is hope for other families.”To follow Charlie’s progress visit ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’ on Facebook."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOFxcXC8xMVxcXC8yMzE3Mjc0NFxcXC9TY3JlZW4tU2hvdC0yMDE4LTEwLTEyLWF0LTE1LjQ2LjEyLTc1MHgzNTAucG5nXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjY0NyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjM0MCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmRlcnJ5bm93LmNvbVxcXC9hc3NldHNcXFwvaVxcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmc_dj0xXCJ9IiwiaGFzaCI6Ijk3MmMxMTk4ZmE5YWU1MzJmN2Q4ODNmMTdkODBlMzc4Mjg5MWY1NmIifQ==/screen-shot-2018-10-12-at-15-46-12-750x350.png","title":"irish filmmaker wants james bulger film screened derry reopen debate case","story":"The writer and director of an award-winning film about the murder of Liverpool toddler, James Bulger, screening in Derry this weekend, said he hopes the film will open up a new debate on what made two -year-old boys murder a child.Vincent Lambe’s film, ‘Detainment’, is based on the true story of James Bulger, abducted in Liverpool in  and found brutally murdered two days later. However, the most shocking aspect of the case was that the main suspects were just children themselves - two ten-year-old boys, Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. Based on their interview transcripts, the film dramatizes the police interviews which took place at the time.Detainment stars Will O’Connell , David Ryan , Tara Breathnach , Morgan C. Jones , Brian Fortune , Kathy Monahan , and introduces two exceptional young actors, Ely Solan and Leon Hughes.Speaking to the Derry News, Vincent Lamb said that he hopes the film will challenge public perception of the boys who committed the murder and open a wider debate on the matter.When asked what drew him to the story, he replied: “I was asked that same question when I was over in London where I did an interview for Sky News the UK audience find it strange that an Irish filmmaker would be interested in something so deeply rooted in the British consciousness.“But it affected the people here in Ireland just as much as the people in the UK. I was  at the time it happened and I remember it very well.“I remember growing up hearing about it and heard it mentioned again as an adult and it was unexpected how I felt about it at the time.“I started reading everything I could find on it and then I got the transcripts [of the police interviews] and felt that I was seeing something not everyone  was seeing.”SensitiveVincent said that casting the child actors for the roles of Thompson and Venables was challenging but that the young actors, Ely Solanand Leon Hughes , who have been critically-acclaimed for their astonishing performances, were ‘phenomenal’.“I had a lot of apprehension about making a film on such a sensitive story,” he said.“The public outrage at the time was unprecedented and it hasn’t gone away, it’s still there. So many people just seen these boys as being evil and couldn’t cope with the fact that they were just two little boys. The only way they could make sense of it was to see them as evil.“Newspapers labelled them as ‘evil monsters’, the spawn of Satan’ and ‘freaks of nature. People hadn’t really looked at other points of view andyou did, you were criticised – people couldn’t see any other reason for it other than they were evil.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“When I was , I accepted that they must have been evil but as an adult when I researched it a bit more, my opinion altered and I hope that this film will help other people change their minds.“By looking into the boys’ family background, I got a better understanding of what could have led two -year-old boys to commit such a horrible crime.“This film is not sympathetic to the boys and is not trying to make an excuse for them in any way but it humanises them. People may be more comfortable thinking of them as evil monsters but, after reading the transcripts, it was a tragedy for three families and that’s not a popular opinion.“The film is entirely factual, there is no embellishment – it is almost entirely verbatim. When I was making the film, given my apprehensions, it was very important to me that everything was factual.”‘Prevent this happening again’Vincent said that he was especially nervous when he heard that journalist and expert of the James Bulger murder, David James Smith, was attending one a screening of the film at the Winchester Film Festival. Smith wrote a book on the matter, The Sleep of Reason: The James Bulger Case.“He turned up at the last screening in the UK and I was terried,” he said.“He’s such an expert on the case, I was dreading to hear what he thought but he said the film was ‘authentic’ and a ‘remarkable achievement’ which was an amazing endorsement.“He also wrote a lovely review saying thatthe audience were willing to find the truth out about those boys, they could not ignore their inescapable smallness.”“People don’t talk about this case enough, butyou have any other opinion other than the boys were monsters, it’s rejected and it stles debate on the issue. We want to prevent this happening again so we need to understand the case.“I remember the Judge’s comments about the boys and I thought it was a ludicrous decision to name them but the more I read, the more I understood his reasons – he wanted a discussion about it, to look into the background of the boys and see how something like could be prevented from ever happening again. I hope that people will debate the case again after watching the film.”Vincent finally had a word for the Bulger family: “I don’t want anyone to think that I don’t have sympathy for the Bulger family, I have enormous sympathy for little James, for what he went through and what his family have been through.”‘Detainment’ by award-winning director, writer and producer, Vincent Lambe and Irish producer, Darren Mahon, will screen at Foyle Film Festival in the Nerve Centre on Sunday, November , at pm.More information about the film and upcoming screenings can be found at: www.detainmentfilm"},{"url":null,"title":"people derry urged think twice visiting emergency department winter emerges ae altnagelvin dealing 230 people","story":"UP to  people are visiting the Accident and Emergency department in Altnagelvin Hospital every day, it has emerged.The figure emerged at Novembers meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Community meeting, where senior figures from the Western Trust were in attendance to discuss its Winter Resilience Plan  .Speaking at the meeting Geraldine McKay, Director of Acute Hospitals with the Trust, said that ‘demands’ were already very high on its services as it had experienced an increase in the numbers of people attending the AE department at Altnagelvin over the past year.She told the meeting that the eight per cent increase over the past year meant that the hospital was now dealing with  to  people on a daily basis, compared to a figure of  to  every day last year.Mrs McKay added that the bulk of people attending the department were Category  and Category  patients, who she said were the ‘sickest patients with the most complex needs’, adding that these patients would be in need of ‘immediate attention’, and required treatment within an hour.The meeting was told that the emergency department was facing additional pressures due to issues with gaining accesses to beds within the unit, adding that there also had been an increase in the numbers of people who have had to wait over  hours for treatment.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMrs McKay continued that it would be issuing an appeal through the media urging people to consider their condition before attending the local Accident and Emergency department.“We do believe there will be a tough winter ahead of us all, and we hope you can disseminate that information to people that they may not need to attend the Emergency Department,” she told the meeting.Mrs McKay also spoke of the extreme pressure placed on the department last winter due to the outbreak of the norovirus, and also urged people to take advice from their GPs on their condition before attending the AE.However, she also stressed thatpeople do feel that they must attend the unit, then they should not ‘take any chances’.“Go to your GP and take the advice,” Mrs McKay said.“If you need to the be there , then you need to there, because there are people who put off going there over the fear that there may be already large numbers there.”"},{"url":null,"title":"schools rely on parents dipping into their pockets","story":"County Hall Powys County Council Offices, Llandrindod Wells.\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"School budgets reliant on parentsCllr Emily Durrant.\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"newtowns railway station bidding for access upgrade","story":"Disabled access at Newtown railway station on Wednesday, November , .MS-ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt-lt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"Newtowns railway station bidding for access upgradeA general view of Newtown railway station on Monday, March , .Pic: Mike Shltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgteridan County TimesMltspan classtruncate-full-screengtS-lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" Newtowns railway station bidding for access upgradeA general view of Newtown railway station on Wednesday, November , .MS-ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt-lt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"angela receives highest uk air ambulance honour","story":"WAA Chief Executive Angela Hughes receives her Letime Achievement Award.\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"Angela receives highest UK Air Ambulance HonourWAArsquos fleet of four helicopters.\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"visiting tangent clubs luminary on hand to switch on llandrindod wells christmas lights","story":"Prize winners in the decorated lantern competitionreceive their prizes as Sue ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtHill presents Sophialtspan classtruncate-full-screengt Morgan with her first place award.

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site. General discussions have subsequently taken place with a number of potential developers about hotel provision in the Newcastle area,rsquorsquo he continued.ldquoThe council is also currently working with a consultant on the feasibility study for leisure provision in the Newcastle area and it is anticipated that a report will be presented to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee in the coming months..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan wildlife activist recognised by Prime Minster  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN teenager has been recognised by Prime Minister Theresa May for urging young people to protect the environment.Fourteen year-old Dara McAnulty is one of the latest recipients of the the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.He was presented with his award at an event held at Kew Gardens in London last week.Mrs May wrote to Dara congratulating him on his achievement.ldquoThrough your award-winning blog, you are encouraging young people to support their local environment and learn about the importance of conservation, she said.ldquoYour writing is raising awareness of how nature can help people cope with autism and you should feel proud of this remarkable achievement.Dara has been a driving force behind the Grassroots Challenge run by Ulster Wildle.In his blog he encourages other people his age to make videos of the out-doors and at the same time participate in conservation.Dara, who is autistic, says he is inspired by the beauty of the Mourne countryside on his doorstep and that developing a connection with nature helps him manage his anxiety.This in turn helped him to open the door for other people his age to become conservation enthusiasts too.Dara said: ldquoI am honoured to receive the Points of Light award. I sincerely hope that it shines a light on how vital nature is to us all, our mental health, our wellbeing and the survival of all le.ldquoWe need more young voices to speak up and take action for nature though. I will continue my work and hope that many more will follow.Dara recently worked with Springwatch presenter Chris Packham on The Peoplersquos Walk for Wildlecampaign.He spoke to , people at Hyde Park about conservation and also completed a -mile walk that raised over pound, to tag and record threatened birds of prey.He is soon to publish a book called lsquoDiary of a Young Naturalistrsquo based on his blog, which won runner-up in the BBC Wildle Magazine Blogger Awards.Charlotte Hill, CEO of Step Up To Serve, which coordinates the #iwill campaign, said: ldquoWe know that young people have the energy, ideas and drive to address issues in their community and to tackle many of societyrsquos tougher challenges.ldquoWe are so pleased to see the Prime Minister recognising the astounding achievements that Dara has made through his volunteering, fundraising and campaigning, and hope this inspires Dara and other young people to continue their fantastic work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Class act Connolly secures final spot  ","story":"RYAN Connolly was the hero of the hour as Olympic claimed their spot in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final and also claimed the bragging rights in Ballynahinch.Connolly made two saves in the penalty shoot-out and then converted the decisive spot kick at the end of a largely forgettable semi-final at Bignian Park on Friday night.Olympic will face either Killough or Celtic Bhoys, who meet this Friday night in the second semi-final at the same venue, in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Boxing Day showpiece at Drumaness.There was little to cheer the good-sized crowd who braved the Mourne chill well into the night.One hundred and ten minutes of football produced barely a handful of chances, which meant that all the excitement was reserved for the spot kick shoot-out.Connolly had little to do over normal and extra time, but he produced the goods when it mattered and was mobbed by his delighted team-mates after putting his spot kick past Raymond Tate in the YM goal.However, Olympic know they will have up their gamethey are to pose a threat to either Killough or Celtic Bhoys in the final.Neither they nor YM could be faulted for effort. The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out. Olympic deserved to win, but it was cruel on the Young Men.Ballynahinch Olympic II: R Connolly, J Roddy, D Russell, N McGlew, M Rice, S Marmion, J Fennell, G Wilson, R Patterson, D Travers, S Rodgers.

He was rushed to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he remained for seven days.The incident happened four years ago and Mackenzi is now a healthy teenager.However, he wants his story told as part of Blue November mdash a campaign to highlight awareness of diabetes, which has almost doubled in the last ten years.Mackenzi was accompanied to the hospital by his mum, Maria, who says she will never forget that night.ldquoI owe that nurse a debt of gratitude, she said. ldquoShe told us that he was just hours away from a diabetic coma and could have died as a result.ldquoMackenzi is the first child within our family to have the condition and thatrsquos why I was unable to recognise the first signs.ldquoHe was losing weight and drinking more fluids.

The problems of vandalism and high running costs have made it virtually impossible to keep going any longer.Crisis points are no strangers to the harassed members of the hall committee. Two years ago they ran into trouble when funds for the hall completely petered out.The hall fell into an appalling state of disrepair and a public appeal to raise pound, was launched. Only pound, was raised and since then the management committee have an uphill battle to survive.While the hall belongs to the community and is run by a committee appointed at public meetings, the nature of the trust deed, under which it is held, means that it cannot be taken over or run by the district council.The hallrsquos usefulness became redundant as the old style of social s was replaced by nights out at licensed restaurants and by public house entertainment.Mrs Katie Williams, the committee treasurer, said: ldquoAlthough we still have money problems, the main thing we have to break down is apathy among the townspeople.

I am sure that anyone with an interest in these matters will find it an invaluable reference document for their endeavours.The new publication has also been given a ringing endorsement by Dr Tim Campbell, Director of the Saint Patrick Centre in Downpatrick.He said: ldquoThis book illustrates how Downpatrickrsquos tourism hub around the Cathedral, Down County Museum and the Mound of Down could be linked off-road to every village in Lecale and rejoin the local way-marked trails like the Saint Patrickrsquos Way and Ulster Way to make a network of walks and cycle paths in East Down.The new book is available at Kevin Ogrsquos shop in Strangford, the St. Patrick Centre, The Road Houses Bar, Oakley Fayre, Down County Museum and Down Arts Centre.

They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

To kick us off, HELEN MCGURK reflects on her rural upbringing and a pet sheep with a very sweet tooth!One of my earliest memories is falling from a wobbly chair in our ‘working’ kitchen, as it was called, banging my head off the cold terrazzo tiles and swtly passing out. I must have been three or four at the time and I remember waking groggily from concussion to see a blurry vision of our local vet stooped over me, his cow dung-splattered hand taking my pulse. He was still wearing his green vet’s apron and wellies, having just helped my late father with a tricky calf delivery, and I can recall him saying to my worried parents: ‘‘She’ll be grand, just make sure she doesn’t fall asleep. Any problems, give me a call.’’It was the s and living on a farm, it was normal in our house for the vet to double as a doctor. In fact, I don’t think my father ever went to an actual doctorhe had an ailment it was discussed with the vet. What treatment he received I never knew – perhaps he was dispensed with a drench or a squirt of purple spray .I also remember the vet tending to me when I went over the handlebars of my clunky Chopper into a bed of nettles on that occasion a handful of dock leaves and a packet of Pacers, was all the medicine required. Despite the odd scrape, growing up on a farm was great fun it was the fresh-air-and-pink cheeks childhood I dream of my own children having. It was full of space and freedom. And, as all children do, I took it entirely for granted.It was an innocent childhood, where as a youngster I just merged with the surrounding mucky chaos. It was a time free from computers and technology, with a constant supply of mewling kittens to coo over and little lambs to feed, their tails jiggling in delight as they chugged milk from an old Lucozade bottle.Back then the summers always seemed to be scorching hot, even though in reality they would have probably ‘foundered’ you, and there were plenty of characters to keep us entertained like the neighbour who blessed his cows with holy water when they were calving, before muttering a mouthful of unprintable expletivesthe newborn was a scrawny-looking creature. And the old man who went years without a haircut, then decided it was time for a short, back and sides the barber got quite a shock when he discovered a woollen flat cap under his matted mane. My father had a dairy farm and grew a iety of crops including potatoes, hay, barley and corn. His favourite cow was called Georgina after a prim, God-fearing woman of indeterminate age who lived across the fields. Whether Georgina the Fresian heer was an atheist or a devout believer, I’ll never know, but she was given the name and it stuck. Georgina’s bovine predecessor was called Nancy, named after a softly spoken woman, with labradoodle hair who tootled up and down our road in a battered Mini and sucked on Murray Mints all day long until there wasn’t a tooth left in her head.

I fondly remember all the pets I ever had in particular, a black-faced Suffolk ewe, whom I called Curly and who, like all the others I had, went through a ‘baptism’ ceremony. Curly had been given free rein of our farmyard and would often amble up to the kitchen for a biscuit. She had an immensely sweet tooth and loved Digestives and Ginger Nuts. Custard Creams, she could take or leave.Poor Curly probably died of Type  diabetes, although I was only ever told she had gone on holidays to visit her cousins in Co Tyrone, a flock of n’er-do- wells by all accounts!For us, a holiday was a day trip to the Glenshane Passfor a picnic – a frugal repast which consisted of Salad Cream sandwiches, a French Fancy and a flask of stewed tea. But not knowing any dferent, I loved these excursions, as I did going to the bog, or the moss as we called it, to ‘foot turf’. ‘‘Sure, it’s like Butlins,’’ said my father, who had never been out of Ireland.I loved piling the freshly cut turf into little mounds, ‘stooks’, to dry, then breaking for tea out of a bottle and a few sweaty ham sandwiches. The summer months were bliss, when the fields were alive with tractors, mowing, turning and bailing as farmers literally made hay when the sun shone.I can still conjure up the sweet smell of freshly cut hay, lugging the balesinto tower formations, feeling the scratch of it against sunburnt arms, which would later be slathered in Calomine lotion, or,there was none, butter.In those days health and safety didn’t seem to be a concern. Sun cream didn’t seem to exist and I remember sitting on the back of the baler as the emerging bale would push me out on to the stubbly mown ground then riding precariously on top of a trailer piled high with swaying bales as they were taken from the field to a shed. One year my father grew corn and had hired an antique thresher for the job. Duffy’s Circus might as well have come to our townland, as farmers from far and wide came to see the spectacle. It was the talk of the area for weeks. But my favourite time of the year was the autumn when I would gather crab apples, damsons and blackberries from the hedgerows so my mother could make gloopy, super-sweet jam for the winter. The only aspect of farming I hated was the annual torture of gathering ‘the praties’. It was cold, back-breaking work – and hazardous too,some clown decided to lob a rotten Kerr’s Pink at your head, or put muck-caked worms down your polo neck. And the winters could be tough. Our farmhouse, heated by one open fire until we got central heating sometime in the s, was always freezing. The only time a second fire was lit in the ‘good room’ was on very special occasions, when I could sit on an antimacasser-adorned sofa and drink in lungfuls of Mr Sheen-scented air, as the ious ‘antiques’ were routinely polished to within an inch of their le. Often I long to be back on the farm to chat with the old boys whose trousers were always clabbered with cow dung and tied with baler twine who endured harsh winters and long, long days, but retained an unbruisable wit. I miss the rituals of the farming year. I miss the pampered cattle and the fresh air. I miss the ease and the contentment. I don’t ever miss gathering spuds!TELL US YOUR YARNS AND WIN A STAY AT LUSTY BEG We have teamed up with Lusty Beg Island Resort to give readers the chance to revitalise after a hectic festive season and check-in to the island resort for a two-night stay with a special seaweed bath treatment in the newly relaunched Island Spa.One lucky reader will win a pair of tickets to enjoy a scrumptious dinner on one night in the Island Restaurant, breakfast on both mornings and a relaxing seaweed bath that can deeply detoxy, hydrate and nourish the skin, hair and body.To be in with a chance to win, simply send us your own farming memories or anecdotes, in no more than , words.

to avoid a hard Irish border which would see Northern Ireland continue to follow some EU rules around tradeno better solution can be found.Mrs Foster is expected to say: “We cannot wish away the fact that the draft withdrawal agreement contains arrangements that are not in Northern Ireland’s long-term economic or strategic interests.“Northern Ireland would remain part of the European Union’s customs code and as things stand we would be sowing the seeds of inevitable economic ergence from our largest market.”Tory Brexiteer Boris Johnson is also expected to address the DUP conference on Saturday.Mrs Foster acknowledged the frustration of many in Northern Ireland’s business community with the pace of negotiations.Her party has prided itself on its relationship with firms, but relations have been strained by their support for the draft UK-EU deal.Mrs Foster has said the DUP may revisit its deal to support the Conservatives in key votes at Westminster.She will tell her annual conference: “I acknowledge the hard work and determined efforts of the Prime Minister to secure an agreement.“She is genuine when she says she wants to see an outcome that does no harm to the Union and the internal market of the United Kingdom.“However, this draft agreement fails her own key commitments.“The Prime Minister has not been able to guarantee an outcome that eliminates the risk

Four weeks later the cash for ash scandal erupted and rapidly led to her removal as first minister.At last year’s party conference, though weakened by an appalling Assembly election result in the wake of the scandal, Mrs Foster was able to use the DUP’s stunning position after the subsequent Westminster election to project an image of her party wielding unparalleled power and influence.The de facto deputy prime minister and the government’s chief whip were present to make speeches, a feat which would have been unthinkable for much of the history of a party which was steeped in anti-establishment ideology.Over the last year, the party has been dogged by crises and embarrassing revelations.In February, the party leadership came to the verge of a deal with Sinn Fein to restore Stormont but couldn’t sell it. That was followed by Ian Paisley’s suspension from Parliament for accepting lavish holidays from a foreign government.And for months the RHI Inquiry has exposed the myth of the DUP as a happy family, exposing feuding, nepotism, alleged drunkenness, incompetence, greed and backbiting.For the second year in a row, Arlene Foster has refused to speak to News Letter readers, declining to do the traditional sit-down interview ahead of the party conference.No reason was given for that decision but there has been internal DUP concern about Mrs Foster’s tone in interviews and her ability to face dficult questions.This year there are still the trappings of the DUP’s powerful position, with Tory big beasts in attendance at the conference.But there is the increasing concern among some unionists that the DUP’s influence with the government is not as substantial as the party boasted.For more than a year the DUP has been explicit that it was prepared to accept almost any form of Brexit so long as it involved Northern Ireland being treated the same as the rest of the UK – what Mrs Foster described as her “blood red line”.And yet the party has been unable to convince the prime minister of sticking to the one red line it outlined, with Theresa May’s Brexit deal setting out the prospect of Northern Ireland erging from the rest of the UK and staying closer to the EU in key areas of regulation.Foster: EU withdrawal text not in NI’s long-term interests Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The party now faces myriad dilemmas with decisions over coming months about whether to bring down the government and risk Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister, whether to replace Arlene Foster as leader, how to respond to the looming RHI Inquiry report and the question of whether it can sell a compromise with Sinn Fein in order to restore Stormont.Many unionists are reassured to see the DUP in the position where it finds itself, recalling how other avowedly unionist prime ministers have been prepared to disregard their views.For those people, the DUP is now a constitutional handbrake. Eventhat handbrake fails over Brexit, it will not necessarily result in electoral punishment for the DUP because in those circumstances those voters are likely to see Northern Ireland’s place as being all the more precarious and therefore see an increased need for a strong unionist voice.But while the DUP may be electorally insulated, the real damage could be to the Union itself, with the combination of Brexit, the exposure of DUP behaviour in government and Northern Ireland’s farcical governance vacuum leading to soft nationalists and some of the constitutionally unaligned becoming increasingly vocal in stating that they are now looking to Dublin for a solution.try catch     .               ..

Peter and his fellow volunteers hand out goodie bags donated by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.The -year-old married father-of-one was part of an eight-person team who travelled to Kolkatato help out at a boys’ home and a school in an impoverished area of India’s third largest city.Explaining how he got involved in the project, he said: “Around  years ago, my mum and dad went out to Kolkata to visit a friend they know who supports a programme that works with homeless children. They both loved it and felt compelled to get involved themselves and help. Every other year they take a team out to help practically and financially and this year I decided to go. “The charityruns many dferent projects, including drug and alcohol rehabilitation centres, two children’s homes, food programmes for homeless street kids and an English-medium school for  impoverished children. “The founder of the school wanted to provide a top quality education for the poorest of children in Kolkata and it is now one of the highest-rated private schools in the area. The criteria for joining the school is strict and designed to ensure the children who get in could not have afforded a private education otherwise. Peter Johnston presented young people at a boys home with rugby kits donated by Carrickfergus Grammar School.“Around  of the children are from the children’s homes and would have been rescued during their early years. All are fed throughout the day and do not leave without a full stomach. “It is truly inspirational to see a school that could easily charge thousands of pounds in tuition fees for the standard of education, delivered to the poorest children in their community for free. “One of their past students went from being homeless and uneducated as a child to recently becoming one of the youngest professors at Darjeeling University at the age of .”A Business, IT and Marketing graduate, Peter’s job in international sales for a generator manufacturing company has seen him visit many dferent countries, including Lebanon, Dubai, Nigeria, Kuwait and Qatar. He has also travelled to several other parts of the world such as Vietnam and Brazil. But he said carrying out voluntary work in Kolkata was “a real eye opener” and an experience that was “truly humbling.”“Our main project was to paint the boys’ home. The home houses  boys aged  -  years old. Most of the boys in the home have come from situations that you can’t even imagine and it is so humbling to see them valued and loved by the charity workers who have given them an opportunity. Many people kindly contributed to this trip and with their money we were able to buy them a TV and a printer for their computer. “During our trip my mum, Ruth, ran training sessions on child counselling whilst others helped out with the Railway Project, which feeds homeless children living on the Kolkata railway, most of whom suffer from drug and alcohol issues from as young as six.”Determined that his work for the charity won’t be limited to his time in India, Peter is now doing his bit to try to secure UK government funding for a much-needed project for vulnerable children.Sam McBride: DUP’s electoral insulation could be a  comfort Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“We are currently in the process of applying for international aid funding through Westminster’s Small Charities Challenge Fund so it was a good opportunity for me to meet with the executive director to begin this process,” he said. “For three years now the charity has been waiting on funding for a project that aims to build a sustainable drop-in centre for the railway children, to provide a shelter, food and classes for those who need them. The centre is also planning to grow vegetables and sell bottled water to contribute to the running costs. “Sadly, many of the major funding bodies for the charity have pulled out of India altogether, which has virtually buried this project. The Westminster funding would bring this back to le again and would provide the help and support that these kids need.”While disappointed to miss his first council meeting, the former Carrickfergus Grammar School pupil stressed that he had committed to taking part in the trip to Kolkata long before he knew he’d be standing in last month’s by-election.It’s not only overseas where Peter is keen to work to improve the lives of vulnerable children and young people. As a an active member and trustee of his local church, Harbour Faith Community, he supports the church’s efforts to “add value to the local community in Carrick.”Peter, who is married to Tory, the daughter of South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan, says his Christian faith and his active role in the church is “a very important part” of his le. “We run lots of dferent projects but in particular we have a group called Carrick Connect that serves the young people of Carrickfergus by offering our building as a drop-in style environment for youths that have been affected by drugs and alcohol.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Plans have now been submitted to construct the homes close to Sprucefield, outside Lisburn. It would also involve a new link road on the M motorway. An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years. Elsewhere, this week a major £m housing development in Larne was awarded outline planning permission. Nuport Developments has been given the early go-ahead for  houses on the -acre site at Ballyboley in the town. The Ballyclare-based developer is now expected to progress to a more detailed plan for the housing scheme.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/may_1.jpg","title":"the brexit draft agreement business reaction","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew The publication of a draft agreement between the Prime Minister and Brussels over the UK’s exit has caused a huge stir among the political institutions. Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
