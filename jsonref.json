Drawing by Michael Viney A torrent of little silvery sprats was spilling in panic out of the sea, chased ashore by mackerel, and people were scooping them up with buckets, gleeful and shin-deep at the very edge of the tide. It’s a childhood memory from Brighton beach, the pebbles hot and summery.Sprattus sprattus is a species of its own, not the young of anything else. It feeds on plankton and in less than five years the female spawns repeatedly, producing up to 14,000 eggs. Shimmering schools of sprat are a basic takeaway in the ocean chain they spend the night, for safety, in the depths. Brighton’s sprats always tasted marvellous fried – a now forgotten flavour. But a project at the Galway Mayo Institute of Technology aims to make a special “west of Ireland gourmet seafood” of this “overlooked and under-utilised resource”.How “overlooked” sprats are depends on who’s talking. Ocean-going Irish trawlers have been invading western and southern bays between October and Christmas – the non-spawning season – for a huge, unregulated catch of sprats, some 30-40 per cent ending up in fishmeal. In a massive increase since 2018, from some 4,700 tonnes to 15.000 tonnes last year, it reached five times the catch levels advised by the Marine Institute. At the beginning, in the 1990s, shoals of sprats in two west Cork bays could sometimes cover “square kilometres”, according to veteran whale-watch skipper Colin Barnes. Shoals rapidly reduced to hectares have now vanished, he says, and the whales now pass without feeding.Research by the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group suggests that humpback whales, on summer migration past Ireland, rely on sprats for 70 per cent of their food. They also feed the bottlenose dolphins of the Shannon estuary, a prime sprat trawling destination. Birdwatch Ireland finds sprats vital to a dozen kinds of seabird breeding in the southwest , such as gannets. All the conservation NGOs (a formidable list, including groups for seals, dolphins and salmon) had joined with local inshore fishers in calls for government control. In 2018, then minister for the marine Michael Creed announced a ban on sprat fishing inside six nautical miles of the coast by trawlers bigger than 18m. This had the support of the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the bulk of more than 900 submissions to the minister’s consultative review. It also allowed a three-year transition period for “adjustment” by the trawler skippers.The judgment in October 2020 found the ban was in breach of fair procedures and had no legal value, lacking proper consultation with trawler owners. ‘Urgent action’A joint letter to the present Minister, Charlie McConalogue, by a coalition of ban supporters, reflected its wide public support and urged him to take “urgent action”. He subsequently failed in attempts to get a stay on the court ruling and continue the ban. An appeal heard in June awaits, as I write, a final ruling.This struggle to find “fair” law in defence of the inshore ecosystem is part of a changing view of the ocean, dismally overdue. Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the State agency for fishery development, once treated small fishermen and their world of half-deckers as a mere stepping-stone to bigger offshore trawlers. Its current strategy document sees the inshore sector as “in a very different space” from that of 20 years ago. Four years of consultation with the fishermen and processors through local groups and the National Inshore Fisheries Forum have, it says, allowed them to “take ownership of the process and the final product”.For inshore fishermen, sprat are now seen as an alternative catch to the lost abundance of skate, ray, plaice and other inshore species. Even native purple sea urchins, once a prolific delicacy, now have to be farmed ashore.Among Ireland’s 1,900 inshore vessels, however, “taking ownership” of concern for local marine ecosystems still seems far from general achievement, and conservation can still seem a discipline brought from outside. The Maritime Area Planning Bill now advancing into law enables an ambitious new network of marine-protected areas around the coast, balanced with the needs of offshore windfarms."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Photograph: Nick BradshawFormer Stormont first minister Peter Robinson has accused the EU of “irrational political prejudice” and warned that it must “go back to the drawing board” over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The ex-DUP leader described reforms to the post-Brexit arrangements outlined by European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic on Wednesday as an “upgrade” but insisted “much more movement will be required” to bring unionists on board.He suggested triggering the contentious Article 16 of the protocol - which allows the EU or UK to unilaterally suspend aspects of its operations if either side considers them to be causing “economic, societal or environmental difficulties” - may be necessary “to achieve that goal”. Mr Robinson also accuses the SDLP, Alliance and Sinn Féin of a “grovelling endorsement” of the EU’s proposed reforms, which would scrap most checks on goods moving between Britain and the North.The de facto Irish Sea border was erected under the protocol, agreed by London and Brussels, to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and protect the EU single market after the UK pulled out of the bloc. “What gets me most is the irrational political prejudice and overbearing haughtiness of the EU, who think that it is a greater priority to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland than between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom of which we are part,” Mr Robinson wrote in his weekly column for The Newsletter. Favoured by nationalistsHe alleged that Mr Sefcovic was only interested in protecting gains from the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement which are favoured by nationalists. The 1998 peace deal was “damaging” and “it is heresy for any unionist, especially with the benefit of hindsight, to praise” it, he wrote. Mr Robinson said the agreement “threw the jail gates open for terrorists to flood out, destroyed the RUC, allowed Sinn Féin into government while republicans held on to their bombs and guns, continued murdering, relentlessly persisted with their criminality, while refusing to support the police or recognise the authority of the courts”.He said he was “unimpressed” by the SDLP, Sinn Féin and the Alliance party offering a “grovelling endorsement of the EU proposals”. “These parties welcomed the protocol in its original form and there would have been no change if it had been left to them,” he wrote. “They are content to maintain the denial of democratic accountability for laws that will be made by the EU and imposed in Northern Ireland. They accept that the EU should be both advocate and judge in its own cause when there is a dispute about trading matters.‘Sleight of hand’“They endorse the constitutional sleight of hand that declares Great Britain to be a ‘third country’ in relation to Northern Ireland trade and they applaud maintaining checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.”Mr Robinson said the EU was also completely ignoring “ the constitutional, legal, and democratic implications of the protocol and seems to think it is only the trading element of the protocol that needs to be considered.”“Even in that narrow perspective they fall short. If the problem was limited to the costly compliance requirements and time-consuming checking of goods within the United Kingdom the answer is the removal of those checks, not a reduction in their number,” he wrote. Reacting to Mr Robinson’s comments about the Belfast Agreement, Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Friday said: “I am surprised at that language but I haven’t heard that sentiment. “I met with all of the political parties last Friday, all of them articulated to me a desire to maintain the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, the Assembly and the Executive to ensure the continuation of political stability.”Mr Martin also defended the latest set of proposals from Mr Sefcovic and the EU, pointing out that Mr Sefcovic had very carefully and very deliberately gone to Northern Ireland to hear from all shades of political opinion there before coming up with his latest proposals.“First of all,Maros Sefcovic went to the North, he met with all the political parties and he met with all of the representatives of business and industry in Northern Ireland and he listened at first hand. I would have met him before he went to the North, his objectives are genuine and sincere in trying to make the protocol work for all of the people of Northern Ireland,” said Mr Martin.Mr Martin said he recalled a conversation with Mr Robinson some years ago when Mr Robinson lamented the fact that Northern Ireland did not have the equivalent of the IDA to attract in foreign investment as the agency was doing in the Republic.“I believe having access to the Single European Market is a huge advantage to jobs and to business and to industry in Northern Ireland and the measures brought forward by the commission this week through Maros Sefcovic really advance that agenda in terms of inward investment into the North but also allowing businesses in the North to grow through exports to the European Union market,” said Mr Martin.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland vulnerable after delta surge says nolan as 2 180 new covid cases reported","story":"The recent rise in Covid-19 cases has led to uncertainty over whether the Government should proceed with plans to ease the majority of remaining pandemic restrictions from next Friday.  Photograph: Nick BradshawThe balance between high levels of vaccination and high levels of Covid-19 in the community has “tipped in the wrong direction” in the last 10 days, Prof Philip Nolan has stated.The surge in cases, with 2,180 reported on Saturday, the most since January, has put the full reopening of society next Friday in doubt.It has also prompted deputy chief medical officer Ronan Glynn to advise workers to continue to work from home if they can during the winter.Prof Nolan, the chairman of Nphet’s Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group since March 2020, has sought to explain why cases are so high at present, though 92 per cent of the adult population is fully vaccinated.Ireland was at a disadvantage because it was hit by the Delta wave of the virus during the summer, he said. It drove daily cases from 300 to 1,800 per day during June and August, at a time when most of the population under 50 was not vaccinated.The vaccination programme for young adults, aged between 16 and 30, saw a temporary decrease in Covid-19 numbers.Prof Nolan continued: “However, this left us in a vulnerable position, with high levels of infection, and that delicate balance between very high levels of vaccine protection on the one hand, and increasing levels of social contact and risk of transmission on the other.Autumn surgeProf Nolan said the autumn surge in cases was not as a result of the opening of schools.“The incidence in schoolchildren was decreasing, and less than that in August prior to the reopening of schools despite higher levels of testing,” he tweeted.There were “high but stable levels of infection last month” but it was a balancing act between the protection offered by vaccines and increased social contact creating opportunities for the virus to spread.Nphet found evidence from the ESRI social activity measure and mobility data that mobility and social contact are increasing, and adherence to infection prevention measures decreasing.A shift from outdoors to indoors may be playing a role, Prof Nolan said. Other seasonal factors might at play, but “their contribution at this point in time appears to be small”.The average age at which people are being admitted to hospital with Covid-19 increased rapidly once young people were vaccinated in September, he said.Prior to that some young people were admitted to hospital with Covid-19 but usually only for short stays.“We can’t know what will happen over the coming weeks: this could prove to be a transient, or renewed and sustained growth in infections. We do know from past experience that when cases rise, people become more cautious and limit the spread.‘Rumble on’A further 2,180 Covid-19 cases have been reported on Saturday as a senior health official said high infection numbers were likely to continue in Ireland for the foreseeable future.HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said the State was unlikely to see “wild surges” in infections but that he expected they would continue to “rumble on” at a high level.The latest Department of Health figures show 406 people with Covid-19 are being treated in hospital (down seven on Friday’s total) and that 71 are in intensive care (down two).Currently Ireland has a 14-day incidence rate of 410 cases per 100,000 people and the recent rise in cases has led to uncertainty over whether the Government should proceed with plans to ease the majority of remaining pandemic restrictions from next Friday.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) is set to meet on Monday to draw up advice for the Cabinet to consider before it makes a decision.Alongside an outright pause on the planned easing up, it is understood options to be considered will include the retention of distancing measures in indoor settings like bars and restaurants across winter, allied to some increases in capacity in theatres and cinemas. A structured reopening of still-closed sectors such as night clubs may be favoured, again with retention of vaccination certs.It was suggested that this was an argument being used by anti-vaccine groups to encourage others not to get vaccinated.UntrueDr Henry said it was untrue to suggest that the vaccinations were not having a positive impact in the fight against the disease. He said there were almost 1,500 deaths from Covid-19 in January but that “we have a fraction of that now”.“Similarly with admissions to ITU (intensive treatment unit), the link between cases and harms has been severely weakened, if not completely broken, and that is down to the vaccination programme.”Cases are currently running at an average of some 1,500 a day, he said, and without the vaccine hospitals would be “over-run” with admissions as a result of Covid-19.Dr Henry admitted that Covid-19 cases are “uncomfortably high” at present. He suggested that the rise could be attributed to greater levels of social interaction as society opens up.He said he would be happy for night clubs to open provided entry was reserved for those with certs showing they had been vaccinated or had recently recovered from the disease.“This will ultimately be a Government decision. It doesn’t have to be a binary decision. We have to make decisions based on the best evidence we have at that point in time,” he said.Not translating“At this point in time, we are seeing a high level of cases, but they are not translating as badly as they used to in terms of hospitalisation. Nevertheless we still have people out there who are unvaccinated and are vulnerable.”On Covid-19 testing, he said Ireland had an oversupply of PCR tests and this lessened the need for rapid antigen testing, which is being used in universities and childcare settings but not more widely in society.He also said that there is “a big interest” in the booster vaccine programme. He anticipated that the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) will decide on Monday whether or not to expand the booster programme to the over 60s.Government sources anticipate that Niac will give the go ahead for people aged over 60 to receive a booster dose, as well as frontline healthcare workers.Dr Henry added: “I expect if there is a decision we will hear about it soon enough.”Northern Ireland’s Department of Health on Saturday reported four deaths of patients who had previously tested positive for Covid-19 and a further 1,218 cases of the disease.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"irish priest remembers david amess as a man who took his faith seriously","story":"An Irish priest who became a close friend of murdered Conservative MP Sir David Amess has described him as a man who was always looking out for other people.Fr Pat Browne officiated at the wedding of Mr Amess and his wife, Julia, in 1983, in Westminster Cathedral, and was also the celebrant at the baptism of their five children.He was due to say Mass at the wedding of Mr Amess’s daughter, Katie, before Christmas, in the chapel at the Palace of Westminster.Fr Browne has been a priest in the Westminster diocese for the last 47 years. He got news that an MP had been stabbed to death as he was preparing to officiate at a wedding Mass.“I saw a headline at 1.55pm and I hadn’t time to read it or follow through to see how badly he was stabbed. At that stage he wasn’t dead. It was only when the wedding was over that I rang an MP who told me he had died.”Mr Amess was fatally stabbed while conducting a constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea, in Essex, on Friday. The chief suspect in his murder is a British national of Somali heritage, and Scotland Yard said, in a statement overnight,\u0026nbspthat its inquiries “revealed a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism”.Duty priestFr Browne, originally from Ratoath, Co Meath, is the parish priest at Our Lady of the Apostles, in Pimlico, central London. In 2009 he became the first officially Roman Catholic duty priest at the UK house of parliament since the Reformation.In that capacity, he got to know Mr Amess well. Fr Browne said the MP for Southend West was somebody of a strong Christian faith who was consistent in his pro-life views – he opposed the death penalty as much as he opposed abortion.“He was very conscious of his faith and tried to live by it. He was a nice man in every way. He lived life to the full. He looked out for all forms of life. He was always looking out for the underdog,” Fr Browne added.His concern for all forms of life included his opposition to fox hunting, which he was adamantly against – a stance that did not make him popular in sections of the Conservative Party. “He was always his own man,” Fr Browne said.In 1988 he, as one of the few Catholic MPs in the House of Commons at the time, brought Mother Teresa to see the then British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher.He was the founder of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Holy See, which lobbied to ensure that proposals to merge the British embassy to the Vatican with its embassy in Italy did not come to fruition.Mr Amess was from a working-class Catholic background in the East End of London. His inherited his Catholicism from his mother, Maud.“He was always arguing in the chamber that Southend should be recognised as a city. He was always having a laugh at his own expense, but he was a very serious man.“He really took to heart people’s concerns and worked for everybody in his community. He was very concerned about his colleagues. If he heard one was sick, he would come and visit them. He was always looking out for people.”On Monday the multidenominational chapel in Westminster will be open all day for people to come and remember him. A large memorial service and funeral will take place later on.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"locals to seek judicial review of monstrous plan for o devaney gardens","story":"A public meeting took place on Saturday in response to plans to build more than 1,000 apartments in blocks of up to 14 storeys at O’Devaney Gardens in Dublin 7. Photograph: Tom HonanA public meeting took place on Saturday in response to plans to build more than 1,000 apartments in blocks of up to 14 storeys at O’Devaney Gardens in Dublin 7. Photograph: Tom HonanA €400 million redevelopment of the O’Devaney Gardens in Dublin 7 to include more than 1,000 apartments and one 14-storey and two 12-storey tower blocks has been condemned as “monstrous” by local residents, who have vowed to seek a judicial review to stop the project. The scheme proposed by developer Richard Barrett’s Bartra is made up of 10 apartment blocks with 1,047 units on the site near Stoneybatter and the Phoenix Park. The project, given the green light by An Bord Pleanála last month, is around 40 per cent larger than the original schemes backed by Dublin City Council in 2019 and is significantly different to the low-rise project initially envisioned. Under the proposals there will be 30 per cent social housing, 20 per cent affordable housing with the remaining 50 per cent to be sold on the private market. A condition of the planning permission means that the units are restricted to inidual purchasers or those qualifying for cost rental or social housing.Around 100 local residents gathered on Saturday for a meeting in a small park, which will be in the shadow of the development if it goes ahead, to hear from legal and housing experts, locals and public representatives.Brian O’Connor, chairman of the Stoneybatter-O’Devaney Action Group, told the meeting that the community was “not against development”. “We all want to see the O’Devaney Garden site developed, it has been a particularly unlucky site to have remained undeveloped for so long. It’s such a vibrant part of the city and with such potential, we can do much better than the proposal that is imminent,” he said. The site has been earmarked for redevelopment for close to two decades. However, the previous plans collapsed, most notably when developer Bernard McNamara pulled out of a public private partnership scheme as the economy tanked in 2008.Mr O’Connor said the scheme agreed in 2019 contained 724 units while the current one had more than 1,000. He questioned whether the area could cope with such a large development with the potential for an extra 3,000 people. “This area cannot take the monstrous scale of this scheme, one that does not remotely reflect or respect the existing historic architectural context of cottages, terraces, military squares, avenues, monuments or parks. This is the unique character of this area,” he said. He added that the revised application when it appeared in May “was sudden and shocking”. “The public were allowed only five weeks to lodge an observation on a huge and complex scheme most were seeing for the first time.”He said the concerns of the local community had effectively been ignored in the planning process. Lorcan Sirr, a TU Dublin academic and housing policy analyst, told the meeting that the development exemplified “much of what has gone wrong with planning, particularly since about 2015”. He said that from an architectural perspective the development was “incredibly inappropriate” and it was on a scale which was “materially breaching Dublin City’s development plan”. Labour councillor Joe Costello, the only public representative to address the gathering, said the approval for the scheme in 2019 was given in the context of the city development plan, which favoured low rise developments. “There was no mention of 14 storey or 10 storey, high-rise developments.”Mr Costello said that once agreement had been reached between the developer and Dublin City Council “the expectation was that this was going to be a lowrise development, in tune with the low-rise nature and character of the houses in the surrounding area”.He said the density of the proposed development had climbed dramatically and now appeared to be “in direct breach of the agreement that was made and signed between the city council and Bartra”. Solicitor Fred Logue outlined the legal avenues the action group could take including seeking a judicial review of the development. He told the meeting that his legal firm was looking into around 40 different developments with around 25 judicial reviews either pending or completed.

Photograph: AFP via GettyMatt Hancock said the United Nations had written to him to explain that a technicality in its rules meant it could not offer him a special representative role as planned.The former UK health secretary had been due to take up an unpaid post in the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) to assist countries on the continent to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.But, after a UN spokesman was quoted saying the job was “not being taken forward”, Mr Hancock released a statement to clarify why the offer had been withdrawn.“The UN have written to me to explain that a technical UN rule has subsequently come to light which states that sitting members of parliament cannot also be UN special representatives.“Since I am committed to continuing to serve as MP for West Suffolk, this means I cannot take up the position.“I look forward to supporting the UN ECA in their mission in whatever way I can in my parliamentary role.”There are previous instances of sitting MPs taking up UN posts, with former prime minister Gordon Brown appointed a special envoy in 2012.ResignedMr Hancock, who resigned from the UK cabinet in June after admitting he broke coronavirus restrictions during relations with an aide, announced on Tuesday he had been offered the position with the global organisation.“ECA has advised him of the matter.”Reacting to the announcement that Mr Hancock would no longer be taking up the post, Nick Dearden, director of campaign group Global Justice Now, said: “It is right for the UN to reconsider this appointment.“If he’d done that when he was in government, tens of millions more people could already have been vaccinated across the continent.“The last thing the African continent needs is a failed British politician.“This isn’t the 19th century.”Damning reportThe original announcement was criticised as it came on the same day a damning report from MPs was published on how errors and delays by the UK Government and scientific advisers cost lives during the pandemic.In a letter posted on Twitter by Mr Hancock on Tuesday, the under secretary-general of the UN, Vera Songwe had originally said that the West Suffolk MP’s “success” in handling the UK’s pandemic response was a testament to the strengths he would bring to the role.After making the initial announcement on social media, Mr Hancock was congratulated by a host of ministers, including UK foreign secretary Liz Truss and UK culture secretary Nadine Dorries.Mr Hancock’s time as health secretary was cut short four months ago after leaked CCTV footage showed him kissing an aide, in breach of the social distancing rules he had helped establish. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"cant go forcing children self isolate","story":"I have gained a newfound respect for the Oxford-AstraZeneca nerds after my Covid-addled eight-year-old breathed directly into my face on Monday to prove she had brushed her teeth before bedtime.Well, you could hardly blame the kid for forgetting she has a highly infectious disease spread by airborne transmission since she has had no symptoms whatsoever.Thanks to the miracles worked by those men and women in white coats, my double-jabbed husband and I have stayed negative despite spending the past two weeks living in a den of plague.First our eldest got it. At 12 going on 21, she happily ensconced herself in her room with an Amazon Fire TV Stick and a stash of Pot Noodles and we barely saw her for the obligatory 10 days. Indeed, we hardly noticed the difference between her being in self-isolation and what used to be known as “family time”.Being the sort of people who separate their recycling, we diligently followed the Government (and school) advice to lateral flow-test our other two children daily, as well as ourselves. Lo and behold our youngest, Little Miss Mentadent, got the dreaded double line less than a week later, swiftly followed by our 11-year-old son.We did try to separate the blighters, honest, but how the hell are you supposed to self-isolate an eight year old? Since coronavirus is now ripping through secondary schools, what’s to say they didn’t get it from an asymptomatic classmate or a child whose parents don’t separate their recycling? We will never know.What is certain, however, is that they have now lost another month of school between them, despite there being nothing seriously wrong with any of them. The eldest had a mild sore throat, the boy has had a bit of a cough – but under normal circumstances they would have been sent on their way with an Ultrabalm pocket pack, and possibly some Tunes if I was feeling really generous. (As a doctor’s daughter I practically had to be decapitated to miss a day of school – and even then my father would probably have applied Steri-Strips while insisting “you absolutely don’t need stitches”.)The sheer ridiculousness of having to homeschool three otherwise healthy children could not have been better demonstrated than by the repeated calls I had to field from NHS T and T (Test and trace? Track and trace? Don’t test me on it, I’ve lost track) – even though, again, being responsible citizens, we had already told anyone who needed to know.As well as discovering that “T and T” cannot actually test, track or trace school contacts (eh?), I was also informed that “for safeguarding reasons”, I could not report all of my children’s “other” close contacts at the same time, even though they solely comprised my husband and me (and possibly the cat, although “close” is probably overstating it). Apparently, I could only do it separately. Three times. For a minimum of 25 minutes per call. “For safeguarding reasons”, I refused.How much is this service still costing the taxpayer? And why are we still testing asymptomatic children at all? My husband and I are far from the only parents not to have caught coronavirus from their infected offspring.According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, the percentage of people currently testing positive is highest in secondary school pupils at around 7 per cent but just 1.2 per cent in those aged 35 to 49. The infection rate in the over-50s is half that, at 0.6 per cent.So even though Covid-19 is seemingly spreading like wildfire through the Snapchat generation – old Facebooker farts like us aren’t catching it anywhere near the same rate thanks to the success of the vaccination rollout. I accept that the Year 7 to 11-ers may be overrepresented in the charts because we are testing them more – but that in itself begs the question: why?Why, when children are at far less risk of being hospitalised and dying from coronavirus, are we treating them like we are still in peak pandemic mode? Adults aren’t being obliged to take two lateral flow tests a week, so why are children?All of this also raises the bigger question of what the point of continued mass testing really is when the only route back to normality is to treat Covid as we would any other endemic disease.The revelation that 43,000 people are thought to have been given incorrect negative PCR results by an NHS-sanctioned laboratory in Wolverhampton rather suggests that the whole system is not fit for purpose.What we can say for certain is that almost two years on from the March 2020 lockdown, children continue to carry the burden of a disease that doesn’t even affect them – when nearly 80 per cent of the population over 12 have been double-jabbed. It makes no sense.Children obviously shouldn’t be in school if they are actually ill. But rather than keeping healthy children at home, we should be entering a phase where we accept that Covid is here to stay, that unvaccinated children are predominantly going to catch and spread it but that it’s okay because the success of the vaccine rollout means we have protected not just the vulnerable and the immuno-suppressed but the overwhelming majority of teachers and parents.Even the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health thinks mass testing in schools should end, arguing that it is causing unnecessary chaos, spreading needless fear and adversely affecting children’s mental health.Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, has rightly argued that mass testing in schools is “utterly pointless” and “just another example of treating children as second class citizens”. A number of health experts have also quite reasonably asked what evidence there is to show that this sledgehammer to crack a nut approach is actually stopping transmission and infection.This week, Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, highlighted another problem with the status quo – ongoing unexplained absence in schools.With one in 40 pupils missing school due to Covid last week, up from around one in 80 at the start of the school term, Mr Zahawi has warned headteachers that extended coronavirus absences must be curbed. Clearly recognising that a lack of schooling has a more significant negative impact on children than Covid itself, he said attending school was “a national priority” and essential for children’s “well-being and long-term development”.Well, if that is the case, minister, why are you actively continuing to keep children away from the classroom?The long-term knock-on effect of all this absenteeism should not be overlooked.According to the Centre for Social Justice think tank, nearly 100,000 children failed to return to schools full-time after they reopened. These pupils remain unaccounted for. They are the lost children of lockdown. I shudder to think how many of them have become vulnerable to local gangs or dangerous home environments.Meanwhile, the pandemic has caused a surge of kids to vanish from the school roll. Officials do not know how many pupils are home-schooled, or why. No register is kept. But the best guess is 75,000 pupils, a figure that surged by almost 40 per cent last year.So we have at least 175,000 children who can’t be tracked or traced, which rather makes a mockery of every single infuriating phone call I have received this week. More from NewsSir David Amess received \u0026#39upsetting\u0026#39 threat in days before fatal attackParliament calls in new security firm after mounting complaints from MPsDominic Raab: I’ll overhaul the Human Rights Act to stop Strasbourg dictating to usFace-to-face meetings with the public must continue – even after murders of Sir David Amess and Jo CoxPriest wanting to give Sir David Amess the last rites was denied entry to crime sceneNHS hospitals will be given guidance on preserving single sex wardsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"could west do deal putin keep lights winter","story":"The message was delivered with the kind of knowing shrug that only a long and successful career in the KGB can really train you for. Speaking at an energy conference in Moscow on Wednesday, alongside the chief executives of Exxon Mobil, BP, and Total, the Russian President Vladimir Putin was quick to deny that his country was using its control of Europe’s gas supplies to advance his nation’s own interests. “We’re not using any weapons,” he said, a trademark steely glint in his eye, dismissing talk of geo-strategic blackmail as “politically motivated blather”. On the contrary, he was, the President insisted, making sure gas supplies were stepped up. If there were any problems, they were all the fault of someone else. Russia was here to help its neighbours.Well, up to a point. There is no question that Europe is gripped by an energy crisis as severe as any it has faced since the 1970s, and that the UK is right in the thick of it. Prices are soaring. Energy firms are going bust. There is talk of factory closures, three day weeks, and rolling blackouts. In the background, and whatever his denials, Putin, a political leader well versed in the dark arts of manipulation and great power politics, has levers at his disposal and won’t hesitate to pull them. When he denies using gas supplies as a weapon, one thing is for certain. That is precisely what he is doing. They are as much of an instrument of war as his country’s tanks, mortars and missiles ever were. And they are pointed at precisely the same place – the heart of the West.In truth, we are in the middle of a ‘gas shock’ that is likely to be as profound as the ‘oil shock’ that reshaped the world in the 1970s. For the Government, as for governments across the continent, the questions are about to come thick and fast. How did we get into this mess? How can we get out of it? And perhaps most of all, what price are we willing to pay to keep our lights turned on, our homes and public buildings warm and factories open?The UK and Europe’s energy crisis has been years in the making. Over the course of the past year, wholesale gas prices have risen more than fivefold. On some days of frantic trading, prices have been soaring by 20 or 30 per cent in a single session, a sign of a market under severe stress. The reason? The switch to cleaner, renewable energy, while welcome in itself, has meant that demand for gas, viewed by policy-makers as a reliable, not-too-dirty transitional fuel, has been steadily increasing. The massive size of stimulus programmes around the world as we recover from the Covid pandemic has translated into vast and unexpected increases in demand. A lack of wind has meant that renewable energy has not been as plentiful as expected, and gas is being used as a back-up. Meanwhile, China, along with much of the developing world, has been absorbing huge  quantities of gas to fuel its constantly expanding industrial machine. The development of liquified natural gas (LNG) transported around the world on huge container ships has created a global market very similar to oil. Most of the demand comes from Asia, with Europe largely an afterthought, but the trouble with being an afterthought is you don’t have much security of supply. And in the background, Russia, the only country with sufficient reserves to make a real difference to the market, is widely believed to have been holding back supplies, both to maximise its leverage with the West, and to remind everyone just how much the continent still relies on plentiful supplies of its energy. The result? A supply crunch, with soaring prices and bottlenecks throughout the system.  Britain has been hit especially hard. We have run down our reserves of gas to a mere four-five days of supply, far less than most of our continental rivals. “Pathetic really for a nation as important as the UK,” said Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire industrialist, tersely in a television interview this week. When we closed down storage facilities we still had back-up supplies from the North Sea we could buy extra gas relatively easily on the world market whenever we needed it and we had rising alternative energy sources that could be ramped up if necessary. At the same time, we ran down nuclear capacity, while France was still ramping it up, and our commitment to combating climate change made it virtually impossible to reopen coal mines. The British state has been caught out as hopelessly unprepared as this crisis deepens.  Granted, there is some bad luck in the process. No one could have predicted so many factors all coming together to put pressure on supplies at the same time, but a crisis is always at least in part bad luck. The point is to be prepared for the worst, not simply to hope for the best. The UK failed to do that. “Everything will depend on the weather,” says Laurent Ruseckas, executive director of analyst firm IHS Markit. “When it is really cold Russia needs a lot more gas, and that impacts on its ability to supply Europe.”There are plenty of big producers of gas. The US, Norway, and Qatar are all major exporters. But it is Russia that holds a quarter of the world’s entire proven supply and a network of pipelines that makes it the crucial player. In private, ministers and officials concede that since Russia is the world’s largest exporter, the amount it puts onto the market affects the global wholesale price, and some already believe that that is being turned into political leverage. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told The  last week that energy was being used as a “weapon” by foreign states, although he was careful not to point the finger directly at the Kremlin, while the Tory frontbencher Lord Agnew of Oulton this week went further, arguing outright that soaring energy costs were the result of a “geopolitical move” by Russia to put pressure on Europe. We are less vulnerable to that than some of our neighbours. Unlike mainland Europe, Britain does not rely on Russia for physical supplies of gas. The vast majority in the UK comes from British territorial waters, with the rest from reliable import partners such as Norway, Qatar and other nations in the Middle East, while less than 3 per cent comes from Russia. “Very little physical Russian gas comes to the UK because it makes no sense to transport these molecules all the way from Russia to the UK in the absence of certainty provided by medium or long-term contracts,” Katja Yafimava, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told The . Officials agree. “We are not dependent on Russian oil or gas whatsoever. There is no concern about security of supply. This is a question of high global gas prices,” a senior government source told The . “Europe gets about 41 per cent of its gas from Russia. They are massively exposed to the threat of leverage from Moscow. The UK is fortunate enough to have sovereign access to gas reserves in the North Sea in the way that many European countries don’t, so we are far more insulated than our European partners.”Officials may be breezily optimistic, but that is not the whole story. While the UK imports relatively little gas from Russia right now, the latter’s decisions to a large extent determine the global price, and that in turn determines whether Britain can buy the supplies it needs from anywhere. Even worse, right now, there is very little that anyone can do to get out of the situation. “On the supply side, there is not much Europe can do,” argues Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel Institute. How bad will it get? “We expect the price to rise as a consequence of tight supply,’’ says Tom Marzec-Manser of the energy consultancy ICIS. “And that will be the main way that the market copes with the issue. We have already seen some industrial shutdowns in Europe as prices rise and we could see more of that. Once that happens, demand will start to fall.” And yet if that doesn’t work, then no one really knows for sure right now what will happen. It is easy to start sketching out doomsday scenarios. We could see shutdowns, with heating and gas stoves turned off pensioners could die of the cold, while the rest of us put on extra coats, and heat up our dinner in the microwave, assuming the electricity network is still running. In reality, it probably won’t get to that point. As a first option, the Government could start restricting supply to industrial users, which accounts for up to 20 per cent of overall demand. Industries such as chemicals, paper, packaging and building materials, all big energy users, could see factories put on three-day weeks. After that, schools and offices could also be put on a three-day week to save energy, and so could retailers (a shopping mall takes a lot of heating in winter), and then possibly closed completely. That would take a huge amount of pressure off the system. After that, there could be the kind of staggered blackouts we saw in the 1970s, designed to eke out meagre supplies through the winter. It wouldn’t be great. But it would mean the heating would keep running for most families. But this would still be a catastrophe for the government. The last Prime Minister to put the country on a three-day week amid an energy crisis was the man who took us into the European Union, Sir Edward Heath. Historians might see a certain irony in the symmetry of the one who took us out of the EU, Boris Johnson, repeating that humiliation. But few people would find it funny and it would destroy any reputation of basic competence. In these circumstances, could Johnson be tempted to ever strike a deal with Putin to keep the lights on? It is already not hard to detect a certain thawing in Britain’s relations with Russia. Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea Football Club, has been seen at the team’s games again, after an 18-month gap amid visa issues. We have heard less and less about the outrageous poisonings on British soil. Is the ground being softened up for an ‘arrangement’, to put it politely, that sees Russia ship extra gas to the UK? “Everyone talks about the potential political lever,” says Ruseckas. “But the idea is preposterous. Who do you sit down and talk to, and what do you demand? It is just not how things work.” Well, perhaps. But if it came to not having a choice, having exhausted our supplies and not being in a fit state of preparedness what would a deal look like?  As it happens, the UK might have a few cards up its sleeve. We could quietly back off condemnation for Russia’s military and strategic adventures in the Crimea and Ukraine. Regulators have been trying to wash suspicious Russian money out of the City for years, with ‘unexplained wealth orders’, with Russian companies quietly blocked from listing their shares on the London market, and with the banks forced to be a lot more circumspect about accepting even the largest deposits. A Russian economy that is booming on the back of soaring energy prices – the Moscow stock market, not very surprisingly, hit all-time highs this week – will need a major financial centre to process all the money it is raking in. London would be the obvious candidate, if regulators could be persuaded to back off a little. That would be worth something to the enormously wealthy Putin and even more to his cronies. Even leaving aside the concessions that sound like a sub-plot from a John Le Carré novel, there is still plenty Britain could do to persuade the Russians to sell us more gas. Russia has very few trade deals around the world, and Britain has backed off from negotiating one, in part because of Russia’s poor reputation, but mainly because we have been too busy working on post-Brexit deals with Australia, Japan and the US. But Russia would desperately like one, if only to help integrate its economy into the Western world it could set a precedent for other deals. What  would really convince Russia would be long-term gas supply contracts, with the fossil fuel guaranteed a place among the mix of energy resources for years to come. Some of Gazprom’s gas arrives in the UK as LNG, and there are capacities at British gas terminals for additional supply, while some of it comes as piped gas, which travels in pipelines from the continent. Gazprom, the largest Russian energy supplier, typically signs take-or-pay long-term contracts with its customers in Europe, meaning that the buyer commits to purchase a certain amount of gas every year even if it realises later that it doesn’t need that much, while Russia offers a stable price less dependent on market fluctuations.“If the UK buyers were to sign medium to long-term contracts with Russia, that would provide them with some insulation against extreme price volatility,” says Yafimava. It would be a risky gambit. “No one is going to want to sign one of those deals right at the top of the market,” cautions one energy market insider. “But if you were willing to commit to four or five years, the Russian suppliers would probably find you some gas even though it would be expensive.” Put it all together, and Britain might be able to put together a package that is attractive enough to persuade Russia to sell us just enough gas to keep the country running. Of course, we are still a long way from that point. Ministers are not even considering it right now. It would leave us dangerously exposed and the UK is determined to make a success of the Cop26 climate summit later this month. “Russia’s main priority will be Russian consumers,” says Marzec-Manser. “As they meet that, and as they refill their own storage, will they increase supply onto the global spot market? We may start to see that as we head into November and that will help the market calm down.” That will certainly be a relief to everyone. The weather may well be mild throughout the winter, which, as Kwasi Kwarteng told business leaders this week, would ease demand. Extra supply may turn up if factories in Europe close simply because energy prices are ridiculously high. A recession in China, by no means impossible with its property market wobbling, would reduce demand even further. Something may turn up at the last minute, as it often does. If it doesn’t, however, the British economy will be in real trouble, and the Government with it.  Additional reporting by Lucy Fisher and Nataliya VasilyevaMore from NewsSir David Amess received \u0026#39upsetting\u0026#39 threat in days before fatal attackParliament calls in new security firm after mounting complaints from MPsDominic Raab: I’ll overhaul the Human Rights Act to stop Strasbourg dictating to usFace-to-face meetings with the public must continue – even after murders of Sir David Amess and Jo CoxPriest wanting to give Sir David Amess the last rites was denied entry to crime sceneNHS hospitals will be given guidance on preserving single sex wardsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sir david amess pictures distinguished life southend west mp","story":"Sir David Amess, the Conservative MP for Southend West, has died aged 69 after he was stabbed to death during a constituency surgeryDominic Raab: I’ll overhaul the Human Rights Act to stop Strasbourg dictating to usComment: Face-to-face meetings with the public must continue – even after murders of Sir David Amess and Jo CoxSir David Amess received \u0026#39upsetting\u0026#39 threat in days before fatal attackParliament calls in new security firm after mounting complaints from MPsPriest wanting to give Sir David Amess the last rites was denied entry to crime sceneNHS hospitals will be given guidance on preserving single sex wardsComment: My friend David\u0026#39s faith-filled life showed the true meaning of kindnessSir David Amess murder suspect was flagged to counter-extremism officialsWe will not be cowed, insists Priti Patel, as MPs press ahead with face-to-face surgeriesPrince Andrew will argue use of \u0026#39royalty\u0026#39 in Epstein settlement makes lawsuit invalidComment: We are already seeing the disastrous consequences of Britain\u0026#39s baby bustSocial media companies ‘must do more’ to protect MPs from online hateKiller launched horrifying assault that sent MP’s aides screaming, then sat down beside his victimJoe Biden must get tougher on Iran to secure Israel-Saudi Arabia normalisation, says Mike PompeoChilean president faces ignominy of becoming first leader to be impeached following \u0026#39Pandora Papers\u0026#39 scandal10 facts you never knew about Guy FawkesBonfire Night 2021: the story of Guy Fawkes, gunpowder, treason and plotHalloween 2021: trick-or-treating, fancy dress costumes and why we carve pumpkins on October 31Winter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?When do the clocks go back, and why do we do it?October\u0026#39s Hunter\u0026#39s Moon: when it will peak in the UK and full moon dates for 2021Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"already seeing disastrous consequences britains baby bust","story":"Jaw-dropping official figures released this week revealed a worrying trend: the level of childbearing in the UK has dropped to barely 1.5 children per woman, little over half of what it was in the early 1960s.Don\u0027t expect births to bounce back soon. The effects of Covid, given as a reason for people to delay having children, are yet to filter into the statistics and besides, it’s been almost fifty years since women in the UK were bearing children at or above replacement level. The longer the baby bust goes on, the greater will be the consequences. Indeed, some of those consequences are already making themselves felt.First, there was the petrol shortage. It was not caused by a lack of petrol but by a lack of people. Pay people more in one sector and, if you are generally short of workers, the gaps will show up in another sector. This week alone we have heard about shortages of care workers, midwives (despite the small number of births) and butchers. When I joined the workplace back in the early 1980s, there were almost twice as many people of the age to start work as there were of an age to retire. Now there are almost as many people of an age to leave the workforce as of an age to join it.That gives rise to the second consequence immigration. The vast inflow of people over the past two decades has been the only way to meet our voracious appetite for labour without producing the people ourselves. But this is not a sustainable strategy for the future. When it comes to small family sizes, most rich countries (and some not-so-rich ones) have been in lockstep with us. The number of Poles born in the early 2000s, for example, is half the number that was born in the early 1950s. So expect fewer people queuing up to come here from countries with high productivity workers, whether we favour their coming or not.The third consequence of our persistently low birth rate is an ageing population. Having an older population does have some advantages older people are less likely to commit crime – in London, for example, the oldest boroughs are the ones with the lowest murder rate – and countries with older populations are less likely to go to war. But an ageing population also has some negative ramifications.Older people are less likely to take a risk with their capital and more likely to look for government guarantees for their investment. The state not only can but must borrow and spend that capital if we are to avoid a great demand hole at the heart of our economy.Additionally, older people are more demanding of state services. Around half of the extra per capita spend on NHS in the last decade has been required just to reflect the needs of an older population. The state pension meanwhile will make increasing demands on the public purse even if it only goes up with inflation.The fact that we are living longer is of course good news, but so many of our difficulties stem from the fact that while our lives have got longer, we have failed to bear enough children. Governments can tweak policy, but what is really required is a much less apocalyptic view of the future and a much more positive approach to the joys of parenting.Dr Paul Morland is the author of The Human Tide: How Population Shaped the Modern WorldMore from NewsSir David Amess received \u0026#39upsetting\u0026#39 threat in days before fatal attackParliament calls in new security firm after mounting complaints from MPsDominic Raab: I’ll overhaul the Human Rights Act to stop Strasbourg dictating to usFace-to-face meetings with the public must continue – even after murders of Sir David Amess and Jo CoxPriest wanting to give Sir David Amess the last rites was denied entry to crime sceneNHS hospitals will be given guidance on preserving single sex wardsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"art childish graffiti redressing queen victoria disraeli statues","story":"The monument to Queen Victoria in Liverpool has cast an imposing figure on the city\u0027s Derby Square since it was erected in 1906.However a new art project, in which the statue was adorned with a brightly coloured cotton dress, has raised eyebrows in the art world, condemned by some as “childish graffiti” and no more artistic than students putting traffic cones on sculptures.Statues Redressed sees contemporary artists invited to “creatively reimagine some of Liverpool’s most iconic statues” by dressing the existing works or creating new art around them.Thomas Brock’s 1904 statue of William Gladstone has been wrapped in a flag representing African countries by Larry Achiampong, as a response to the fact that the former prime minister’s “family fortune came from plantations and slavery”.Meanwhile, the designer Daniel Lismore has draped Charles Bell Birch’s 1883 statue of Benjamin Disraeli with a “Pride-themed Empress of India dress”, pictured below, as a commentary on the Victorian statesman’s “reputation as a flamboyant dresser and a dandy who wrote love letters to men”.The Queen Victoria monument itself was given a cotton and hessian dress by Karen Arthur \u0026amp Laurence Westgaph. According to the project\u0027s website, the material was chosen as during Victoria\u0027s reign, cotton was crucial to Liverpool\u0027s economic success, despite being picked by enslaved people in the United States until 1860. The piece is said to reflect Liverpool’s complicity with slavery, and how Queen Victoria and Britain were beneficiaries of that as recently as 150 years ago.For some though, the interventions are a step too far.Michael Sandle, a leading sculptor and Senior Royal Academician, believes the project shows a “total lack of respect” for the original statues, their artists and the iniduals commemorated.“This is all wrapped up with tearing down sculptures and political correctness… Appalling decadence, he told The .The fact that the Liverpool interventions are temporary does not placate him: “It’s like students putting traffic cones on sculptures… Anybody who criticises this will be seen as fuddy-duddies or kill-joys. They won’t understand our outrage at the disrespect. These are bloody people who can’t draw.”Tom Murphy’s 1997 statue of Liverpool’s legendary football manager Bill Shankly at the Anfield Stadium has been “redressed by designer and LUFC fan Nadia Atique by draping “a cape fit for a superhero” on the statue.But Murphy himself is unimpressed: “I don’t think enough thought went into it. I just felt it was nothing,” he said. Edward Young, who co-wrote an acclaimed biography of Disraeli, said: “I do think they have missed the point. Disraeli would not have said he was gay. He was mainly in love with himself. It’s a bit of a stretch to say he was a warrior for Pride. He certainly wasn’t. It’s us translating our own labels on the past.Julian Spalding, a former director of galleries and museums in Sheffield, Manchester and Glasgow, dismissed it as “childish graffiti given contemporary credibility by trivial wokery”.Michael Daley, director of ArtWatch UK, which campaigns to protect the integrity of works of art and architecture, said: “This is a culturally wrong-headed and politically cheapskate stunt. Architectural and sculptural civic heritage should be respected for what it is and not treated as a playground for parasitical art world exhibitionism and politically-illiterate nihilism.”While John Larson, who headed sculpture conservation at the V\u0026ampA, said: “I find it disappointing when other people seek to impose their viewpoint or taste on a sculpture, in effect rewriting history.”For Karen Arthur, one of the artists behind the new interpretation of the Queen Victoria monument, the response is water off a duck\u0027s back.She said: “Critics are entitled to their opinion… I’m just thrilled that we’re talking about statues that usually people walk past and don’t take a blind bit of notice of.” Liverpool was chosen because of its rich history, with the highest number of statues in the UK outside of London.The city council gave permission for the project as it owns most of the statues. Robin Kemp, its head of creative for Culture Liverpool, said: “I would, on behalf of the artists, take exception to the idea that what they’ve done creatively is tantamount to putting a traffic cone on… It absolutely is art.”For the organisers, the cultural service of Liverpool city council and Sky Arts, the unveiling of each statue was an opportunity to look again, think again, and question how we feel about the public art that surrounds us.A “Statues Redressed documentary will air on Oct 18 on Sky Arts and in it, former National Gallery director Neil MacGregor, says: “Statues are about telling stories and what I think is happening in Liverpool is a new way to engage the citizen in the conversation.More from NewsSir David Amess received \u0026#39upsetting\u0026#39 threat in days before fatal attackParliament calls in new security firm after mounting complaints from MPsDominic Raab: I’ll overhaul the Human Rights Act to stop Strasbourg dictating to usFace-to-face meetings with the public must continue – even after murders of Sir David Amess and Jo CoxPriest wanting to give Sir David Amess the last rites was denied entry to crime sceneNHS hospitals will be given guidance on preserving single sex wardsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"climate change cult now owes religion rationality","story":"Everybody seems to accept, after recent events, that scientific advice can lead to disastrous government policy. It is now widely believed that misjudgements on the part of official scientific advisers led to the wrong decisions being made in the early stages of the pandemic. Dutifully following what ministers insisted on calling The Science was, it turns out, not such a great idea after all.Before this incident slips away into the annals of historic political scandals, we should ask what precisely went wrong – because the governments of the world are currently facing another set of far-reaching decisions prompted by scientific advice, which involve even greater potential for catastrophe.That particular scientists, at a particular moment, made a mistaken strategic calculation in an unprecedented health crisis is not shocking, or even terribly surprising. It does not dishonour those iniduals whose advice they sincerely believed to be well-founded. Nor does it discredit the authority of science itself. What happened – and could possibly be about to happen again – arose from a fundamental misunderstanding of what science is, and the degree to which its findings can be regarded as inviolable.The clue is in the way that government ministers described the scientific opinion to which they were adhering so assiduously. Matt Hancock in one memorable moment actually said that “with science on our side” we would inevitably defeat Covid. What was notable about this fatuous statement was not just the idea that “science” (as opposed to inidual scientists) can ever be on anybody’s side, but its startling resemblance to a testament of religious belief.Just replace the word “science” in that phrase with the word “God”. Our trust in the omnipotence and benevolent protection of scientific authority was put beyond doubt or criticism. “Science” (always referred to as one inisible thing) was the fount of all certainty and therefore to raise objections to its pronouncements was irresponsible and, by implication, wicked. Only with hindsight, as the Prime Minister is often heard to say, can we see the mistaken calculations that were made and the consequences that arose from them.But the essential mistake was made by ministers who treated science as if it were revealed truth rather than what it actually is: a mode of inquiry that relies on endless questioning, competing theories, exhaustive argument, the examination of contradictory evidence, and, above all, the toleration of disagreement, in order to progress. (To the extent that the scientific advisers were complicit in the Government’s naive view of their disciplines, they must be seen as culpable.)All of this is critical to the way that the issue of climate change is being treated by governments and global institutions. The discourse around the danger that it represents and what should be done about it is now dominated by language which can only be described as apocalyptic in the true Biblical sense of the word.Let me say from the start that I am not qualified to make scientific judgements about the empirical facts of this matter. (Nor, of course, are some of the prominent exponents of the most extreme version of the climate campaign: Greta Thunberg does not have a degree in any scientific subject and famously withdrew from formal education to pursue her public mission.) It is perfectly possible, so far as I know, that the most cataclysmic predictions and the inevitability of the worst prognoses are objectively correct.And yet there is something about this movement that is so suspiciously imitative of an extreme religious cult that it is very hard to see how it could be compatible with the spirit of scientific endeavour. Climate campaigning, at least in its most well-publicised form, embodies everything that one would expect to see in a movement of fanatical fundamentalist fervour: the concept of original sin (industrialisation) that requires an acceptance of universal guilt which can only be expiated through self-denial and penance (sacrificing personal prosperity and freedoms).The political establishments of the grown-up developed world are now promulgating accusations and vengeful warnings delivered by child saints of the terrible world-destroying punishments to come if their cries of woe are not heeded. All of this is somehow incongruous: a bizarre melding of modern media and the Middle Ages.There is something absurdly childlike and unscientific about the anthropomorphising of the planet which is inevitably referred to as if it were a sentient being, a loving parent (Mother Earth?) which is in danger of being destroyed by our ungrateful, selfish behaviour – even though the spread of industrial progress and mass prosperity around the world could be seen as the opposite of selfishness.Alongside this beatification of the planet as a living presence which must be protected from our rapaciousness, goes an absurdly  sentimental picture of Nature. The natural world is now routinely depicted as a realm of infinite peaceful coexistence and benign ersity whose denizens are threatened only by the cruel exploitation of human activity. As anyone who has learnt anything about the brutal imperatives of evolution will know, the natural world is more of a Hobbesian war of all against all for survival than a Garden of Eden.Of course human beings have been – and still are – guilty of horrific predations but such activity is coming under ever greater surveillance and control by the conscientious forces that only human beings can muster. And the husbandry of the natural world by organised society has certainly helped to protect life forms that would otherwise have been lost in the ruthless natural struggle for dominance.More than anything, it is this presumption that humanity must be the source of all evil that makes the climate campaign seem so bizarrely unscientific. It is a moral crusade with echoes of an age of unreason – when modern science, from Galileo onwards, has seen itself as the essence of rational thinking and the opponent of dogmatism. Perhaps the decline of proper religious belief, which offered at least a possibility of forgiveness and reconciliation with past error, left a vacuum that could only be filled by self-loathing.More from NewsSir David Amess received \u0026#39upsetting\u0026#39 threat in days before fatal attackParliament calls in new security firm after mounting complaints from MPsDominic Raab: I’ll overhaul the Human Rights Act to stop Strasbourg dictating to usFace-to-face meetings with the public must continue – even after murders of Sir David Amess and Jo CoxPriest wanting to give Sir David Amess the last rites was denied entry to crime sceneNHS hospitals will be given guidance on preserving single sex wardsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"made last film says sir michael caine","story":"He\u0027s played cads, soldiers, spies and criminals - and even acted alongside The Muppets as Ebenezer Scrooge.But Sir Michael Caine has said offers of work have dried up as leading roles are hard to come by at the age of 88.The Italian Job actor said Best Sellers, which co-stars US actress Aubrey Plaza, has turned out to be my last part, after a career ning almost 70 years.Sir Michael said he had not received any other offers of work for the past couple of years, adding: Nobody\u0027s been making any movies that I want to do, but also I\u0027m 88. There\u0027s not exactly scripts pouring out with a leading man who\u0027s 88.Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, he said: I haven\u0027t worked for two years, I have a spine problem which means I can\u0027t walk very well.I also wrote a couple of books which were published and were successful.

They almost visibly glazed over. “Thing is,” said the husband after a long pause, “we’ve both lived our entire adult life here. What happens in the UK is so remote, we don’t even think about it.”Their plan on Hong Kong’s becoming fully part of China in 2047, his wife added, was “to bury our heads in the sand”.But being a subject of the People’s Republic has come much more suddenly than anyone expected so much so that a rising number of “repat” Brits are now streaming back to the UK. The old, fiercely democratic Hong Kong is dying at pace and Covid has proved to be the last straw: borders are closed, schools often are too and the creep of political interference now dominates.When I Zoomed them last week, my friends asked to remain anonymous in this article, already nervous about who might be snooping.“Covid has given Beijing the excuse to turn Hongkongers into obedient citizens,” says another expat still there. “So if there’s one case of a kid testing positive, the entire school is closed down and your children can literally be taken away from you to quarantine.”At the same time: “Subway trains are packed as ever. It makes no sense, but it’s designed to wear us down, to show the rule of law is gone. You can even go to jail for disrespecting the Chinese flag now.”Some of these “repats” have never lived in Britain as adults many, according to an employee at an agency sourcing schools for returners, have settled in East Anglia – even though they have no connection with the area. Perhaps it’s a subconscious need to be as far east as possible.My friends, although still in Hong Kong, have sent their children to boarding schools in Britain, bought a house in the West Country and are now debating when they will come back to what they once rather reluctantly called home. Many of their friends are in the same position, reassessing the situation week by week.For the growing tribe of Hong Kong repats, “home” is more like a new foreign posting. Lucy Barrett, who after 24 years between Hong Kong and Japan has now settled in Cambridge with her husband Andy, likens the experience to TV show Mork and Mindy. “We feel like Mork, the Martian who comes to Earth,” she says. “It’s little things that often make you feel you have lived in another world. We got fined when we first came back for driving in a bus lane, not knowing what they are... And we’re desperate for someone to explain what Strictly Come Dancing is supposed to be. Neither of us gets it.”The pair left when John Major was prime minister living in Hong Kong made home news feel “like a movie playing out somewhere else”, says Andy. “Things like 911 would happen, or Iraq, but you weren’t part of it.”Wildly different political systems play into this too. In the UK there is much more involvement from voters on decisions that are made, whereas there: “You don’t get a vote, or not a meaningful one, so if there’s a new security law, there’s nothing you can do about it,” says Andrew Ford, who has moved to Cambridge from Hong Kong with his wife, Helen. Politics “wasn’t as impassioned in Hong Kong, not so aggressive and full of hatred and vitriol.”Still, there are benefits to being back, he says. Namely the weather: “Hong Kong has the world’s worst. There’s the NHS. The breadth of education for children of different needs. Country pubs. No communication problems. The price and availability of groceries...”“Also,” says Helen, “you can buy clothes that fit you, instead of being thrown out of shops and told you’re too big and fat.”Building up a social network once home often proves tricky, though. Hong Kong has long resembled a giant cruise ship, where everyone lives close by and where babysitters often live in taxis are cheap and plentiful and the famed MTR railway is spotlessly clean, safe and efficient. Yet long lockdowns – earlier this year police officers were dispatched to neighbourhoods, permitted to forcibly enter homes and fine anyone refusing a Covid test HK$5,000 – and raging street protests have largely put paid to those fun times.What previously drove social life in Hong Kong “is that everyone can go out any night without notice”, Andrew explains. “You’d meet people at a party or a work event and immediately arrange to go out for a drink... You could make good, deep friendships extremely quickly.” Meanwhile in the UK, socialising is “quite a commitment and you need to be sure it’s a good friend you are investing in. Also here people are very entrenched in their circle, whereas there, everyone is transitory and on the lookout for new people.”More money helps fund the fun in Hong Kong too the average expat household income is up to 50 per cent higher than in Britain, according to some estimates, with many expats still amusingly given a “hardship allowance” from companies after making the move.Emma Andrews-Linnitt was struck by the many limiting factors of socialising back home, and quickly started a local coffee club for people new to her area near Ipswich when she returned. “If you’ve lived overseas for 20 years, you know that if you don’t make an effort you’ll never have any friends.” She is less forthcoming with sharing where she has been for the last 20 years. “You’re given a rather wide berth, sometimes,” she says. “I tend to say just that we’re new here.”“I always feel if I talk about Hong Kong and Japan, people will just think I’m being flash or making myself out to be special,” Helen agrees. “I’ve had to stop myself doing that.”  International schools in Hong Kong were once another attraction for expats. Pupils tended to be socially assured, racially colour blind and Mandarin-speaking – increasingly a meal ticket in the global jobs market.But months of Covid closures – and no refunds for fees – saw the shine wear off that, too. Acclimatising to schools at least has been straightforward, repat parents report, mostly thanks to the internet. “International kids tend to be more adaptable, anyway,” says Andrews-Linnitt. “Living overseas gives them social skills... and with social media, they are used to keeping in contact with anyone anywhere.”“The kids have been like ducks to water,” agrees my friend over Zoom from Hong Kong. “They already live in a global village, linked by Instagram and all that, like the same music, the same celebrities.”Some remain nostalgic for the good Hong Kong days they miss the vibrancy and noise of the streets, the beautiful country walks, tropical beaches, amazing food – and the gems of the Far East being a couple of hours’ flight away. Having changed so much in such a short time, though, Britain has provided a soft landing.As Andrew puts simply, “All in all, I’m glad to be back.”More from NewsSir David Amess received \u0026#39upsetting\u0026#39 threat in days before fatal attackParliament calls in new security firm after mounting complaints from MPsDominic Raab: I’ll overhaul the Human Rights Act to stop Strasbourg dictating to usFace-to-face meetings with the public must continue – even after murders of Sir David Amess and Jo CoxPriest wanting to give Sir David Amess the last rites was denied entry to crime sceneNHS hospitals will be given guidance on preserving single sex wardsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"140000 families day having universal","story":", families a day having Universal Credit cut as food and energy costs soarBoris Johnson cruelly axed a £-a-week uplt during the Tory conference - and by Sunday .million families will have already suffered the cut for the first time\" content\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES n _JS.jpg\" width\"\" \"\" The loss of the UC uplt will throw , claimants into povertyImage: AntonioGuillemByNigel NelsonPolitical Editor:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsUp to , low income households are being added each day to the list of families forced to choose between heating and eating. Boris Johnson ’s cruel cancelling of the Universal Credit uplt during the Tory Party conference means that by Sunday, .million working families have lost £ a week which will rise to .million by next month.The figures have been calculated by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation as the poverty research charity tries to plot the increased pressure food banks and debt advisers will face this Winter. JobCentre adviser Stephen, father of a teenage son, is not allowed to tell his workless clients he is also on benefits but he has just £ a week to live on now UC has been cut. He said: “That money was for school bus fares, books and other educational necessities. Now, it’s that or cutting back on food.” That is why campaigning footballer Marcus Rashford and the Food Foundation he works with are demanding free schools meals this Autumn for every child up to age  in households receiving UC.  He said: “No child should be going to bed hungry. Whatever your feeling, opinion, or judgement, food poverty is never the child’s fault.” And Food Foundation boss Anna Taylor added: “A hot school lunch should provide vital sustenance for vulnerable children. “Too many children are missing out because their families can’t afford it.” The loss of the UC uplt will throw , claimants into poverty including , children, according to the JRF. Since the pandemic began , more children registered for free school meals as one in three parents lost income through redundancy and furlough. Yet despite the spike in demand the effects of Covid mean school canteens are struggling to provide hot lunches with % of kids aged - saying they are not getting them. But Leeds University research shows fewer than two per cent of packed lunches meet nutritional standards.  A study by University College London’s Institute of Education last week showed many schools in deprived areas trying to plug the gap by helping children out with extra food and clothes. UCL’s Professor Gemma Moss said: “That families are so reliant on schools highlights fundamental weaknesses in our current welfare system that urgently need repair.” And Paul Whiteman of the National Association of Head Teachers added: “The government’s record on child poverty is shameful. “Austerity is not just a temporary phase for some families. it is a day to day reality. “Tragically, children are well aware of their family’s money troubles. They are often embarrassed and ashamed.” As the standard UC payment drops back from £. a month to £. families are facing paying out an extra £ a month in higher food and energy costs, according to insurer Royal London. Citizens Advice warns that a third of UC claimants will now end up in average debt of £ a month and charity Turnus says one in four will be unable to afford rent or mortgage payments. Turnus boss Thomas Lawson said: “The £ per week cut was already going to leave many families struggling. “The sudden surge in energy prices could spell disaster and plunge thousands more people into financial insecurity or even poverty.” Up to  million families will see gas and electric bills increase £ a year to £, - while four million pre-payment meter customers face a £ rise to £, a year. Citizens Advice chief Dame Clare Moriarty said: “Cutting UC as we head into a very tough winter is a recipe for disaster. “If the government is serious about levelling up it must change course.” The Health Foundation predicts the UC cut and higher bills will lead to a mental health crisis for those worst affected. The Foundation’s Jo Bibby said: “The pandemic is not over andwe are to avoid long-term scars it is vital we maintain support on which so many families rely.” A Government spokesperson said: “We’ve always been clear that the uplt to Universal Credit was temporary. It was designed to help claimants through the economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic, and it has done so.“Universal Credit will continue to provide vital support for those both in and out of work and it’s right that the Government should focus on our Plan for Jobs, supporting people back into work and supporting those already employed to progress and earn more.” Comment MORE ON Marcus RashfordBoris JohnsonEnergy billsMental healthPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Last year there were  building deaths - a quarter of all workplace fatalities. A new report shows tiredness is putting the safety and even the lives of .million workers at risk with nearly one in three working up to  hours. Accidents and injury rates are % higher than in other trades and the retirement age lower because of the backbreaking work. And the Construction Industry Trading Board warns that is causing a shortage of high skilled jobs as workers leave because of long hours before they are . There are now , vacancies and , more builders will be needed by  to meet demand for extra housing. Oscar Cooper, a  year old construction worker from Sheffield said: “I can work for four days at a higher level than I could for five days. Would you support a four-day week  Join the debate in the comments below.  “On a Friday you’re just watching the clock, desperate to go home, trying to chip off early. You’re knackered. It’s inefficient and it’s dangerous.” The report says as a result of the hours builders suffer from sleeplessness, lack of attention and fatigue related to overwork. It adds that accidents are also more likely to occur at the end of long shts. On-site building labourers have a % higher incidence of musculoskeletal disorder and more than eight in ten suffer mental illness including stress, depression, anxiety and trauma-related PTSD. Renovation and extensions firm Orocco in Scotland moved to a four day week on the same pay and hours in April and it has been so successful it will now be permanent. Joe Ryle of the  Day Week Campaign which compiled the study said: “Rested workers are more productive, make fewer mistakes and quality of workmanship improves. “A four-day week would help to retain existing workers. Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions boss Ian Waddell added: “This compelling report spells out why a shorter working week would be good for workers, employers, the environment, the NHS and our economy. “If shorter working time can be shown to be beneficial and achievable without any loss of productivity then it is surely achievable in any industry.” Comment MORE ON Employment rights\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Not because, like many MPs, he wanted to secure a debate, but because he genuinely liked a gossip and a chat with my staff. If he wasn’t talking about his family – he was a very proud husband and father – he would be talking about his love of animals or the delights of his constituency, Southend West. But he also wanted to know what was going on in the lives of my colleagues, worryingone of them wasn’t there. That was David – a man who found a connection with everyone. Only four hours after David died, I had time to reflect on the vulnerability of MPs at their surgeries as I did my own in Chorley.  For more than two hours, constituents poured in to talk to me about cowboy builders, housing problems, mental health services – and evenI knew where a cheerleading group could find new premises. But would I want that to end in the wake of the deaths of two of my colleagues, David on Friday, and Jo Cox in   No. Surely being available to people is the cornerstone of our democracy  After Jo was murdered, MPs were offered a suite of new security measures. However, we now need to take stock and review whether those measures are adequate. We are working at pace with the Home Office and the police to identy options. Most MPs are like David and Jo – good, decent people who work hard. If anything positive is to come out of this latest tragedy it is that the quality of political discourse has to change. The conversation has to be based on respect.

He was a good one. Well-liked, passionate, engaged. Not just with the business of Westminster but with his constituency as well. He did important work, vital work. But by far his most important roles were where. He was devoted to his animals, his friends – but above all, his family. We’ll remember his work in Parliament but his greatest legacy will be his love for his children and his pride in being a husband and a father. MPs are public figures, open to scrutiny, criticism, sometimes scorn. That’s always been the way but in recent years it has taken an ugly form.  The Brexit debate raised temperatures, the language in Parliament and beyond has become more cutting, personal. But these are people with friends and family. They are shaken by the ferocity, the vile nature of the threats. The tragic death of Jo Cox was a warning that their safety was in jeopardy. Now another MP has died, another family shattered. In coming days the truth about Sir David’s death will emerge. We will hear about his killer’s twisted ideology, his wicked justication for this senseless crime.

The police, so quick to respond on Friday, will build their case and this killer will meet justice. For a family so torn by loss, that will offer nothing but a small comfort. There is nothing but small comfort for them now. But however hard, they should hold on and remember Sir David with pride.

But his warm spirit and refusal to climb the greasy pole endeared him to MPs left and right. Heres what you need to know about his le storyDavid Amess, centre, during a charity pancake race outside Parliament Image: Justin Ng   AvalonByDan BloomOnline Political EditorBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  Oct | comments An arch-Thatcherite who opposed abortion and gay marriage and campaigned for Brexit, Sir David Amess was not a natural ally of the left.But his murder aged  has prompted an outpouring of grief from MPs on all sides of politics, who remember his warm manner and devotion to his constituents. In his  years as an MP - a job he wanted since the age of  - he never served as a minister, instead putting his time into campaign issues and his Essex seat. First as MP for Basildon from  to  and then for Southend West, Sir David forged campaigning alliances with MPs from other parties. Ahead of his time on key issues despite being a self-confessed “dinosaur”, he campaigned on animal rights in the s, fuel poverty in the s and more recently the plight of people with endometriosis. His violent death has prompted questions about whether MPs should continue face-to-face surgeries - but Sir David’s answer would have been firm. In his book Ayes  Ears: A Survivoraposs Guide to Westminster - published last November - he bemoaned the fact increasing attacks on MPs had spoilt the great British tradition of meeting face-to-face. The book gives a fascinating insight into the le of a man who was ultra-traditional but loved a publicity stunt a career MP but resisted the greasy pole. He arrived to Parliament on horseback to campaign against cruel tethering. Knighted in , he dressed up in a suit of armour astride a horse for celebrations at a school in his constituency organised by the Knights of Middle England. He also won a cult following after repeatedly speaking about his mother at Prime Minister’s Questions, and his incessant campaign for Southend to be named a city. The MP was born in  in east London with no fridge, phone or car, instead making do with an outside toilet and a tin bath hanging on the outside wall. His mother took him to a speech therapist for two-and-a-half years to help him pronounce “st” and “th” - treatment he says was essential to his future career.  At his grammar school he stood in mock elections for his own ‘Revolutionist Party’, pledging to abolish homework and set a national minimum pocket money allowance. “I got to a point where I found myself standing at the top of a fire escape in the playground addressing a large proportion of the school,” he wrote. The soapbox spirit would not be lost. In election campaigns he rode an open-top bus bedecked with a Union flag and sang his own song: “If you want to be true blue, and to air your points of view, Then David Amess is the only man for you”.He joined the Tories aged  after concluding the local Labour Party was responsible for “neglected” roads and “shabby” housing - and never looked back. He said Tony Blair has “blood on his hands” over the “dreadful deceit” in going to war in Iraq - while heaping praise on Margaret Thatcher, who he personally delivered flowers when she claimed the Tory leadership.“She changed the Conservative Party, our country and the world for the better,” he proclaimed in his book. Sir David, who branded himself a “self-confessed dinosaur”, defended old-style Commons sittings until am on the grounds they brought MPs closer together, commended the lost art of filibustering and lamented the move to televise the Commons in . He also decried the coverage of the expenses scandal, saying it has “destroyed” Parliament’s reputation and asking: “What good has come of it all ” But he won praise for his unflinching devotion to his constituents.Ed Holmes, who worked with the MP, told on Twitter how it “couldn’t have bothered him less” that staff forgot to reply to then-PM David Cameron. By comparison, when an invitation to the Leigh Duck Race went missing “nothing was more important. We spent the entire afternoon turning the office upside down trying to find it.” He added: “When he heard someone he knew in the constituency was seriously ill, he would call everyone he could think of. “I remember listening to him late into the evening on the phone to some of the most senior medics in the land- nagging, cajoling, pleading for them to intervene.” Sir David’s book highlights the importance of his good doorstep campaign, for many years run by now-MP Mark Francois - who Sir David nicknamed “Little Hitler”. Sir David wrote how at every social event, he would try to glad-hand every person in the room - never regarding his area as a “safe seat”.These tactics shot to prominence in the  general election, when his early victory in Basildon marked the beginning of a surprise win for then-PM John Major. He wrote in his memoir: “When I am lowered into my grave, because I intend to be buried and not cremated, I will probably only be remembered,indeed I am, for the  election campaign.” He was fooled by Channel ’s Brass Eye into condemning a fake drug named “cake” after the death of Leah Betts in his constituency. To this day he did not forgive the show, writing in his book: “How could you make a mockery of such a serious issue ” Sir David was less than friendly to the media, blasting the “naivety” of MPs who were convinced by journalists to share secrets. He suggested parts of the media “are almost wholly responsible” for inciting “dangerous and vitriolic abuse” against MPs. “It seems that more and more consistently, some members of the press go after politicians personally rather than properly critiquing their policy and ideology,” he wrote.  “They have a lot to answer for and must share some responsibility for the anger directed towards MPs which can end in such tragic circumstances. “While it is easy to say that this is all part of the job, does it really have to be ” Sir David was also waspish about some MPs in his book, portraying a few as “plain stupid” and others as career climbers. But he had praise for those as wide-ranging as Tony Benn to Enoch Powell, who he called “a great patriot”, “putting aside the Rivers of Blood Speech”. And as a colleague, he was remembered for his warmth - including by former Labour MP Paula Sherrf, who he helped through a diagnosis with cancer. “He was the epitome of a gentleman, he was quite old-fashioned, he was very respectful and so chivalrous,” she told the Mirror. “I’m very partisan and I suppose in some ways I tried to resist liking him so much because, ‘Oh, he was a Tory’. But you couldn’t help it – you couldn’t help but love him, he was absolutely infectious.” A committed Brexiteer, devout Catholic and great animal lover, he fought for “pro-le” and animal welfare issues. He was responsible for introducing the Protection Against Cruel Tethering Act in . He also campaigned to stop the testing of domestic products on animals, tackled the illegal wildle trade and fought for an end to puppy farming, according to his website. He opposed the culling of badgers and was one of the few Tory MPs in favour of a fox-hunting ban. In his most recent Commons intervention, on September , he called for a debate on “animal welfare generally, cruelty to animals and the welfare of farmyard animals” to mark World Animal Day on October . He was a patron of the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation and won the Dods Animal Welfare and Environment Award in  for his work on the issue. Channel ’s Countdown mathematician Rachel Riley said Sir David had supported her mother Celia’s work with the Essex Horse and Pony Protection Society. The charity said it was shocked and saddened by the loss of the “local MP and animal advocate”. Last month Sir David told how he was putting his three-year-old French bulldog Vivienne up for the annual Westminster Dog of the Year Show. Marking the “dark and shocking day” yesterday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “Informed by his faith, David had a profound sense of duty, that I witnessed first-hand in Parliament.“His Catholicism was central to his political le and he was highly respected across Parliament, within the church and in the Christian community.” Boris Johnson added: The reason people are so shocked and sad is above all he was one of the kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics.He also had an outstanding record of passing laws to help the most vulnerable.

That is the overwhelming verdict of his grieving constituents who one by one had turned to the politician in their hour of need. A former homeless couple, an elderly war heroine and a woman denied fertility treatment are among the many to have benefited from the slain MP’s unstinting desire to offer a hand. And today, in every corner of the Sir David’s constituency, normal folk lined up to heap praise on the member of Parliament who was never too busy to listen. One told how he helped one of the few British women to see active service in Germany during World War II obtain her war medals  years on.  Samantha McDonald, , contacted the MP five years ago after learning the elderly war heroine had been demobbed without ever receiving her promised and deserved accolades. Samantha said: “David got straight onto the local military representative for the British legion. “They worked together with armed forces to contact whoever they needed to, to get the medals. She received them within three months.  “He went out of his way to make it happen. She was over the moon.” The pensioner Sir David helped is now understood to be more than  years old and is living in a care home. Another woman revealed the MP had given her a chance to become a mother after he intervened in a fertility treatment battle with the NHS.  She wrote online: “Sir David stepped in at the most devastating time in my le. “This man changed my future forever. “I now have the chance to be a mum.” Volunteers at Saint Vincent’s Centre are considering naming their allotment after Sir David, who visited their premises just a fortnight ago. Former homeless couple Darren Bailey and Emma Hayter recalled how he took time to listen.  Darren, , told the MP he had spent two months living in a tent in Southend last winter, but had managed to gain support to find housing through the Saint Vincent de Paul Society, backed by Sir David. He said: “I told him how it had been really scary being on my own, and at times I didn’t want to be here any more as I had no purpose.  “He was a great listener. It really helped to have someone of his level encourage me and take the time to hear my story.” Emma, , who became homeless after a relationship broke down, but now lives with Darren in Southend, said Sir David inspired them to continue working towards “a positive future”. The charity’s director Dan Cauchi, , told how the MP stepped helped him get his pension sorted.  He added: “He was an amazing man. I bawled when I heard what happened to him.” The animal-loving MP previously backed the Sunday Mirror’s campaign to end cruel trophy hunting after we exposed how tourists could book holidays dedicated to killing animals. One local, Karla Syrett, said he would often stop to pet his constituents’ dogs. The -year-old was one of dozens to pay tribute outside the Belfairs Methodist Church where Sir David was attacked.  She wept as she laid flowers at the scene and told the Sunday Mirror: “He used to stop and stroke my shih tzu, Duke. “I talked to him about loads of stuff. He told me he was lucky to have such a nice family. “My husband worked on the paint section in Homebase and David used to chat when he came in to buy decorating stuff. He was such a lovely guy.”  Members or the Muslim community also left flowers. Ruhul Shamsuddim said: “For him to have his le cut short like this is so distressing. He was so kind to our community. He was always smiling.” Audrey Martin described her MP as “an absolute gentleman” who “dedicated his whole le to his constituents”. And proud socialist Bee Middlemast-Neal remembered him fondly, despite their political dferences.  She said: “On two occasions he successfully intervened on my behalf, when I had problems with the Department of Work and Pensions and Appeals and Tribunals service.” Abigail Mkhize remembered how the MP helped her with her Employment and Support Allowance benefit problems. She said: “Six years ago I was having chemotherapy and, as I was working as an agency nurse, I had problems with getting the help with ESA, so I went and saw him. “He said, ‘This is not right, you’ve been here for so long and you don’t deserve this – I will sort it out.’ And he did.” Ms Mkhize added: “He was the father of all nations, that’s how we can describe him. “Whether you were black, white, irrespective of where you come from, he gave that love, affection, kindness, caring.” Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON David AmessPoliticsSunday Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jo Bamford, son of JCB boss Lord Bamford, has set himself up in the hydrogen fuel industry – which will be big business at next month’s COP climate change conference in Glasgow. The self-styled “green entrepreneur” bought collapsed bus manufacturer Wrightbus out of administration in  and set up his own Bamford Bus Company. The firm has since landed a share of £million-worth of contracts from government bodies to supply hydrogen buses. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng announced in March that Wrightbus had been awarded an £.million grant to develop new hydrogen technology. And Mr Bamford has been pressing for another £million of taxpayers’ cash to finance a ,-strong fleet of hydrogen buses produced by firms like his. Askedhe’d personally lobbied Mr Johnson, Mr Bamford said last year: “Of course I speak to people in the Government but I haven’t spoken to Boris. He’s the Prime Minister – he’s way above my pay grade.” While there is no suggestion of improper conduct, Tom Brake, director of the Unlock Democracy campaign group, told the Sunday Mirror: “As long as donors are allowed to gt huge amounts of cash to MPs and political parties, and MPs can switch seamlessly between being the lucky recipient of a donation or a paid consultancy role and a ministerial position, questions will be asked.  “Until a cap on donations is introduced – Unlock Democracy is calling for £, per year – there is always going to be doubt about whether grants or contracts were won fair and square or whether cash for access and influence came into play.” Lord Bamford and his family have handed at least £million in cash and gts to the Conservatives since  – with son Jo also giving £, since . His donations include gts to constituencies of several MPs now in ministerial jobs, including George Freeman, the new Energy Secretary. A year ago, Mr Freeman entered into a contract to offer “strategic advice” to another of Mr Bamford’s firms – Ryze Hydrogen, which invests in facilities that make the fuel cells to power buses. The contract was scrapped and payments ed after Mr Freeman was reported for a breach of the ministerial code for failing to inform a Parliamentary watchdog. Fellow Tory Julian Smith, the former Chief Whip, is a £,-a-year adviser for Ryze. And a new £m hydrogen production facility is set to open up a stone’s throw from the COP conference – with Ryze as a major partner.  The Government’s Hydrogen Strategy predicts the industry will be worth £billion to the economy by . Last year Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was “very, very keen that we push hydrogen”. According to industry magazine Passenger Transport, that came after “sustained lobbying” from Mr Bamford, While the businessman has thrown his lot into green investments, his digger mogul father still has a fleet of aircraft. And the PM has come under fire for using helicopters and jets lent to him by Lord Bamford for campaign visits. Before May’s local elections and the Hartlepool by-election, Mr Johnson is understood to have used a Gulfstream  business jet to fly from Farnborough, Hants, to Wales and the North East. The same month the PM used a Bamford-registered chopper on a -minute flight from London to Wolverhampton – saving just over an hour compared to taking the train.A spokesman for Wrightbus said: There has been widespread cross-party support for hydrogen buses at both national and local level as the UK pushes for net zero, with the likes of London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Labouraposs Shadow Bus Minister Sam Tarry arguing the case.He added: Wrightbus was bought out of administration in  and has since grown from  employees to ,. It is the global leader in hydrogen transport and will continue to invest across the UK, creating skilled jobs, boosting the supply chain and helping tackle climate change. A Conservative Party spokesperson said: “Government policy is in no way influenced by the donations the Party receives – they are entirely separate. “Donations to the Conservative Party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law. “Fundraising is a legitimate part of the democratic process. The alternative is more taxpayer-funding of political campaigning, which would mean less money for frontline services like schools, police and hospitals.” Comment MORE ON Nadhim ZahawiAndrew GrfithsGeorge FreemanTom BrakeBoris JohnsonGrant ShappsConservative PartyClimate changePrivate jetsBritish economyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A note from cousins Moira and Pat left near the church where the -year-old was stabbed to death also read: “Can’t believe this has actually ­happened. Will always love you.” It came as it emerged Sir David had admitted his family “paid a big price” for his career in a clip filmed a decade before he died doing the job he loved. He made the comments in an amateur documentary filmed by then sixth-former Alex Bright for an A-level project in . Generously giving his time to the youngster’s film, Sir David revealed the “impact on one’s private le” of is “very, very tough indeed.”  The MP for Southend West in Essex, who was first elected in , said: “All I will say is, my family has paid a big price for me being a member of Parliament, that bears no doubt.” Sir David was stabbed multiple times at his constituency surgery on Friday and died at the scene. Last night, a -year-old British man believed to be of Somalian heritage, who was arrested at the scene, remained in police custody as officers searched two addresses in London. Counter-terrorism officials are examining possible links to jihadism.  The intelligence services also believe he may have been a “lone wolf” with no links to any major terrorist groups. Alex, who went on to work closely with Sir David as a councillor, was struck by the MP’s comments as he unearthed the clip exclusively for the Sunday People. “That quote really stood out – looking back on what has just happened, it’s evident this was true,” Alex said. “He was kind enough to let me interview him and talk about the role of an MP, what’s demanded of an MP and what’s expected of an MP. He really cared. This feels so surreal, like a nightmare. Sir David was such a nice and gentle person, you can’t fathom why anyone would do this.” In another part of the film, titled Are MPs Worth their Salary , Sir David observes: “I could have earned a great deal more money, had a private le, without what being a member of parliament entails. I’m not asking for any sympathy though, because it’s up to you whether you want to run for office.” PR professional Richard Hillgrove shared a Zoom call with Sir David just three minutes before he was stabbed. He said the MP had been “firing on all cylinders, full of buzz” as they discussed the Children’s Parliament, where Richard’s -year-old daughter Lola had been matched with Sir David. Their call ended at .pm, so Sir David could host his surgery at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea. At .pm, he was attacked Richard “was absolutely horried” when he heard what had happened”. He said: “Every minute that passed seemed like an hour. The longer it went, the more concerning it got. “I was honoured to have known him. He was such an inspiration, his engagement was incredible. He made sense of a crazy world.” This morning, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour Leader Keir Starmer made a joint visit to pay their respects at the church. They laid flowers outside the building and stood in a united moment of reflection. They were joined by Home Secretary Priti Patel, who has called for an ­immediate review of security measures for MPs in light ofthe tragedy.Speaking outside Southend Police Station, Ms Patel said it is “right and proper” that MPs are accessible to the public and stressed that politicians’ safety and an open democracy “can absolutely be balanced”. Her comments came as a spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs’ Council confirmed every parliamentarian will be contacted about their ­security by a chief constable as part of a review. As Sir David’s community reeled from his death, Muslim leaders in Southend slammed the attack as an “indefensible atrocity”, adding: “We condemn it in the strongest possible terms. A joint statement from representatives of local mosques continued: “This act was committed in the name of blind hatred and we look forward to the perpetrator being brought to justice.” Members or the Muslim community also left flowers at the scene. Ruhul Shamsuddim said: “He was so kind to our community. He was always smiling. We send our best ­wishes to his family.”  Former homeless couple Darren Bailey and Emma Hayter spoke of how Sir David took the time to listen to their stories two weeks ago. Recalling the meeting on September , Darren, , said: “I told him how it had been really scary being on my own, and at times I didn’t want to be here any more as I had no purpose. “He was a great listener. It really helped to have someone of his level encourage me.” Greg Myers, , a former host of Basildon Hospital Radio, said: “He was an incredibly supportive character... He would never say that anything was impossible.” Sir David, a Brexiteer and pro-le advocate, had represented Southend West since . Prior to that, he was MP for nearby Basildon from . The animal rights campaigner voted against fox hunting and championed awareness of endometriosis. A keen follower of Middle East affairs, he was a critic of the Iranian regime and chairman of the UK’s Qatar All Party Parliamentary Group. He was also a former member of Conservative Friends of Israel,which said it was “deeply saddened” by his death.For Alex, there is a “big sense of grief” at the loss of a man who, despite his many interests, worked tirelessly to make his constituents’ lives better. He said: “I saw him at church services, military parades, all sorts of things. What stood out was that no event was too small or insignicant, no matter what it was. Sir David made people feel important.” Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Priti PatelBoris JohnsonDavid AmessSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

West Suffolk MP Mr Hancock accepted an offer to be an unpaid “UN special representative on financial innovation and climate change” for the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. But his rehabilitation into the upper echelons of public le has stalled amid an enormous public backlash.A UN spokesperson told Passblue, a non-profit news website covering the UN, that Mr Hancock’s role is “not being taken forward” and the UN Economic Commission for Africa “has advised him of the matter”.  Mr Hancock later confirmed the job offer was withdrawn due to a apostechnicalityapos. He accused the UN of belatedly realising he could not do the job at the same time as being an MP. Despite this, Gordon Brown was made a UN envoy while sitting as an MP in . The web page which had announced Mr Hancock’s new job has disappeared and now shows the words “access denied”, telling visitors: “You are not authorised to access this page!”Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter - and join the debate in the comments below.Global Justice Now director Nick Dearden said: If Matt Hancock wants to help African countries recover from the pandemic, he should lobby the prime minister to back a patent waiver on Covid- vaccines. If heaposd done that when he was in government, tens of millions more people could already have been vaccinated. The last thing the African continent needs is a failed British politician. This isnapost the th Century.  Mr Hancock had announced his job in the same week a probe found he’d presided over one of the most important public health failures in UK history at the start of the Covid pandemic. A joint probe by the Commons health and science committees found ministers made a “serious error” by taking a “gradual and incremental” approach to lockdowns last year. Experts said shutting down a week earlier than March , , would have cut the , death toll in the first wave “by at least half”. MPs concluded: “It is now clear this was the wrong policy, and that it led to a higher initial death toll than would have resulted from a more emphatic early policy. In a pandemic spreading rapidly and exponentially every week counted.” Yet when she offered him the job in September, UN under secretary-general Vera Songwe hailed Mr Hancock’s “success on the UK’s response to the Covid- pandemic”. She also praised his “global leadership, advocacy reach and in-depth understanding of government processes.”  Mr Hancockaposs job - which would have run alongside being an MP - would have seen him working with organisations like the IMF, G and COP in supporting Africaaposs path to recovery from Covid. Matt Fowler, co-founder of Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, who lost his -year-old father Ian in April last year, said: Given Matt Hancock contributed to the aposworst UK public health failure everapos and was forced to resign after breaching his own social distancing measures, maybe he should take care of his obligations to those of us who lost loved ones to Covid- in the UK by making sure the evidence the forthcoming inquiry will need is available before taking on any new challenges. We arenapost sure how he has the time to take up this new role given he seemingly hasnapost been able to pass emails from his personal Gmail account that relate to his handling of the pandemic to the Department of Health or Government. Then again, maybe when those emails are seen in the cold light of day maybe the UN would think twice about his appropriateness for this role. TVaposs Piers Morgan also hit out over the appointment, tweeting: Hancock’s reward for ‘one of the worst ever public health failures’ during his tenure as Health Secretary - a fancy new job at the UN. His timing for this announcement is almost as bad as his handling of the pandemic. Labour MP Alex Sobel tweeted: I’m a supporter of International Intergovernmental Organisations but ⁦@UN⁩ did you even do a little background check on Matt Hancock.apos Others had congratulated Mr Hancock on his new post, including Communities Secretary Michael Gove, who tweeted: Wishing @MattHancock well in this critical role supporting the developing world at a crucial time.In a statement, Mr Hancock said: I was honoured to be approached by the UN and appointed as special representative to the Economic Commission for Africa , to help drive forward an agenda of strengthening markets and bringing investment to Africa. The UN have written to me to explain that a technical UN rule has subsequently come to light which states that sitting members of parliament cannot also be UN special representatives. Since I am committed to continuing to serve as MP for West Suffolk, this means I cannot take up the position. I look forward to supporting the UN ECA in their mission in whatever way I can in my parliamentary role.

He was the Health Secretary who Dominic Cummings said should have been sacked  times. His main achievement was to hand a contract worth £million to his mate who ran his local pub. Eventually he lost his job when he was caught having an affair in his office. So this week the United Nations appointed him as envoy to help Africa’s economy recover from coronavirus. Hasn’t Africa suffered enough over the centuries  They had to put up with slavery and famine, now this. On Saturday the UN changed its mind, but this is terrying. Who gave him this job in the first place  It’s like finding a broken blender under the sink, with all the blades bent and bits missing. So you decide the best thing is to take it out to sea and shove it up a dolphin’s arse. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.  Hancock would have gone to the Sahara Desert and announced: “I’ve awarded a contract to my mate’s sister, who runs a bistro in the Cotswolds, to provide us with some sand for £million.” One of his tricks as Health Secretary was to deny there was a desperate shortage of PPE for medics and carers – and refuse to take any blame. So he’ll have been in Africa for a week, and discover he lost most of the vaccine when he left it on a bus. But he’ll blame Africans, saying: “The trouble is they have too many arms to jab. If they were less greedy and had one limb between three, there would be plenty to go round.” Hancock was Health Secretary in a government which, according to this week’s Health and Social Care Committee report, made Covid in Britain “signicantly worse” than in most other countries – and whose incompetence was “almost unimaginable.” So the obvious thing to do was put him in charge of Covid recovery somewhere , where health issues are easier to deal with, like Africa. If the UN finds someone who failed their driving test by reversing through a branch of Lidl before landing in a canal, they’d sign them up for Mercedes to race in next season’s Formula . So what changed their mind   Maybe all of Africa was preparing a charity record for Christmas. Rihanna, Kanye West, Bono and Adele would sing “He was sent to stop the virus but now we’ll all expire as, the stupid great disaster has spread it even faster.” Hancock shouldn’t be sent to countries by the UN to help them recover from disease, he should be sent as a sanctionthey break international law. They should warn North Korea: “If you don’t scrap your nuclear missiles, we’ll send Matt Hancock to run your health service.” The world would be at peace within a week. And the UN must have realised by the time he’d been there a few days, governments across Africa would be searching for a brave woman to have an affair with him, so he’d be sacked again.

Amir Jardan, captured the haunting photos at a graveyard in East Boldre, Hampshire, during a visit with his partner, Amy Notley, and his aunt, Suzanne Singleton. Itaposs definitely a ghost or a spirit of some sort, he said. Iaposm % sure that we were alone while in that graveyard. But we felt like something was watching us around the graves. In Amiraposs photo, the ghostly presence appears to take the form of a manaposs face peering over a headstone. In another picture, taken only seconds earlier, the same stone can be seen with nothing behind it but darkness.  The light of Suzanneaposs torch is visible in the background of both images. Mr Jardan, , said that up until that moment the graveyard had been eerily quiet. But after spotting the face in his photograph, the three of them believe they heard footsteps in the night. He said: In the picture you can see the man-shaped face. We were shocked and then we heard loads of walking around and we thought it could be someone so we left.  The experience has already made a believer out of -year-old Amy. Amy was a sceptic until she saw the picture I took and looked very confused, said Amir. The cemetery has a reputation for paranormal activity, he added. He said: There is a lot of history that this place has evil spirits and is one of the most haunted graveyards in the New Forest.Amir and Amy now plan to revisit the cemetery for an all-night ghost-watching vigil.We love exploring places, he said.We have no fear and we just want to capture evidence that ghosts exist. Next time it will be on video. Me and my partner thrive on travelling to spooky places together.

Freshers are letting gangs pass money through their accounts infor drugs, designer clothes or cash. Some gangs use girls to find recruits at campus parties. Others are lured on social media with fake offers of earning up to £, in deals on Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Students hand over bank details, allowing payments in and out. But it is money laundering, carrying up to  years in jail. In a second scam foreign students are offered a % reduction in uni fees. Money is paid to a rogue middleman, who “pays” online with a stolen bank card. By the time the payment “bounces” the agent has vanished, the student has lost thousands and faces being kicked out for non-payment.

Universities have issued warnings, with King’s College London declaring on its website: “This kind of scam will not only see you lose money, but you also risk imprisonment and an end to your university degree.” The National Crime Agency has been showing a film called Crooks on Campus – featuring real fraudsters – to hammer home the message to students.  Lancaster University’s Dr Nicola Harding said: “It is essential viewing for all students, staff, friends and parents”. In the past three years, £million has been blocked from , accounts over suspected money muling. The cash finances crime and even terrorism. In one case, in Yorkshire, a bank seized £, from the account of a student. Mule Student Ben, , fell for the money laundering scam in Yorkshire after a pal said he had made £, from it. He says: “I gave my card, pin and online banking login. A guy put money in. A week later he told me to withdraw £k. Next day I took another £k out. The third time the machine kept my card. “My account was frozen. Months later I got letters from other banks. This guy had opened four accounts, taken a loan and two credit cards out. It has destroyed my le. I am blacklisted.” Victim Lee, living in London, lost £, to a conman. He said: “I came to the UK on a student visa from China “There was a chat group, this guy was saying I could receive a % discount, £,, on my fees. He sent me a bank number, I transferred the money. “Everything seemed OK. Then the university told me there had been a problem. The fees had not been paid. “And unless I paid in two months I’d no longer have a place. I don’t have any money.

Liza Laure, a carer from Loughton, Essex, has been known to make jaws drop when people learn of her real age and insists sheaposs never had anti-wrinkle injections. Liza said: Sometimes, I feel embarrassed and other times I feel proud of myself as not many people can say they are mistaken for . I feel like I receive more compliments now than when I was younger which is crazy. Everywhere I go someone compliments me and cannot believe my age, strangers often think I am in between  or  years old.  I just say aposthank youapos as it is very flattering. I even get approached by younger men but I laugh it off. They are gobsmacked when they find out I am old enough to be their mother! Liza refuses to buy expensive skin care, she admits she is aposlow maintenanceapos. She uses an olive oil makeup remover which costs less than £. She said: My skin routine is very mundane.  I donapost have any expensive stuff as I am allergic to a lot of products, the cheaper the better, I say. I have never had Botox or fillers as I am too scared. I wear makeup and  eyelashes % of the time. But Liza has one way of keeping her lips looking youthful - by using a potato. Every three months, I cut a juicy potato in half and rub it on my lips. I donapost know where I got this technique but it helps keep them plump. It is a good and natural way to get full lips.  Liza gleams with confidence as she is hailed for her youthful skin, but she hasnapost always been this way. She was once apospainfully shyapos until she entered a beauty pageant in  and hasnapost looked back. She has since posed for the camera as a model for independent fashion and jewellery brands. Liza adds: I used to be very shy and quiet but one day, I decided I am going to push myself out of my comfort zone. I have never looked back. I am now confident and believe it is never apostoo lateapos to try new things. I have competed in four pageants and loved every second of each.

Barrie Enderby, , of Albion Street, Grimsby, has lived in the same flat for  years, but now has been left living in darkness and without a TV signal after trees grew so tall they block everything out. The retired refinery fitter wants to be able to climb the trees himself to fix the problem, but thanks to a recently heart operation to fix a pacemaker his plans have been cut short.Barrie complains his flat has been left in near constant darkness thanks to the ever-present shadow of the trees, GrimsbyLive reports.  He decided to treat himself to a new Sky TV box after coming out of hospital following his heart operation, but when the engineer arrived to fit it they found the copper beech and a sycamore trees blocked the signal. When they then tried to fit an extension cable to try and reach a signal it further upset neighbours who did not want cables on their wall. Barrie told Grimsby Live: I have lived here for  years and am the oldest resident. I am having to go through LHP to seeI can get the trees trimmed. They are not trees you should use for landscaping around flats. They are forest trees and should never have been planted here.  I have watched them grow. But over the years they have gradually blocked out all the light. You can see the sunrise in the east over the Smokers Arms pub, but I never see it until it is setting in the west and it comes through the kitchen window at the back. He added: I would like to climb up them and do it myself. But I have just had a pacemaker fitted. They did a brilliant job in hospital and I am feeling fine. Barrie said he treated himself to a new Sky package but when the engineer arrived he left disappointed.All I want to do is watch Netflix and all the sports, like, golf, cricket and football. I am a big fan of Bear Grylls and all the nature programmes, he said. Barrie added: I love nature and donapost want them chopping down. They are good for oxygen. But I have to keep the lights on through the day so that costs more. It will be more when the clocks go back at the end of the month. A LHP spokesman said: We are aware of a customer having problems with trees in Albion Street, Grimsby. Our contractors, Lindsey Tree Services undertake an annual inspection of trees on LHP property, where they identy any hazards and complete any associated work.

Tiny Erin Stones weighed just lb oz, had a hole in her heart and was unable to breathe on her own when she was born prematurely.Her mum, Claire, was told by medics that she was going to have a miscarriage when she went into the hospital for what she thought was a urine infection, reports WalesOnline. At that point I was still at  weeks andsheaposd been born at that stage she just wouldnapost have survived, said Claire, She was just too small. But when the little tot did not arrive within  hours, Claire was transferred to another hospital where she was told that every day Erin stayed inside the womb the greater the chance she had of survival. Erin arrived two weeks later and Claire said at first it feels like itaposs not your baby because itaposs not what youaposve prepared in your head your whole le. When she was born they took her and resuscitated her and they put a tube in so she was ventilated then she was brought over to me to hold her and have that moment before they whisked her away to have all the wires put in, she said.  Doctors spent months battling to keep the tiny tot alive as Erin remained on le support for the first month of her le with her organs massively underdeveloped, meaning she was unable to breathe by herself. She was also treated for  dferent infections.Even when we got her off the ventilator we were unable to bring her breathing support down, said Claire. She also had lots of dferent screenings for infections and sepsis. Whenever she had chest infections they would start her on antibiotics again.Erin also had a hole in her heart known as a PDA . When babies are in the womb they have the PDA to allow blood and oxygen to pass through but normally when babies are born it closes. With Erin, as she was so early, it just stayed open. They tried to close it with ibuprofen and paracetamol but it just didnapost work which caused blood to be pumped into her lungs. Aged just nine weeks, Erin had her first operation to close the hole in her heart. Claire said: It was very hard getting emotionally involved [with Erin] in the first few weeks because you knew at any point she could be taken away. When they are that small and that premature they donapost give you much hope. All they say is to take each day at a time. I just remember waking up every day and wondering whether she was going to live or die. But Erin overcame the odds and began building up her strength, eventually being taken off the le support machine and was transferred to a special care baby unit. It would be another three months until the little fighter was able to be discharged from hospital - six days after what was her original due date. Seeing my two daughters together for the first time was the biggest thing for me. I remember my husband Ed and Norah coming in to take us home and Norah holding Erinaposs hand in the car seat. That was amazing, added Claire. Erin didnapost give up and neither did the people who worked day and night caring for her and all the other babies on the unit every single day at the most critical of times.The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

He later put a note in her pocket saying \"wanna hook up\"Chanice Wilson was terried by the shocking ordeal Image: Daily RecordByKelly-Ann MillsReporterSian Traynor:,  Oct A mum has been left shaken after she was followed and touched by a stranger while looking after two young children. Chanice Wilson says she was approached by an older man as she headed to her local bus station on Monday, and wanted to speak up to warn other women. The -year-old had been out with her daughter and nephew in Glenrothes, but said she had noticed the man close behind them in a shop, before continuing to stay close to them. At one point the man picked up her one-year-old nephew and followed the trio around the aisles. Concerned by the situation, Chanice walked to the bus station where the man finally approached her and began to ask a series of uncomfortable questions. Terried and alone with the two children, Chanice held onto the boy and girl tightly as the stranger asked hershe lived alone.Speaking to the Daily Record, she said that the situation came to a head when the man had touched her bum as he slipped a note into her back pocket.  She read the note in horror and quickly saw it contained both a phone number and the words wanna hook up [sic]. She said: “I was looking after my nephew while I waited for his mum to come get him at the bus station. “We had gone through some of the shops while we were waiting. As we were walking through the first one, he was following at the back of us. “He was just acting really strange and every aisle I went down, even when I repeated aisles, he kept following us. “My nephew is only one year old and was walking along when this guy came and picked him up. I thought maybe he had fallen and I hadn’t realised so I then picked him up. “When I was paying, he was behind me before going to one of the other cashiers, then he sat on a bench outside the shop, like he was waiting for us to come out. “We walked down to the bottom of the town and I took my nephew and daughter into the toilet but when we came back out, he was there again. “I walked down to the bus station and as I was standing there, he came out and started asking me questions like where do I live, do I live alone. “He was just being really creepy and I didn’t want to answer him but he was so in my face and being really intimidating. “I was holding my daughter and nephew, so my hands were full, but then put his hand on my bum and slipped something into my back pocket. “I turned round and said ‘what the f*** are you doing ’ He said to just have a look and see and that his name was Scotty. “He walked away back into the bus station and stood at the bus station window - just looking out, watching me. At this point I started panicking. “My nephew’s mum showed up so I told her what was happening and she wanted to get him away so she went for her bus. “At this point it was just me and my daughter when he came back out and started circling around me, acting really strange. “I went up to a girl and asked herI could stand with her and explained that I was really scared and what had been happening. “This was a man in his late s and he was making me feel so uncomfortable. When I read the note, it had his name, his phone number and said ‘wanna hook up’ on it. “The girl said she would wait with me until her bus came so I called my boyfriend and gave him the number from the piece of paper. “I told him he was really scaring me and to move away because he was making me really anxious. “But the guy just started making weird noises down the phone and laughing. He was hanging up on my boyfriend and then calling him back.  “At first he claimed it wasn’t him, then he said he didn’t mean to hurt anyone because he had a split personality disorder and then called my boyfriend again to make the noises again. “It was like he was purposely trying to wind him up.” However, after continuing to stare at her, Chanice decided to jump on the next available bus, and sat next to an older woman and her daughter. She continued: “At this point I saw a bus coming and it looked like it was quite full so I decided to just get on it even though I didn’t know where it was going. I grabbed my daughter and went straight for the bus because he was still walking around. “But when he saw where I was going, he came out of the bus station and started walking really fast towards the bus. “I panicked and told an older lady that this guy was following me and was going to get on the bus. “The driver was moving away from the stance at this point so the guy started speeding up again so I just started shouting. “Everyone was looking at me like I was crazy - I think one actually realised I was being serious.” She added: “The driver eventually stopped the bus and I explained to him what had been happening. He said we were in Cowdenbeath and took us over the road to another stop. “He made sure we were okay and said there was another bus coming in four minutes that would take us straight home. “The woman who had helped us before on the bus got off and waited for us too because she obviously saw how frightened I was. It was a really horrible experience.“I put a post up on Facebook to warn people and a woman who worked in the shop had seen him following us and had asked her for a pen and paper.“The staff watched him follow me down but they didn’t think anything would happen. Other people have come forward saying he has done the same thing to them.”A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: Officers are investigating a report of a man acting suspiciously in Glenrothes town centre on Monday,  October, .Enquiries are at an early stage. A Stagecoach East Scotland spokeswoman added: We are truly proud of the actions of our driver, who helped get this woman out of an intimidating situation and to safety, as well as ensuring she could continue her onward journey.

But despite the urgent nature of her requests, Melissa was kept at priority band  for five years, meaning there were always people in front of her in the council house bidding process, BirminghamLive reports.Unable to cope, she gave up her small flat and started renting from a private landlord, but her rent has doubled as a result. Melissa, an office manager, said: “I spent five years bidding every week for a council house and never got close to getting one.  “We had a break-in, they smashed my bedroom window and got in. I disturbed them as I was coming home from work and they got away with my laptop.Then two weeks later, I had to chase a man out of my house after he broke in at around .am. My daughter was scared. She said she wanted a guard dog to keep the bad men away. When I asked the council what I should do they said I might as well rent privately.For my state of mind and my daughter’s safety, I decided to do it, I just couldn’t cope any more.” A probe by the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman found that Birmingham City Council is receiving an alarming  applications to join its housing register each week. The authority is struggling to process applications quickly enough, the investigation revealed. Melissa said: “It’s about time someone investigated how the council allocates housing to people, how certain people seem to get re-homed so quickly and others wait years. “I was a good tenant for  years, I kept my house immaculate and always paid my rent and council tax on time. “I’m lucky now that my landlord is amazing, it’s just the financial side of it that’s hard. “But we’ve got two bedrooms now so my daughter finally has her own bedroom. There’s a little conservatory which we’re using as a playroom for her. It’s a bit of a hike to school but for the relief of not being burgled and surrounded by heroin addicts outside our house, we don’t mind the travel. “Maddison loves having her own bedroom. We’re in a nice little cul de sac with neighbours who are lovely and friendly. And now we have a garden that no-one can get into, which is great A Birmingham City Council spokesman said: “For anyone in housing need the council provides help and support to source alternative accommodation,applicants consider that it is taking too long to obtain social housing. To help with renting in the Private Rented Sector we have introduced a new scheme with HelpRent, an organisation that makes social housing simple for tenants and landlords and provides incentives to landlords who offer -month fixed tenancies to those on the Council’s homeless and housing registers.

Andany dish isnapost up to standard, they might risk getting a note from Her Majesty voicing her displeasure - with a little bit of her humour thrown in for good measure. Thataposs apparently what happened when the Queen once discovered something rather unwelcome in her salad. The monarch reportedly tore off a page from the comments book meant to be used to convey her appreciation - or distaste - to the chef in the kitchens. An on this occasion she placed a dead slug on the page before writing aposI found this in the salad - could you eat it apos and sending it back to the kitchen, the Daily Mailaposs Weekend magazine reports.  But despite being head of state, the Queen is said to have a simple taste when it comes to food with one of her former chefs, Darren McGrady, revealing she likes clean and simple meals such as grilled Dover sole on wilted spinach. She selects her meals from a red leather-bound book put together by the royal chef. She marks her choices in pencil, crossing out dishes she doesnapost want and writing in suggestions.

During the week she wakes at .am and receives a cup of Darjeeling tea from her chambermaid, which she sips while listening to Radio ’s Today programme. At her breakfast table cereals are presented in Tupperware containers. She also likes yoghurt, and marmalade on toast, sometimes tossing the crusts to her beloved dogs.  For afternoon tea, usually at pm, she takes a selection of sandwiches with the crusts cut off and cakes including chocolate, ginger and fruit cake. McGrady, who worked as a royal chef for  years, said dinner would be game or fish from one of the royal estates, and the Queen loves white peaches from the greenhouse at Windsor Castle. She is not thought to cook for herself but she’s said to be more than happy to help with the washing up.

Reverend Clford Newman, of Belfairs Methodist Church, who only started his job two weeks ago, said the community has now been left to pick up the pieces after the fatal stabbing of the -year-old Tory. Tributes have been pouring in from people across the political spectrum after the dad-of-five was brutally killed while visiting constituents on Friday afternoon. A -year-old man remains in custody on suspicion of murder having been arrested yesterday. Police are treating the incident as terror-related.Reverend Clford Newman has now spoken to say his words will never fully express how the community is feeling, EssexLive reports. He said: Itaposs not just an MP, itaposs a father, itaposs a husband to his we.  As for the church, a church is not just a building, itaposs full of members. It hits them personally. Itaposs going to be hard for them to overcome. Thereaposs no justication for it, no matter what your belief. Weaposll just have to pick up the pieces and move forward as closely as we can. This man served his community as best he could. To take his le is just devastating and reprehensible.  Iaposve been here two weeks, but it doesnapost matteritaposs two weeks or two years, itaposs still devastating. No words will express how we really feel. Tributes and flowers have been piling up at the edge of the cordon, with residents coming in their droves to pay their respects throughout the morning. While many members of the media from around the world remained at the scene, residents were also in attendance looking on. Leigh-on-Sea resident Gary Coverly, , told EssexLive that the Tory MP once came around to his neighbour’s home when he turned , and then took him out for the day. He also said he was a “fantastic bloke” who “always stood up for you”.  Paying tribute to him at the scene, Mr Coverly said: He was such a nice man. He came around to campaign a lot and he was fantastic, a really pleasant bloke to talk to. My neighbour was  the other year, he visited him and took him out. I came from Basildon and moved up here. He was always an approachable chap, he would listen to you. If you didnapost agree he would have a polite debate. Itaposs such a shock, Iaposve lived here since . My neighbour was Labour, but talking to him, [Sir David] was always polite and courteous. Greg Myers, , from Southend, is a former host of Basildon Hospital Radio, and worked with Sir David when he was an MP for Basildon in the s. He said: He was an incredibly supportive character. He always tried to get the community interest together. I knew him very well. He attended all the community meetings, everyone knew him and he was supportive. A few years ago I ran into him and he still remembered me. He would never say that anything was impossible. He would try to get things done at all times. Stephen Noakes, manager of AC Taxis in Southend who lives in Leigh-on-Sea, also worked with Sir David on many occasions. He said I first met Sir David when he was helping the Southend Taxi trade. Since then Sir David has helped me personally, he has also helped my friends and family. Whatever your political views, I believe Sir David was a fantastic MP and person.

The LE postcode, covering just part of the East Midlands city, is top of the table with  thefts recorded by police last year. The list, obtained in a Freedom of Information request to the DVLA, puts the SL postcode in Slough, just down the road from Royal Windsor, in second place. Fiestas are the most popular model for car bandits, followed by the VW Golf, Ford Focus and the Vauxhall Corsa. But in affluent postcodes in parts of Aldershot, Hants, and Swindon, Wilts, the Range Rover Evoque and Land Rover Discovery were the favourite steal. While London remains the national hotspot for all auto crimes, including break-ins, the Sunday People data pinpoints exact localities where vehicles are stolen.And they are nicked in huge numbers – one every seven minutes in the UK last year. That’s almost , – up % on .Other postcodes in the top  are in Darlington, Milton Keynes and Stockport. Expensive marques including Mercedes and Audis are targeted for export by gangs stealing to order for rich clients.Remote control jamming technology has made it easier to get into cars with electronic locking.Police and motoring associations warn drivers to park only in busier areas, preferably where CCTV cameras are visible. Owners are also advised to park with wheels at an angle to make it more dficult for vehicles to be pushed or towed away.  The AA’s Luke Bosdet said owners should look out for clues to an area’s theft rate.He said: “The place to go is local police Twitter, crime reports and local media. They act as an early warning for a possible spate of thefts so that owners can take preventative action. “Put the car in a garageyou have one, alert neighbours and look out for any suspicious activity when walking the dog.” ■ Number of vehicles recorded as stolen by the police and noted on DVLA records by UK postcode area between January  and December , .

For the next six months, she attended sessions once a month and completed gentle exercises. “I couldn’t participate in the exercises as I couldn’t walk, so I sat on a chair while the others walked, which was so embarrassing. “I was told to lose five per cent of my body weight.” Maxine met with a psychiatrist, a dietician, a nurse, and a surgeon to talk about bariatric surgery - a iety of procedures performed on people who are obese.

Finnley was lbs oz when he was born, nearly double that of the average weight of a newborn. Parents, Cary and Tim Patonai, knew they were expecting a big baby with doctors predicting he would weigh around .lbs when he was born. Cary said: He was so big plus I had almost double the amniotic fluid, so to say I had a big baby belly and that I was absolutely completely uncomfortable isnapost enough. She had been scheduled in for a C-section but her surgery was moved forward when her waters broke at a doctoraposs appointment, ironically, as she stood on the scales to be weighed. As soon as they pulled him out, theyaposre like, aposOh my gosh, thataposs huge!apos she added. Everybody was freaking out, like, aposIaposve never seen a baby that big, I canapost believe itapos. So perfect and round in every way. Heaposs definitely my squishy little honey bear. Finnley was born at Banner Thunderbird Medical Center in Glendale, Arizona, and was the biggest Caryaposs doctor had delivered in  years of practice - and he was quite tall too measuring . inches. And the little trooperaposs size meant the hospital had to specially order in bigger sized nappies as they didnapost stock ones that he could fit into. Cary also said how the family had to rush out for more baby clothes in size six to nine months as everything we had was entirely too small. The beaming mum said Finnley became a little celebrity at the hospital and nurses and doctors were non-stop talking about him. There was one point in the NICU that he was with one of four babies, and his weight was their three total altogether, so we were laughing at that, Cary said. He is such a good sweet baby. I am so grateful everything ended on such a great positive side, she added. Finnleyaposs two brothers - Devlen, , and Everett,  - were also born on the larger size with them weighing . lbs and . lbs when they were born through C-section.

Her video proved popular on the social media  and other users praised her for sharing the simple trick, as the Daily Star reports.When the water starts to boil, Kristy drops an ice cube into the pan and it instantly lowers the temperature - preventing it from spilling over the side.What do you think about the hack  Let us know in the comments...Believe it or not, there is a very good scientic explanation behind why the ice cube stopped the water from boiling over.According to a thread on physics.stackexchange : When you put a pot of water on the stove and turn the burner on, the heat source of the stove gets hot relatively fast, but the water takes a while to boil.For multiple reasons it takes a while for the water to heat up, or in other words for the heat of the burner to be transferred throughout the pot of water. When you add the ice cube to the boiling water, you very quickly cool off the boiling water which will cause the water to stop boiling. It will then take some time for the heat from the burner to heat the water back up to boiling.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. Thereaposs a lot of caveats to take into account, for example,you drop a small ice cube into a massive pot of boiling water, youaposll only cool of a small bit of the water near the surface, and maybe only at part of the surface, so you may not even notice the stopped boiling. On TikTok, Kirsty admitted that she could have just turned the heat down, but throwing in an ice cube was the faster solution. Comments under the video also suggested a wooden spoon could be used for the same purpose.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

But, while itaposs fairly common to develop whataposs known as aposthe ick,apos one woman was caught completely off-guard when her Hinge date launched into a vicious tirade against her, all because she described herself as a aposdog mom.aposTikTok user Kristen Beatty @kristenbeattymatched with her date on Hinge after recognising his photos and later discovering they lived in the same apartment block.The pair met up for a casual drink in their communal garden area and things were going great - Kristen told him all about her dog and he said he absolutely loved animals. Following on from the date, the man even met her dog, but things turned awkward when he left to go on another date. Seriously not cool, guy. However, in an attempt to ensure they wouldnapost endure any awkwardness living in the same building, Kristen decided to send her date a text to let him know it was aposNational Dog Mom Day.apos I said it was aposNational dog-mom-dayapos and your boy did not take it so well, and you better believe I kept the receipts, Kristen explained in a clip, before sharing a response from the man which read: For real  I admire real moms. Parenting a human is  percent more rewarding than a pet. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.  He then asked her: Do you put yourself in that category being a aposdog momapos to which the woman responded: I own a dog, so yeah. Clearly perturbed by her answer, the man then wrote: Bye. I find that childish. Kristen then started laughing and pointed out that the conversation should have ended there, but the man continued: Anyone can take care of a pet, you donapost need recognition for it, Iaposm sorry. She tried to explain that she wasnapost comparing being a dog parent to being a human parent and pointed out that she never asked for any recognition, but that didnapost stop the angry bile from spilling from her date. Well thataposs what that is. Nobody cares that youaposre a dog mom. Why the need for a title  They want recognition or  you wouldnapost have it. Society is a joke. Iaposm a serious person. Iaposm not liberal by any means. He continued: Let me guess, you put clothes on your dog  Let it sleep with you in bed  Think of it as your child  Clearly, we wonapost get along.

But while most of us have the luxury of watching horrors unfold on the big screen, one woman has revealed her real-le nightmare, which found her sleeping three feet away from a dead body for eight weeks. The nightmare began in May last year, when the pandemic was really starting to take hold, and the majority of people in the US had been cooped up inside for two months.Reagan Baylee, who goes by the handle @reaganbaylee on TikTok, lived alone in a  square foot studio apartment in the Valley in Los Angeles, when she started noticing an off smell, which was beginning to make her feel unwell. I was having headaches, I wasn’t really sleeping through the night, I was feeling nauseous a lot and honestly we all kind of rode it off as me just feeling a little lonely and going a little crazy during quarantine, just like everyone  was, she explained in a harrowing clip.It was really unlike me to not be able to sleep through the night so I thought this was really strange but again I just kind of wrote it off because I just thought I was really sad and depressed. But, in addition to the odd smell, Reagan noticed an increasing number of bugs and spiders appearing in her apartment, which prompted her to complain to her manager, who said she wouldnapost be able to come out and check due to the pandemic. Truthfully my best description of this smell was kind of like a dead fish so I thought that maybe a bird had caught a fish but in retrospect is the most stupid thing ever because thereaposs no lakes anywhere near me. I started thinking maybe my neighbour who lived to the right of me had like, his dog had died or something had happened and I got really worried, but my manager told me she can’t just start knocking on neighbour’s doors and bothering them, Reagan continued. But I had this really bad feeling that something was super wrong and the smell was getting really bad every time it was windy and I was really, really worried. But remember, it’s the middle of the pandemic and we had been home  hours a day, seven days a week so I think I had got kind of used to the smell. Still disturbed by the smell, Reagan called over her boyfriend to get a second opinion, who agreed it was horric and also started to experience nausea and trouble sleeping. Her manager was still refusing to do anything, so she ended up calling the police, who came round and checked on her neighbour, only to discover they were perfectly fine.  My manager was pretty upset with me because I was disturbing my neighbours and then they gave me a notice saying that I can’t be harassing people in the building, Reagan continued. I consulted the police and they told me after  hours,my manager didn’t convene then I could call them again. And this is when things got crazy. I felt like I was on a mission because no one was listening to me and manager was making me out to feel crazy. During this time, riots were taking place in Los Angeles following the death of George Floyd, so Reagan admitted she understood that police were preoccupied and her complaining about spiders and bad smells was the least of anyoneaposs worries. A few days later, Reagan finally convinced her manager to send a maintenance man round to the apartment block, but when he arrived, he could barely even get up the stairs due to the stench coming out of her neighbouraposs home. She said: He’d walked up the stairs, he couldnapost even make it up the stairs without starting to vomit. He ripped off his mask and said aposI am going to get the master key, someone is dead.apos I immediately start freaking out because I felt so validated after weeks and weeks of feeling crazy and complaining, and no one believing me.  However, the maintenance man did not , so Regan had no choice but to call the police once more, and within minutes around eight officers had broken their way into the apartment. After gathering all the information they needed from Reagan, the officers decided to investigate the apartment to the left of hers, since they had already checked on the neighbour to the right hand side. There’s six cops they all have their guns drawn and they say LAPD, exit with your hands raised in the air, you’ve got  seconds, we’re going to start counting down. Right before the end of the  seconds, one of the cops says hey let’s draw down our guns, can anybody just try to open the door and seeit’s unlocked, she recalled. And I was like aposwhy would it be unlocked apos Brace yourself… So the cop twists the doorknob and he opens it maybe an inch. The amount of bugs that came out of this unit, it looked like , bugs, thousands of them, flying out of the unit. Reagan continued: They immediately slam the door and the cops called for a ton of backup. The cops started ripping off their masks and multiple of them were throwing up over the side of the railing. I slammed my door and they told me to stay inside and don’t come out. Long story short, they said this was the worst decomposed body they had ever come across and they see a lot of decomposed bodies. I’m not going to go too into the specics of it, especially for the privacy of the person, but let’s just say they were liquied and they were basically a skeleton at this point. All the symptoms my boyfriend and I were experiencing were simply because of the fumes and toxic that were releasing from the body and the natural gases that were making me extremely sick during pretty much all of quarantine. That really is like something our of a horror film.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

In the wake of the summer space race between Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, the world’s richest men are taking on a new challenge – immortality. Amazon boss Bezos, , is one of the main backers of Altos Labs, which has raised £million and just opened a new laboratory in Cambridge. But Bezos, worth £billion, is far from being the only one taking on the grim reaper. Google co-founder Sergey Brin, , has invested more than £million in a “longevity lab” called Calico.And Paypal founder Peter Thiel, , has pledged £million to the similarly-tasked SENS Research Foundation.  Meanwhile Russian tech mogul Yuri Milner,  – worth around £billion – has handed grants worth millions of pounds to the science of anti-ageing. Longevity expert Michael Rae, , from Calornia’s Bay Area, tells the Sunday People that the science of living forever is making huge leaps forward. As well as being backed by Thiel, his SENS group has also had meetings with Bezos. And with big-money backing, he is optimistic the secret to eternal le can be cracked by . Because the technology is so expensive to develop, it will be available only to the rich at first.  But scientists believe that once it is rolled out to the general population, le expectancy could be raised to around , years. They claim the only causes of death will then be bad luck – and stupid mistakes. Rae revealed: “Bezos is taking a gamble on a technology that is harder to realise – but it’s going to have a really big payoffthey can make it work. “Reprogramming technology is exciting because,we can wind the clock back and make our cells youthful again, that will help to finally break the link between age and death.  “Will this happen in five years or  years  Absolutely not. “But in a quarter of a century, quite possibly yes. “Especially now that there has been this large infusion of money and Bezos has so many talented scientists working for him.” Here, we look at the five main theories on achieving immortality – and how soon the phrase “within our letime” will cease to have any meaning. Stopping bodies ageing They say that death and taxes are the two things you cannot avoid. But the SENS Research Foundation, based in Mountain View, Calornia, believes ageing is a disease that can be tackled like any other. Its goal is to “comprehensively repair the damage that builds up in our bodies over time”.  One research strand is askingbackup copies of cells can be created to replace maling ones. The new cells would be implanted in our flesh so they can take over when our system starts to degrade. This would mean we can refurbish our bodies time and again – like we replace faulty chips in a computer. Michael Rae, , a science writer at the foundation, explains: “The Big Kahuna is when we get to the point that your le expectancy is no longer aof your age. “Right now, every year you live, you’re closer to your doom. Once you take away ageing, it becomes open-ended. That doesn’t mean you’re immortal – you can still be murdered or hit by a catastrophic infection like Ebola, or die in a plane crash. “But you are no longer going to be more vulnerable to disease and death. “At that point,you do the maths on how unlikely it is to die, it gives a le expectancy of about , years. “You can still die the next day, or live to , years. It becomes about what happens in your le.” Cryogenics and articial intelligence Some scientists believe that in the future a computer will store our DNA code and will send out warnings when we need gene therapy – warding off fatal diseases by removing genetic mutations. Implanted microchips would also alert doctors to the ageing of our cells. They even hope to back up our personalities online so thatwe die we could be downloaded to a robot or hologram, keeping us going well beyond our -year le expectancy.  Russian billionaire Dmitry Itskov is putting his money behind this idea and has founded a non-profit called the  Initiative to fund the research. Another aspect of the immortality industry – said to be worth £bn worldwide – is cryogenic freezing, storing corpses in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -°C. Since , Alcor in Arizona has preserved  clients, including  Brits, at £, each… with the hope of bringing them back to le when technology advances enough. Anti-ageing drugs Longevity expert Michael Rae is hopeful that death from serious disease will plummet in the next decade as anti-ageing drugs currently in development hit the market. He said: “One rejuvenation technology I suspect is going to be coming pretty quickly, in the next  years, is with drugs called senolytics. “There are certain cells that stop reproducing themselves and become metabolically abnormal. “They start excreting all kinds of inflammatory factors that make them more prone to becoming cancerous. “Senolytic drugs selectively kill those cells – there’s evidence that the body becomes rejuvenated in a wide iety of ways when you use them. “These drugs should be effective in eliminating a number of age-related diseases, which is a big step forward. “The immune system can already remove these damaged cells – but it seems it either falls apart as we age or it’s just incomplete. “We’re working on a range of ways to make it easier for your immune system to clear those cells out. “One thing we’re looking at to do this is by using engineered cells that will do the job for you.” Are there any ethical concerns  It is hard to imagine a world where people live to , years old. The Earth is overpopulated already and headed for an environmental disaster. So what effect would a population explosion have, as living conditions become even more cramped and we consume record amounts of meat and fuel  Michael Rae bats aside these concerns.  He is more worried about the thousands who die every day from age-related issues. And he pleads for world leaders – and the public – to start donating to research centres such as SENS. He said: “The big concern I have about the research is that it’s not going fast enough because it’s not being funded adequately. “We’re not going half as fast as I’d like – every day that we’re delayed, we have another , people dead from this plague of ageing. “I watched my grandparents die. My grandfather was living on oxygen and had a hard time walking around by the time he passed. “My grandmother was almost blind and needed help getting out of bed. “I’ve done a iety of things to keep myself healthy, but I’m conscious the science is not developing as quickly as I would want. “Beyond that, yes there are concerns. If we unshackle people from the ageing process, the population is going to increase over time and that could pose certain ecological constraints.  “It’s certainly going to pose a need for rethinking things like retirement ages and pension plans – and the way we structure our lives around ageing and dying. “But one has to maintain a sense of proportion. These things have technical fixes. “We have to be better about using resources on all kinds of fronts because the world is already headed for an environmental disaster. “Are we really saying the solution to things like our ecological problems is that people have to keep dying of cancer and heart attacks ” Biological reprogramming technology Amazon boss Jeff Bezos is reported to be one of the main backers of Altos Labs, a collection of state-of-the-art research centres in Cambridge, Japan and Calornia headed by US scientist and cancer expert Richard Klausner. The scientists here are using £million of funding to develop something known as “biological reprogramming technology”. This will allow the cells in our body to be rejuvenated, turning back the clock and reversing the ageing process. There is also hope that the research will bring an end to le-changing conditions such as Parkinson’s, heart disease and cancer – as our cells will no longer degenerate and mutate. One new scientist on the team, Spaniard Manuel Serrano, says he was offered five times his salary to move to Cambridge to work for Altos Labs, showing the firm is recruiting the best and brightest in the business. Expert Michael Rae told us: “Reprogramming technology is taking a cell that has accumulated age-related changes that are dysal and winding the clock back. “You remove some of those abnormal changes, so it behaves like a youthful cell. “Once you’ve done that it starts ageing again. So eventually you will have to wind it back again and again – but that’s fine as long as you keep up with it. “In some ways that is even more exciting becauseyou are  years old and you can wind the clock back, you’ve done a lot for that person. “Bezos is in his s – so he has made a bet that’s going to pay out at a very good time for him.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON GooglePaypal Inc.Silicon Valley PLCScientic LaboratoriesElon MuskMichael RaeJeff BezosRichard BransonImmune systemLe expectancyBillionairesSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Even worse ahead of a challenging October where the Dons will face Hibs, Rangers, Hearts and Motherwell.Aberdeen were punished for defensive slackness and big players such as Ryan Hedges, Lewis Ferguson and Christian Ramirez did not do enough on the night.US-based chairman Dave Cormack was at Dens Park to watch the Reds# slump reach another low.A summer rebuild where manager Stephen Glass was given the backing to rebuild the team with  new signings has yet to click.There were three changes to the Aberdeen starting XI that lost - to Celtic before the international break.Welsh international attacker Ryan Hedges ed having missed the Celtic loss due to illness.Also ing to the starting line-up were Scotland international centre-back Declan Gallagher and Funso Ojo.On-loan duo Austin Samuelsand Matty Longstaffdropped to the bench, with Ross McCrorie not in the squad due to injury.In the build up to the game, boss Stephen Glass had said he faced a goalkeeper selection headache due to Joe Lewis# response in training during the international break.Lewis had been dropped to the bench for the loss to Celtic. It was the first time the -year-old had not started a game he has been fit and available for since signing for Aberdeen in summer .Ultimately any decision was taken out of Glass# hands as Lewis was ruled out of the Dundee clash by illness.Teenage keeper Tom Ritchie was on the bench.COYR!#StandFree pic EXdjFAebmdash Aberdeen FCOctober , Dundee created the first opening in the first minute when Luke McCowan tried to shape a -yard drive from the left flank into goal but Woods punched clear.The home side started the more positive and were dictating the tempo and threatened when Leigh Grfiths, on loan from Celtic, heading wide of goal from the centre of the box.In the th minute Calvin Ramsay played a corner kick from the left low into the box to meet the on-running Ryan Hedges, who had raced into space.However, Hedges shot high and wide from  yards.In the rd minute Lewis Ferguson headed wide from the centre of the box.Superb play from Charlie Adam in the heart of midfield moments later saw the veteran nutmeg Scott Brown before unleashing a superb cross field pass to McCowan who shot wide from  yards.It was terric play from Adam and McCowan#s shot failed to do it justice.Aberdeen came close in the st minute when Ramsay#s corner kick picked out Ramirez, who unleashed a powerful ing header from  yards, but Grfiths was on hand to head off the line at the near post.The loose ball was cleared out as far as Jonny Hayes, who shot just over from  yards.There was plenty of hard work and determination from both sides but little cutting edge in front of goal in a tense opening  minutes.Aberdeen fell behind in the th minute when Paul McMullan played a superb ball upfield to Grfiths.Centre-back David Bates tried to play Grfiths offside, but he got it wrong as the striker timed his run in behind the defence perfectly.Grfiths raced in on goal and drilled a right-footed shot from just inside the box through the legs of keeper Woods.Moments later Ferguson hit a low shot in from  yards, but keeper Legzdins pushed the weak shot wide.Aberdeen#s night plunged further into trouble on  minutes when McGhee played a pass into McGowan at the edge of the area and the Dundee player curled a shot low beyond Woods.Yet again the defending was terrible and was punished.Aberdeen secured a leline in the th minute when Declan Gallagher pushed upfield in possession before fining Jack MacKenzie.Left-back MacKenzie curled an inviting cross along the face of goal.No Dundee defender cleared it and Ramirez drted into a pocket of space at the back post to send a right-footed shot in from eight yards.Moments later Hedges fired in a powerful shot, but keeper Legzdins saved.Aberdeen pushed forward in a bid to salvage something from the game that got more and more frantic.Dons# goalkeeping coach Gordon Marshall was sent to the stand as emotions boiled over.There were nine minutes of injury time, but it still wasn#t enough to prevent crashing to a fth successive Premiership defeat.

Yet we often treat them in a dismissive way.Let#s think about some insects.Take the bluebottle. How often has it outwitted us with its amazing flight paths, ducking and ing to avoid our threatening gestures.While we have developed some of the most sophisticated flying machines the world has known, none can match the bluebottle in its agility.We have mentioned pollination. What insect is more important than the bee as it goes about its business from flower to flower ensuring that the plants will produce seed for another year and giving us honey as a product of its labours.How beautul too are its colours and the structure of its body – a remarkable little insect.Then there is the humble moth and its gravity-defying antics walking across ceilings. It has a very fragile body but in its short le can nevertheless act out its own acrobatic skill in an amazing performance.Or we may think of the spider and the beauty of its web, perhaps seen on a frosty winter morning. A true work of art woven with such delicacy.In the bible we read this: #Go watch the ants, you lazy person. Watch what they do and be wise. Ants have no commander, no leader or ruler, but they store up food in the summer and gather their supplies at harvest.# From this we can learn four things helpful to living: be diligent and hard-working have an #I can do it# attitude plan ahead remember teamwork is important."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader october 1 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowIt#s a strange one, the fuel situation.There seems to be no one reason for it but, for whatever reason, a sort of mass hysteria seems to have taken hold where in the UK.

It remains unfinished and forms part of a trove of stories currently being sted through by an archivist under the direction of his children. Donrsquot bet against the best of the work seeing the light of day some time soon.Silverview opens in a street in Londonrsquos West End. Itrsquos the kind of street which, in earlier le Carreacute novels, would have been dowdy and unassuming. Today, thanks to foreign buyers hungry for big-ticket real estate, it is nothing of the sort. Now, le Carreacute tells us, the houses are ldquoso grand they had no numbers at all. Navigating this street with her two-year-old son in a pram is a young woman called Lily. She arrives at a ldquopretentious doorway, buzzes, and is admitted. She has a message to deliver to somebody inside. To him and only him.The place is a safe-house and the interior, at least, is familiar to fans of le Carreacutersquos oeuvre. The sitting room is ldquospartan, the furniture lumpy. There are grubby net curtains, a scratched glass coffee table and a Thermos flask filled with something you just know isnrsquot hand-roasted single origin Arabica. The recipient of the message is also familiar, or at least his type is. Hersquos Stewart Proctor, a man whose family boasts among its number QCs, doctors, a broadsheet editor, ldquono politicians, thank God and ldquoa healthy crop of spies. The Proctors send their brightest to Winchester, their second-brightest to Marlborough and a few here and there, ldquowhere need or principle dictated, to state school. Itrsquos a lovely, concise pen portrait of the kind of people still populating the upper reaches of the civil service, the law and the media.Proctor, of course, is a spy himself. Known within the service as Proctor the Doctor, hersquos a high-ranking intelligence official whose job is cutely termed Domestic Security. In other words, he hunts moles and plugs leaks but, like George Smiley, he does it in a quiet, studious, polite fashion. Hersquos an engaging creation. Letrsquos hope le Carreacute has put him to use where in whatever unpublished work remains.So, what is the nature of the leak Proctor is investigating  Who is the mole  Is there actually a leak at all and,there isnrsquot, does that mean therersquos no mole either  Fielding cryptic text messages from on highProctor is soon on his way to ldquoone of East Angliarsquos more remote stations. There he is met by a Jeep and whisked off to an air force base containing a nuclear command centre, once vital but now effectively mothballed. Still, the Americans on the base mustnrsquot find out that somethingrsquos amiss. Are these the horses Stewart must not frighten Cut to a small seaside town in the wilds of ndash wouldnrsquot you know it  ndash East Anglia and the action, such as it is, begins. Julian Lawndsley, aged , has jacked in a lucrativesoulless job in the City and bought himself a bookshop, despite not knowing the first thing about books or literature. After much consideration he has christened it Lawndsleyrsquos Better Books and installed a coffee machine and a tiny cafeacute area. One morning, in a greasy spoon run by an eacutemigreacute Pole on the down-at-heel sea-front, he bumps into a customer from the previous evening, a man who bought nothing but who recommended he stock WG Sebaldrsquos The Rings Of Saturn. Typically, Julian had never heard of it.The man is Edward Avon. Le Carreacute gives him a fawn raincoat to wear and pops a broad-brimmed homburg hat over his ldquorebellious mop of white hair. He has graceful hands and reads . Julian thinks he has a ldquovery slight foreign flavour to his cadence and notices that Edward gives Sebaldrsquos surname its proper German pronunciation ndash Zaybult.The novelrsquos title is an English translation of Silberblick, the name of the house in Weimar in which philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche spent his final years. Itrsquos the name Edward has given to the house he shares with his clever, imperious we Deborah, who is dying of cancer. Later, Julian is invited to dine there, by which time he and Edward have formed an unlikely friendship, one strong enough to not be tested by several unlikely requests from the older man.The first of these is the proposal that he and Julian pool their talents to open a bookshop-within-a-bookshop, to be called The Republic Of Literature. Julian will provide the basement , while Edward will knock up a list of whatrsquos needed, stock wise. The second is that Julian take a trip to London to deliver a letter to a woman Edward refers to as Mary, though that obviously isnrsquot her real name. A lover or a mistress, Julian presumes.Silverview is relatively slightand unusually breezy, and therersquos no doubting where the authorrsquos sympathies lie or who he has in his crosshairs. Tories, lawyers, the City and the mediocre talents currently running the country and the intelligence services all take a hit. So do cultivated ambivalence and ndash rich this, for a spy writer ndash dishonesty.But the novel is also typicallyelliptical. As ever, le Carreacute circles his characters masterfully, letting the parallel stories ndash Proctor and his investigation, Julian and Edward and their putative Republic Of Literature ndash spiral down towards each other. Lily, of course, emerges with a starring role, and therersquos a dazzling episode in which Proctor meets up with two old service hands, a married couple, to winkle out a fact or three about his target. Itrsquos classic le Carreacute: what is said and what is meant never quite cohere. Close your eyes and you can almost imagine itrsquos George and Connie Sachs discussing Moscow Centre hoods over a bottle of Scotch. And who is the target  That would be telling.If this is the quality le Carreacute was producing in the last years of his le, we can be certain there are further posthumous delights coming our way."},{"url":null,"title":"travel-kintyre-peninsula-glenbarr-stores","story":"The journey prepared us well. We started in Glasgow, but bit by bit the city and the noise dropped away. Motorway, then A-road, then B-road, then single track, then a path that goes down, and down, to the place we want to see. There it is up ahead, where the land is trying to stop the sea but the sea is fighting back: a small cluster of white buildings with a black-capped tower. The result of Robert Stevensonrsquos efforts, and Thomas Smithrsquos, and all the others: the Mull of Kintyre lighthouse.It is an extraordinary place. At the front of the structure is the power house and a cluster of bedrooms and in the middle is the tower, still resisting the wind and the water and the salt. We make our way through the corridors between the buildings, where the wind dies, and up ahead is the old foghorn perched on the line between clf and sky. Itrsquos rusted and old and hasnrsquot been used since the s but it still points out to sea asitrsquos ready to issue the warning.The light is automated now of course, but it first shone here  years ago, when Smith, the engineer, assisted by Stevenson , and the mason George Shield and his assistants succeeded in planning and building a lighthouse in the most unlikely spot. It is ft above the sea there is no access by boat there was no road the materials had to be loaded by boat six miles away and taken on horseback over the hills. It took two years but they did it. And here it is: still there.We wander round the buildings and lie on the grass in the little, sloped garden where the keepers used to hang their washing before heading back and itrsquos not easy. The slope that was an advantage on the way here is the disadvantage on the way back, but itrsquos rewarding. Regular stops and rests are needed, even for Molly the dog. But itrsquos a beautul day and every time we turn round, wersquore rewarded with that view: the point where Scotland stops and the Atlantic stars. How wild it is here, how wonderful.Therersquos a similar view all along the west coast of the peninsula, with glimpses of Gigha, all the way back to where wersquore staying at a BB in the little village of Glenbarr. Glenbarr Stores has rooms that are neat and comfy, but there are nice twists as well. For a start, the BB is connected to a small garden centre, cafeacute and shop, grouped round a courtyard, which gives it the atmosphere of a small community. The staff have prepared a couple of platters for us which show off local cheeses, and an awesome homemade tomato chutney which Irsquom desperate to buy and take home. We sit at one of the outside tables and enjoy our food in the sun.The manager who runs the BB and shops, Zofia, has introduced a few other little quirky touches, like the bedding which is made from the fleece of the small herd of alpacas she keeps on the farm she runs with her husband Paul. And the coffee, which is a blend she developed with the Argyll Coffee Roasters, who are based in Tighnabruaich. It is called Zofiersquos Coffee, and itrsquos part of the charm here: friendly, personal, uncorporate.The BB is also close to another of those views wersquore becoming addicted to. We walk down from the village past the extraordinary and empty Glenbarr Abbey which the locals tell me was never an abbey and has never had a monk anywhere near it but I never solve the mystery of its name. Further on is Killegruer Beach, a long stretch of sand that seems to have stolen the sun from somewhere hotter. A little bit further on is another handsome beach, ArsquoChleit. It is our private place today the dog chases sticks the sea chases our feet and the guillemots and the gannets provide the soundtrack.And so to the east coast of the peninsula, which provides a dferent view. Here, we are looking back over our shoulder at where we came from. We head to the village of Skipness and the seafood eatery there. Itrsquos early evening, the sun is lingering and we sit at the tables outside with Arran casually providing the most dramatic of backdrops. We can also see Skipness Castle, where there is all the usual history of ruins: the fate of kings, in this case James VI, and the end of wars, in this case the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in the th century, and, naturally, a ghost, in this case the Green Lady. But mainly, itrsquos about the food, and the wine, and the view.The following day, we eat our way south, ending with cake at the Muneroy tearoom in the village of Southend. The cake is homemade again and itrsquos a great clf of sponge running with caramel. We munch it as we walk, fingers sticky with sugar, and follow the signs for another beach. Later today, we will have to reverse the process of a few days ago, and single track will become B-road, then A-road, then motorway. But thatrsquos later. For the moment: cake, beach, bliss.Mark Smith was a guest of Glenbarr Stores, BB, award-winning Cafe  Garden Centre, which is  minutes south of Tarbertand  minutes north of Campbeltown.

Agnes Henderson, , whorsquos popped down with her -year-old sister Emma Brander. Thirty-year-old Maureen Hume, a name you might have recognised in the s she was Scotlandrsquos womenrsquos badminton champion. And also there is -year-old mum Karen Fisher whorsquos left her two young kids with a neighbour so she can go out for some messages.In one of the shops on the precinct, Malcolm Campbell the fruit merchant, the -year-old shop assistant Shirley OrsquoBrien is speaking to the man from the Gas Board. For the last couple of days, people have been complaining about a smell of gas and the employee of the Gas Board has come to investigate. He tells Shirley therersquos nothing to worry about.Outside, more workers from the Gas Board have arrived and are digging holes in the road to seethey can find out whatrsquos wrong. Theyrsquore being watched by -year-old Cyril Ewart from the window of the Castlebank laundry on the other side of the street. Cyril doesnrsquot know why, but he has a strange feeling as he stands there at the window surveying the scene: the workers, the shoppers, the No  bus.It happens two minutes later. At .pm. There is a loud rumbling sound. Then a bang. The windows of the laundry and other buildings are blown in. Glass everywhere. Cyril runs out into the road, but the air has filled with a dark cloud of smoke and dust. He canrsquot see a thing. Hersquos struggling to breathe. Through the dust he can hear people screaming and calling for help.The smoke clears to reveal the disaster. Ten of the shops in the precinct are gone, reduced to rubble. A man comes staggering over the stones. Itrsquos -year-old salesman Thomas Henderson. Thomas had been parking in the car park on the roof. All he remembers is an awful bang and the roof giving way underneath him. His car slithered down on to the rubble but Thomas managed to get out and clamber over a pile of bricks and stone and metal and reach the pavement. It was one of the most remarkable escapes that happened that day: Thursday. October st, .Others are trapped. Like Shirley OrsquoBrien, the shop assistant who was told by the Gas Board that there was nothing to worry about. ldquoThere was a rumbling and a bang and everything came down, she said. ldquoI was buried. Two men came and helped me out. She also remembers looking back and realising that there was nothing left of her shop it was gone.There were many other stories like Shirleyrsquos: people who were nearly killed or injured, around  in all. Then there were the people who never got out. Twenty-two people died in the explosion at the shops at Clarkston Toll in . Agnes Henderson and her sister Emma. Maureen Hume, the badminton champion. Karen Fisher, the young mum whorsquod popped out to get some messages. And  others, including Agnes Sands, a friend of Karenrsquos, a -year-old girl, Christina Wallace, and Etty Pattullo, we of a local sherf. John McDermott, , and Michael Freeman, , also died but mostly it was women. Young women. Young women with families.Exactly  years after the disaster, Irsquom speaking to Karen Fisherrsquos brother Neil MacPherson, who was  at the time and lived in Knightswood. He remembers the day he heard what had happened. It was a holiday weekend and hersquod just got home from school. His mum told him therersquod been an explosion in Clarkston. He remembers there were rumours it might have been an IRA bomb. ldquoI went to bed that night, he says, ldquoand my mother told me lsquoI donrsquot think yoursquoll see your sister againrsquo.In the end, Karenrsquos body was the last to be taken out of the rubble. Her friend Agnes had been in one shop and Karen was in another and because she was downstairs it took longer for the rescuers to reach her. More than  police officers and  fire-brigade units attended the scene, as well as every available ambulance in Glasgow. One by one, the casualties were taken to the Victoria Infirmary and Hairmyres, where every available doctor and nurse was called in for duty.Eventually, Neil and his parents and his three older siblings knew that Karen had definitely been killed. For a while, there had been some hope as the rescuers did their work. At one point, just a couple of hours after the blast, a policeman with a loudspeaker addressed the crowd of almost  that was gathered round the disaster zone. ldquoWill every person remain still, he said. ldquoDo not move. For five minutes, the firemen and the police anxiously listened for cries from the rubble. But there was silence. Soon afterwards, another body was located and taken from the ruins.One of the traumatic moments that Neil remembers most vividly is the phone call that came on the Friday afternoon. ldquoThere was a call that my father took asking for someone to go to Mill Street in Paisley where the mortuary was. My father, who was an exceedingly strong man, didnrsquot go ndash my two eldest brothers went and identied her. Eventually, the authorities also ed Karenrsquos personal effects which included her watch. ldquoYou might think they would clean it up, says Neil. ldquobut it was stained with blood. The watch had stopped at about  orsquoclock so my mum worried that was when she died.That thoughtless moment when Karenrsquos blood-stained watch was ed is just one of the things that Neil thinks would be done dferently nowadays. ldquoNo one would get away with anything now, he says. ldquoThere would be questions asked all day long for a week and that would set the tone whereas then it was a news incident, front page of the paper, and then no one saw any more about it. It would have been better organised and there would be better equipment and maybe they would have found more people faster ndash I donrsquot know.Neil also believes the inquiry that happened after the explosion was inadequate. A fatal accident inquiry was held but it concluded that no one was to blame. ldquoThe fatal accident inquiry concluded in about three months it would take about ten years today to get all the evidence and tests together now. My parents werenrsquot even asked to take part. How can you have a gas leak for a week complaining about the smell, the gas board there digging holes and whatever  and people walking past with cigarettes and god knows what  and not be to blame for it In the end, the conclusion of the experts answered some questions but not all. William Gibb, a forensic fire investigator and expert witness, pieced through the evidence and unearthed a fractured gas pipe under the pavement in front of the shops. The reason it had cracked is that it was insufficiently supported underneath so that when traffic was travelling past it, the ground was flexing slightly and that, combined with corrosion, caused it to crack. The gas from the pipe percolated through the soil and filled the large cellars underneath the shops and something then ignited it. Exactly what that was cannot be known for certain.Fty years on, Neil MacPherson sometimes worries that an accident like Clarkston might happen again. He, and other relatives of the dead and injured, are also concerned that there is still, in their view, no appropriate or sufficient memorial. I speak to Fiona Warrender, who was a schoolgirl at the time of the disaster and whose mother May Skellon was seriously injured. Fiona has campaigned for a proper memorial for many years and finally succeeded in having a memorial tree planted at Clarkston Halls. There is also a plaque at the shopping precinct. But itrsquos not enough, she says.Neil feels the same way and says he believes East Renfrewshire Council want to forget about the disaster and move on. The council tell me, however, that they are planning a minutersquos silence on the day and a special service at the memorial tree. Betty Cunningham, the deputy provost, says it was a dark day for Clarkston. ldquoMany lives were lost, she says, ldquoand countless more were changed forever, so it is extremely important that the day is marked and we remember those who were lost. The commemoration at the memorial tree will give the families of victims and the survivors an opportunity to pay their respects and the minutersquos silence will allow everyone to stop in a moment of reflection.As far as Neil and Fiona are concerned, however, it should be better, and a decent memorial is the least that can be done, in their view, for the people who lived through the disaster, and the ones that didnrsquot, and their friends and relatives. Neil tells me about the shock he felt. He was  years old. And he tells me about his mother. She never got over it. And his father, who hid the grief deep down as Scottish men often did in those days.Sadly, all these years later, no pictures survive of Karen but Neil remembers her vividly. He remembers the double funeral that was held for her and her friend Agnes. He remembers a policeman on the street taking his hat off and bowing his head. And  years on, he wants us to remember what happened to Karen Fisher and the other  people who were killed. And the men and women who were hurt and traumatised and shocked and survived by the skin of their teeth. This Thursday [st], it will be exactly  years since it happened. Another Thursday, like the Thursday in . .pm. A good time to remember.SidebarOn the October rd, , The Heraldrsquos Dorothy Grace Elder attended the scene of the disaster and wrote about what she found. Her piece is reproduced here:A tray of cakes and rolls still lay among the rubble in the shattered City Bakeries shop at Clarkston yesterday, a pathetic reminder of the everyday normality which exploded so horrically on Thursday.Yesterday Clarkston Toll was a place where local people moved around like automatons a community where everyone I spoke to used the word ldquostunned. What were once attractive modern shops lay like a deck of smashed concrete cards. Workers picked among the rubble, spurred on by the memory of other disasters where le had been discovered after hope was gone.But, at around pm, almost exactly  hours after the heart of this busy suburb was ripped out, an eerie hush fell on the scores of policemen, helpers, onlookers, and journalists. Another body had been found.There can be few sights more sad than that of an ambulance which does not hurry. Slowly, the cream vehicle backed up against a shattered shop and the crowd stood in heavy silence under the beating rain as a body wrapped in green tarpaulin was placed in the ambulance and the vehicle slowly nosed out through the crowd.The road from Glasgow to Clarkston Toll passes prosperous redstone villas and the green sweep of a fine golf course, and it is with a sickening feeling that one comes upon the aftermath of the disaster ndash the devastated shops the shattered glass in the gutters the huge lorries and rubble-removing equipment the massive hole outside a laundrette where Gas Board men toil in the mud and the tired, sad-faced policemen politely directing inquirersIt is now almost impossible to image this blitzed, tragic mess as being, such a short time ago, a promenade for shoppers and pram-pushers. Only a handful of shops remained open yesterday, where solemn-faced housewives quietly bought necessities.The tragedy has been particularly hardfelt by women, and there was the common thought among housewives I spoke to that almost anyone of them might have been ldquodown at the shops on Thursday afternoon.One shopper, Mrs Rae Fell, of Kirkville Drive, expressed the view of many when she told me, ldquoI would have been down hereit hadnrsquot been such a rotten day.

In other words, just % were classed as obstetric patients.In the third wave, from May  to September , there were  female ICU admissions with Covid, but this time  of them - % - were obstetric patients.None of these  women had been vaccinated, even with a single dose, despite appointments having opened to  to -year-olds in early May and  to -year-olds in late May.: What Israel tells us about boosters, waning immunity and Covid deathsUptake has been \"substantially lower\", as PHS put it, among pregnant women compared to the general population: of all the women who gave birth in August, just % had had a single vaccination compared, at the time, to around % of  to -year-olds and more than % of  to -year-olds.Some evidence from around the world has also pointed to increasingly severe illness in pregnant women as the virus has mutated - a pattern which appears to be borne out by the data in Scotland where the Alpha iant dominated during wave two before being overtaken by Delta in wave three.The third wave was associated with a steeper rise in Covid ICU admissions among people aged  to As SICSAG notes there \"were very few critical care admissions\" for obstetric patients during wave one - very probably fewer than five, in fact.By wave three, however, Scotland had seen \"increased numbers of pregnant women being admitted to hospital with moderate to severe Covid- symptoms requiring critical care\".Of these wave three mothers, % were of non-white ethnicityand % came from the most deprived areas.Groups, coincidentally, known to have lower vaccine coverage.On Monday, data for England revealed  of the  most critically ill Covid patients given extra corporeal membrane oxygenationbetween July and September were mothers-to-be, of whom  were unvaccinated and one had had a single dose.ECMO is administered when a patients lungs are so badly damaged that a ventilator cannot maintain oxygen levels.: Almost  fully-vaccinated Scots died from Covid after restrictions ltedAccording to Dr Sarah Stock, a consultant in maternal and foetal medicine who is co-leading a study into Covid- in pregnancy at Edinburgh University, being pregnant affects how the body responds to infections and \"this is probably what were seeing with Covid-\".Thankfully, no pregnant women in Scotland have died from Covid.But it seems clear that they have been let down by a toxic combination of confusion and misinformation which has understandably increased their hesitancy and left them under-protected as Delta - combined with a lting of restrictions - fuelled a surge in infections over summer.At the very least, much more needs to be done now to drive up coverage among expectant mothers, particularly as winter - and flu season - approaches."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12736278.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-campaign-events-play-major-factor-boosting-wellbeing-says-report","story":"It is just one of the findings of a report commissioned by VisitScotland and the Event Industry Advisory Groupto help to understand and examine how events continue to contribute to Scotlandrsquos wellbeing.The Contribution of Events to Scotlandrsquos Wellbeing report was delivered by Wavehill Social and Economic Research, and led by Dr Bridget McConnell, CBE and Chief Executive of Glasgow Le, which delivers culture and leisure services, as part of her role with the EIAG Health and Wellbeing Economy group.Read more:Glasgow needs an emergency funding deal to lt it out of crisis, say campaignersThe report also highlighted the social aspect of events is recognised as a key driver for supporting mental wellbeing.

It said the association between cultural activities and wellbeing is well-established and that cultural activities provide opportunities for social engagement, enjoyment, learning, capacity building, civic pride, social solidarity and cohesion.The report said providing greater opportunity to access cultural activities will help to safeguard the wellbeing of people and communities, enabling them to cope better in times of stress including during the Covid- recovery.It added that investment in culture and leisure has the potential to stimulate local economic growth and reduce the financial burden on services, for example through improved educational outcomes, reductions in crime and anti-social behaviour and better physical or mental healthPaul Bush OBE, Director of Events, at VisitScotland welcomed the report saying: \"The findings from this research and the recommendations on how to develop the evidence base for measuring the contribution of events to the nationrsquos health and wellbeing, will form an important part of our work going forward including building it in to our National Events Strategy, Scotland the Perfect Stage.\"Jenny Gilruth MSP, Culture Minister, said promoting a Wellbeing Economy was a top priority for the Scottish Government.Ms Gilruth said: \"As this report has highlighted, the erse range of events that take place throughout the country bring social and economic benefits to our communities.

A pupil at New Stevenston Primary School and Bellshill Academy, he did his undergraduate degree at Glasgow University, which was the foundation for ldquoeverything I have become as a scientist and a person.My husband, Professor Sir James Mirrleeswho was born in Minnigaff, Galloway, would have agreed, going to primary school in Newton Stewart and Douglas-Ewart High School. He depended on bursaries and prize money to pursue an undergraduate degree at Edinburgh University.Richard Hendersonhas a similar story ndash attending Newcastleton Primary near Hawick, Hawick High and Boroughmuir High in Edinburgh, before an undergraduate degree at Edinburgh University.To date,  Scots have been awarded Nobel Prizes since they were inaugurated in .According to Richard Henderson, this is  times greater than the world-average per capita, with only Switzerland and Austria coming close.In , a year after the Nobel Prizes were established, Sir Ronald Ross, of Shandwick, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on malaria. He is the grandfather of the current chief of Clan Ross. Since Ross, Scots have been awarded Nobel Prizes in every category except Literature, although the great Gaelic poet Sorley Maclean was nominated for that in .In the past nine years, between  and , there have been eight Scottish Nobel Laureates, an achievement for a country that has a small population of about . million people.In one year alone, , four of the Nobel Laureates were Scottish. All these achievements should have been a cause for national celebration.David MacMillanrsquos award spotlights the fact that Scotland has been very successful in producing Nobel Laureates but has failed in giving them national recognition.Alfred Nobel in Scotland and the  Scottish Nobel Laureates are a valuable part of Scotlandrsquos heritage that has been overlooked for too long. Celebrating Nobelrsquos Scottish connections and our Scottish Nobel Laureates would raise Scotlandrsquos image as a hub of science and discovery and encourage young Scots to realise that everything is possible ndash that there are no limits to their potential.So what can Scotland do to honour its Nobel Laureates  Here are a few suggestions: l create The Scottish Nobel Fund to help finance a series of initiatives to highlight the achievements of the Scottish Nobel Laureates and the le of Alfred Nobel in Scotland l have a permanent display area dedicated to the Scottish Nobel Laureates in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.In , a portrait of my husband was presented to the Gallery. On show for only a few months, it was put in storage for a decade. It was displayed again in December , after his death that year.Sir Mervyn King, former governor of the Bank of England, at the unveiling of Jimrsquos portrait pointed out: ldquoThis Gallery is the worldrsquos first purpose-built portrait gallery, opened in  and championed by the historian Thomas Carlyle, who wrote that lsquoHistorical Portrait Galleries far transcend in worth all other kinds of National Collections of Pictures whateverrsquo. Scotland led the way and continues to do so.After the death of Scottish Nobel Laureate David Thouless in April , collecting the portraits of all the living Scottish Laureates became a priority.The Gallery had commissioned portraits of some of the Scottish Laureates when the coronavirus pandemic put everything on hold.When Jim received the Nobel Prize in , he said he was both delighted and a little embarrassed at all the attention. Jim had an exceptional mind, and he was also exceptionally modest ndash embodying the values of small-town Scotland where you worked hard and lived without ostentation.Only after Jimrsquos death, I found in an old file box marked ldquoNobel stuff a pile of letters he had received when the Prize was announced. Among the ldquoNobel stuff, was a letter from Margaret Wilson, an old classmate at Douglas-Ewart High. She wrote: ldquoWas it really August  that my mother told me on the evening of my first day at school that you would be the Dux of that yearrsquos intake and added, lsquothat boy will go farrsquo  This bewildered me ndash I did not realise she was talking in terms of what you would achieve academically. I thought she meant you might go to the United States.Another idea would be to have an interactive display in one area of the National Museum of Scotland.Jimrsquos Nobel medal will go to the National Museum, which has been displaying the Nobel medals of Sir Alexander Fleming, Sir James Black and Lord John Boyd-Orr on three dferent floors in glass cases.Instead, feature all the Scottish Laureates in one area using audio visual technology, interactive display boards, photographs and medals,donated. The recent Scottish Laureates could record their stories in their own words. Scottish actors could narrate the history of those deceased. That way, Scottish children and other visitors could learn more about the Laureates and their discoveries.Few of the Scottish Laureates have blue plaques in Scotland. Several, such as Sir Alexander Fleming, are honoured by them in England. Dr David Hannay, chief of Clan Hannay, has organised with the Galloway Preservation Society for a blue plaque to be placed on the cottage where Jim was born in Minnigaff.Letrsquos create an ldquoAlfred Nobel in Scotland Centre with a guided tour of the Ardeer Peninsula in Ayrshire.We should reopen Irvinersquos The Big Idea, closed in , as the Nobel in Scotland Centre, focusing on the le and work of Alfred Nobel and his vast factory at Ardeer ndash which employed , people at its height ndash his le in Scotland, and his legacy of the Nobel Prizes, showcasing all Nobel Laureates and highlighting the Scottish ones.Alfred Nobel took out a British patent for his dynamite in . Failing to start a factory in England, Nobel, in April  ndash  years ago this year ndash established his British Dynamite Company Ltdat Ardeer with the backing of John Downie, the general manager of the Glasgow firm, Fairfield Engineering and Shipbuilding Company. The records are in Glasgow University archives.In a letter to his brother in , Nobel wrote: ldquoPicture to yourself everlasting bleak sand dunes with no buildings. Only rabbits find a little nourishment herehellip It is a sand desert where the wind always blows often howls filling the ears with sand. Between us and America, there is nothing but water ndash a sea whose mighty waves are always raging and foaming. Without work the place would be intolerable.Other parts of Scotland have a connection to Nobel. Some of the rock powder required in the factory process was found in Skye and Aberdeenshire. Nobel bought the Westquarter Chemical Company, near Falkirk, to produce detonators and established another nearby at Redding Moor to supply that with fulminate.He also acquired facilities at Irvine harbour to export his explosives. He bought, as his base in Scotland, Hawthorn Cottage,  Polmont Road, Laurieston, from his chief chemist George McRoberts. It is still standing.As well as the centre, visitors could have a guided tour of the ruined site of the Nobel factory on the Ardeer Peninsula and explore its areas of bioersity.To celebrate this, surely day tours for visitors to the National Museum of Scotland, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, the Alfred Nobel in Scotland Centre, the site of the old Ardeer factory and the Ardeer Peninsula. This would be a boost to Ayrshire tourism, which already attracts visitors to the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum at Alloway and Culzean Castle.Annual lectures could also be established, one for universities and another for schools, to be given by a Nobel Laureate of any nationality in Scotlandrsquos seven cities in rotation.Finally, why not have a Nobel Laureates woodland  Wangari Maathaiplanted a tree when she learned she had been awarded the prize.The Nobel Laureates should be a source of national pride and all have left a legacy that should be remembered for ever more."},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire-bulls-southern-knights-ready-super-6-champions-tussle","story":"Watsonians were the dominant force in the inaugural Super season, before it was declared null and void in response to the Covid pandemic in March , and they started this campaign in the same impressive form when they beat the Bulls at Millbrae in round one back in early August.However, a combination of injuries to key players and others moving on to the pro game meant the Myreside men fell away during the second half of the season, although they did manage beat a depleted Bulls team last weekend then hold off a late Stirling County surge on Friday night to claim a third-place finish.The Bulls and Knights, meanwhile, grew stronger and stronger over the course of this season, securing their position as the top two teams with one round of matches still to play.

I believe that they are two very well-matched teams, and it will be on a kne-edge again this weekend. So, we need to stick to our gunswe want to come out on top.The playing surface this afternoon will be similar to the G pitch the Knights now train and play on at The Greenyards, but MacArthur doesnrsquot see that being a decisive factor in the oppositionrsquos favour.ldquoYou donrsquot let the pitch change your team and the way you want to play rugby, he reasoned.ldquoYes, they are fairly used to it, they train on it and will understand how it feels under foot, but we have the ability to train on G pitches down by us.The conditions will hopefully be better today than they were a fortnight ago, but it is unlikely that this will facilitate an exhibition of champagne rugby.ldquoBoth teams have got some really strong, dynamic players, concluded Knights head coach Rob Chrystie. ldquoItrsquos going to be a bit of a battle.

Once the buses arrive we’ll do some final preparation to get them ready for driver training and use on our services on the island.”Chair of OIC#s development and infrastructure committee, councillor Graham Sinclair said: “It’s hugely gratying to see these four buses arrive in the county, the first of many more which will bring modern, accessible and low carbon buses to the county for the benefit our residents, including school pupils, and visitors.“This is the result of a lot of hard work by officers of the council, in the lead up to the contract being awarded, to explore the ious options for the county and steer us through procurement to what is a cost effective and environmentally advanced solution.“We look forward to the rest of the fleet arriving over coming months and to exploring, with the operator and with funders, possibilities in coming years for tapping into Orkney’s vast renewables potential and bringing on board green hydrogen and electric powered buses.”OIC’s transportation manager, Laura Cromarty, said: “We are delighted to introduce the first of the new fleet to Orkney and look forward to promoting and encouraging the use of public bus services again”.The buses are expected to begin operating on routes across Orkney week commencing Monday, October .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I thought it might be fitting for the bell to be recommissioned and used again in remembrance of the  lives lost.”Towards the end of , Bill contacted a local craftsman and friend, Richard Wilson, and askedhe could help. It had been hoped to have the clapper made and fitted ready for the anniversary in , however plans had to be delayed due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Richard carried out online research and was eventually able to get inside the Cathedral to measure up, acquiring the bronze for the clapper proved dficult locally so he had to source it online.“It took me around a fortnight to make the clapper in my shed at home mostly using a hobby lathe and a CNC router,# said Richard.#I was a bit taken aback when Bill asked me to do this for him. Obviously, it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be asked considering the history of the ship and the lives lost during the sinking.#Hopefully this clapper will be around for years to come and will be used to commemorate the event each year.”However, this was only half the tale. The clapper needed a tassel — a rope that someone would actually hold to ring the bell.Fran Hollinrake is the visitor services officer and custodian at the cathedral.She said that, having attended several commemorations over the years, her and her husband Andy became friendly with a couple, John and Tracy Welch.John’s father, Stoker Petty Officer John Welch, was on board HMS Royal Oak the night she sank, but he survived.His son, John, was a rigger in the Tyneside dockyards, and spent much of his working le working with ropes, but ill-health prevented John from making the tassel.Instead he passed the job on to his former apprentice and friend Paul New.John and his we Tracy arrived in Orkney this week and were present at the unveiling.John said of his father#s experience on that fateful night: #The night of the sinking he was on deck having a cigarette when the explosion happened. He managed to get off the ship and into the water and was picked up by the Daisy II.#He said he had held on to another chap in the water who was in dficulty,  as he was an excellent swimmer and had medals for le saving and water polo, but when they were both pulled aboard by the crew of the Daisy unfortunately the other chap had died. He was lucky to escape with burns to his hands and face.#After medical attention I think a week or so later he was sent back to Portsmouth to join another ship.“As I far as I can remember he never ed to Orkney, but after the war attended the reunions in Portsmouth on a regular basis. As for his feelings about that night it wasn’t something he went into in great detail, but he did say thathe could get back on the ship he would know exactly where his gold lighter and cigarette case were.#Representing the council, who maintain the Cathedral on behalf of the people of Orkney, Councillor Stephen Clackson also has a personal connection to the Royal Oak, having tragically lost his uncle Ronald George Clackson when the ship went down.He said: “My Uncle Ronny was the closest sibling in age to my dad and his favourite brother. He was very technically minded and joined the Royal Navy on July , , aged ¾, for ‘  ’ years.#After training at the shore establishment HMS Victory, he was posted to the recommissioned HMS Royal Oak as an ordinary seaman on June , , when the ship was expected to be embarking on a -month tour of the Mediterranean.#Looming hostilities set the course of the battleship in another direction, and by August she was in Scapa Flow. My uncle was reported missing presumed killed when the Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes from the U- in the early hours of October , just a week after his th birthday.#The news was devastating for my grandmother, whose brother had been killed on the Somme in World War I at the same age, and she never really got over it.

Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4156276.jpg--.jpg?1634197334000\n","title":"st vincent de paul member roadshow visits ballymena","story":"THE Society of St Vincent de Paul has hosted a series of Member Roadshows, visiting towns and cities across the province, to engage with members in person for the first time since March last year.As well as providing representatives of more than , members from  SVP Conferences across Northern Ireland with an overview of the Society and how it has responded to the tens of thousands who have needed its support most in the past  months. Together with its plans for Christmas  and beyond, the events provided delegates with an opportunity to meet Mary Waide who was elected Regional President for the North Region at the beginning of the pandemic.Following opening prayers and a welcome by Mary Waide, regional board members of SVP took to the stage to present ious aspects of the Society’s work to assembled guests representing their local SVP Conferences.Following a thought provoking spiritual reflection, board members presented the Society’s retail strategy for its  Vincent’s shops in Northern Ireland, a report of the outreach into prisons, details of how each Conference should report on its finances and new ways of adhering to policies and procedures for those being assisted by the charity and those providing the assistance.An interactive element encouraged guests to engage in a healthy discussion with board members before closing prayers. Mary Waide, Regional President of SVP North Region, said: “I am absolutely delighted with the success of this series of SVP Member Roadshows and the feedback from those who were able to attend.It was important for the SVP regional board to get out into our local communities having had such a long time apart from our members face to face. The focus of the roadshows were to primarily express our gratitude to our members for the sterling work they have been continuing to do on the ground to help those who have needed it most, during the most trying of times, and to share with them our SVP vision for the longer term. “The dedication of members of SVP has never been more important than it has been in the past  months. I know from experience how daunting it has been trying to help the vulnerable in our community without compromising or risking the health of those who are supporting those in need. As we move forward, it is my hope that our Conferences in County Antrim continue to go from strength to strength under the guidance of Frederic Ozanam who founded SVP almost  years ago.”SVP is an international charity and the largest voluntary charity in Ireland. SVP members in Northern Ireland work in all communities to support people whatever their background, who are experiencing poverty and social exclusion, promoting self-sufficiency and working for social justice. Every year SVP spends approximately pound million to help those experiencing poverty in Northern Ireland. Last year, SVP responded to tens of thousands of calls for assistance from members of the public.

Columba is a figure as multi-faceted as his names are numerous, be it Columba, Colmcille or Columb. googletag.cmd.push This year marks the ,th anniversary of the birth of one of the patron saints of the island. Columba, who was a prolic founder of monasteries, is credited with founding the city of Derry upon the rocks that mark where Long Tower Church stands today. However, Columba was not merely a meek monastery founder but someone who exhibited the courage of his convictions in stories as wide ranging as confronting Pictish tribes in modern-day Scotland to immersing himself in transcription and the reproduction of manuscripts. With Columba as its patron, St. Columb’s College will stage a year of celebration in honour of the momentous anniversary of Columba’s birth.     A Mass, celebrated by Bishop McKeown, on June  this year marked the start of this year of celebration that will culminate on June  next year.. The celebrations will entail the celebrating of Columba in his totality from Columba the scholar to Columba the seafarer to Columba the warrior, to name but a few. St. Columb’s College is inviting members of the public to its inaugural event on Friday, October  next at :pm in St. Eugene’s Cathedral Church Hall, Infirmary Road.  Dr Stephen Kelly.  Nathan Thiruvengadam, from the Colleges Columba Committee, said: “We are delighted to announce that Dr Stephen Kelly, past pupil and recipient of the Queen’s University Student Union Award for most iInspir- ing motivating teacher in both  and in , will be delivering a talk titled: Calves and Kindles: St Columba and the History of the Book. “Dr. Kelly, who is the author of the upcoming Imagining History in Medieval Britain, as well as co-editor of Betwixt and Between: Place and Cultural Translationand Imagining the Book , will walk us through the questions: Can it be true that St. Columba left Ireland over a book  Why was the act of copying St Finnian’s Psalter such an affront  What was a Psalter anyway, and how did it come to represent such a powerful instrument of cultural prestige and political authority  The talk will situate the Cathach of St Columba within the context of late classical and medieval ‘book culture.’ It will argue that the book is the most signicant technological innovation in Western culture, while also suggesting that the book and its metaphors continue, even in a digital age, to shape profoundly our under- standing of memory, history – and ourselves.” “The event is open to all be you young or old an expert or a novice on the background of our city’s founder- all are welcome. “The event is free but email columba@ stcolumbscollege.org to con- firm your attendance. “Tea and refreshments will be provided after the talk.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan charged to court over County Derry murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Danny Lafferty was red carded against St. Patricks Athletic.

Columba is a figure as multi-faceted as his names are numerous, be it Columba, Colmcille or Columb. googletag.cmd.push This year marks the ,th anniversary of the birth of one of the patron saints of the island. Columba, who was a prolic founder of monasteries, is credited with founding the city of Derry upon the rocks that mark where Long Tower Church stands today. However, Columba was not merely a meek monastery founder but someone who exhibited the courage of his convictions in stories as wide ranging as confronting Pictish tribes in modern-day Scotland to immersing himself in transcription and the reproduction of manuscripts. With Columba as its patron, St. Columb’s College will stage a year of celebration in honour of the momentous anniversary of Columba’s birth.     A Mass, celebrated by Bishop McKeown, on June  this year marked the start of this year of celebration that will culminate on June  next year.. The celebrations will entail the celebrating of Columba in his totality from Columba the scholar to Columba the seafarer to Columba the warrior, to name but a few. St. Columb’s College is inviting members of the public to its inaugural event on Friday, October  next at :pm in St. Eugene’s Cathedral Church Hall, Infirmary Road.  Dr Stephen Kelly.  Nathan Thiruvengadam, from the Colleges Columba Committee, said: “We are delighted to announce that Dr Stephen Kelly, past pupil and recipient of the Queen’s University Student Union Award for most iInspir- ing motivating teacher in both  and in , will be delivering a talk titled: Calves and Kindles: St Columba and the History of the Book. “Dr. Kelly, who is the author of the upcoming Imagining History in Medieval Britain, as well as co-editor of Betwixt and Between: Place and Cultural Translationand Imagining the Book , will walk us through the questions: Can it be true that St. Columba left Ireland over a book  Why was the act of copying St Finnian’s Psalter such an affront  What was a Psalter anyway, and how did it come to represent such a powerful instrument of cultural prestige and political authority  The talk will situate the Cathach of St Columba within the context of late classical and medieval ‘book culture.’ It will argue that the book is the most signicant technological innovation in Western culture, while also suggesting that the book and its metaphors continue, even in a digital age, to shape profoundly our under- standing of memory, history – and ourselves.” “The event is open to all be you young or old an expert or a novice on the background of our city’s founder- all are welcome. “The event is free but email columba@ stcolumbscollege.org to con- firm your attendance. “Tea and refreshments will be provided after the talk.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan charged to court over County Derry murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Danny Lafferty was red carded against St. Patricks Athletic.

They will receive a National Trust voucher to the value of pound. Aine and John began growing their own food this year after signing up to the National Lottery funded Acorn FarmI can growproject which involves  local families being mentored by a horticulturalist in growing their own fruit and vegetables over an-monthperiod. googletag.cmd.push Participants have received raised beds, seedlings and guidance on how to nurture their plants. Primary one teacher, Aine Kivlehan, said: Weve never won anything before, so this is a lovely surprise. Its incredibly satisfying eating a meal with ingredients grown in your garden. My son John really enjoys it too and we both find its a great way to relax. Im hoping to set up a little gardening club for some local children in the coming months to pass on some of the lessons weve learned as part of the wonderful Acorn Farm I can grow project. We are just so delighted to be part of this and to be given the opportunity to do something so positive for our environment.     Having done a little bit of growing in the past, Aine was excited to see the Acorn FarmI can growprojects call out for interest to people in the Derry City and Strabane District area and signed up to be part of it. John really loves checking on the veg and watering the plants and Ive enjoyed getting some tips from the horticulturalist which Ive passed onto friends. Its lovely being able to lt something from your back garden and bring it into the kitchen to cook for dinner. It has been catching too with neighbours popping over to have a look and being inspired to give growing a go themselves. Mayor Warke congratulated the pair, saying, It fills me with pride to see a local family like the Kivlehans doing their bit for the environment and turning their hand to growing their own food. Not only is this a lovely bonding activity for families, but it saves money and helps our environment too, reducing our reliance on importing fruit and vegetables from farther afield. This helps cut carbon emissions and eases the pressures on nature. One of the positive things about the pandemic is how it has prompted people to connect to nature and start thinking about the journey of food and how we can become more self-sufficient and sustainable.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan charged to court over County Derry murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Danny Lafferty was red carded against St. Patricks Athletic.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan charged to court over County Derry murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Danny Lafferty was red carded against St. Patricks Athletic.

Doherty, was a French teacher at Oakgrove College, before a combination of ill-health and redundancy left him twiddling his thumbs at home. Being an aficionado of words, he decided to put those thumbs – and fingers – to artistic use and create the spoonerism series. googletag.cmd.push Spoonerisms derive from error in speech in which corresponding letters are switched between two words in a phrase. The label takes its name from Oxford Don and cleric, William Archibald Spooner who would regularly do this. Sean, who is of the same family that own the citys famous Doherty Meats, said: “I would always do crosswords in the newspapers and I do love words. Sometimes I would spoonerise stuff in my head.  Spooner tries his luck at running a coffee shop. Pic: Sean Doherty “I started noting them down andthey amused me, I would then create wee scenarios for them.     “To be honest, I couldnt draw to save myself and I am aware that the cartoons are less than professional. “I was running around trying to get quotes from people to have my cartoons done professionally but the cheapest quote I got was fty pounds a frame. “The wolves are not at the door, but I am on benefits at the minute. The house is paid for and my we is still working, but I still have two children at university so I cant be paying out that much for a professional cartoonist. “I have a couple of hundred of drawings already created. Even to produce a set of ten would set me back five hundred quid. “I did a google search and came across a teach-yourself-how-to-do-cartoons programme. I went on there and used that to create my spoonerism characters. “The original Spooner was a nineteenth century cleric so naturally, I made one of my main protagonists a cleric as well – a bit like the Father Brown character on TV. “The we character is the one who interprets the spoonerisms, the mistakes with a for flips sake what are you at  and so on. “The cartoons Ive done are very rudimentary but I think as Ive been bouncing along, I got slightly better at it.” As mentioned earlier, Doherty has suffered with ill-health over the last few years with two bouts of Non-Hodgkins Lymphona leading him to take a redundancy offer from Oakfield College and take a break from teaching. He added: “I have had a colourful health history. I have had a number of things over the last ten years. “Im a teacher by trade having taught French at Oakgrove College. I dont do that anymore having had to take my redundancy. “I had my large bowel removed and a stoma bag installed. I recovered from that and went back to work. A couple of years after that, I had massive seizures and was diagnosed with osteoporosis. I broke a dozen bones – including my hip and backbone. “I was in hospital for a month after that. I recovered, went back to work and then I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma cancer. That was around three or four years ago. “I was successfully treated for it. I was within a few days of being officially declared as being two years clear when I took ill again and found the Non-Hodgkins had ed. “When you get cancer once, your chances of survival are good. When you get it a second time, it can be bleak. “I was lucky enough to have a doctor who was fantastic. He got me onto a thing called Car T Cell Treatment in London. “Its a radical, new treatment, What happens there is they take a sample of your bone marrow and have it sent away to a facility the Netherlands, They convert the bone marrow to fight the cancer internally. “Unfortunately it makes you sick as a pig as you have no immune system. I was in hospital for quite a long time in London. But it was successful – so far, so good, touch wood. “I got sent back to Derry literally just before the pandemic. Im still classied as being clinically extremely vulnerable. “In the middle of all that, I was offered a redundancy from teaching. Being extremely clinically vulnerable and going into eight or nine classrooms a day with dferent sets of pupils is not recommended. “My plan A had been to work as a substitute teacher – and I would have got plenty of work being a language teacher. “But the doctor in London said to leave it until next April and then we could revisit that. For now, I was told that I was not to work as a teacher.”  Spooners Quadrophenia party takes a wrong turn. Pic: Sean Doherty While Doherty awaits for the doctors to give him the green light to resume his teaching career, the Spooner cartoons keep him busy and hopefully someone somewhere might offer him the chance to showcase his material to a wider audience. He said: “I do not claim to be some sort of great artist, but what I have managed to start doing is to give them a character, give them a continued presence and to visually represent a joke. “You might not go oh that is a wonderful cartoon there, but you might see the joke. If youre a wordy sort of a person, you will get the joke. “Of course some might not get the joke and find it funny but I do think there is a niche for spoonerism cartoons.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan charged to court over County Derry murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Danny Lafferty was red carded against St. Patricks Athletic.

I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan charged to court over County Derry murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Danny Lafferty was red carded against St. Patricks Athletic.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan charged to court over County Derry murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Danny Lafferty was red carded against St. Patricks Athletic.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Oct Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  St. Patrick’s Athletic  Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe’s second half header was enough to earn Derry City their first win over St. Patrick’s Athletic at the fourth attempt this season. The striker struck midway through the second half to earn a big three points for the Candystripes in a dramatic encounter which saw both teams finish with  men. googletag.cmd.push Pat’s were on top for most of the game up until Junior’s goal, missing a series of chances in the first half alone. The visitors started the game on the front foot and almost got their reward when Sam Bone’s cross found Matty Smith, and his header beat Nathan Gartside but came back off the post. Matty Smith then missed when one on one with Gartside, before Chris Forrester hit the crossbar. It was City though who took the lead on  minutes. There seemed little on when substitute Jack Malone’s pass sent Jamie McGonigle racing down the right, but the striker produced a sensational cross right into the heart of the area for Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, who simply had to nod City into a lead they had not been threatening.     The game exploded into drama on  minutes when Ronan Coughlan, on the pitch just  minutes, was red carded for elbowing Ciaran Coll. Danny Lafferty, already on a yellow card, was also sent off for his part in the melee which followed the elbow, with both team playing the final five minutes down to  men. Pat’s, still searching for an equaliser, came so close to a goal in the aftermath, but were denied by a brilliant double save from Gartside, who parried Matty Smith’s shot and then reacted to save from Benson as Derry survived again.

Conor has dabbled in open mike nights over the years with great feedback however found himself struggling to find the confidence to next the next step into the world of gigging. googletag.cmd.push However, after multiple lockdowns, playing his acoustic guitar within the confines of his home, he took plunge and into the world of gigging and hasn’t looked back since. Conor’s book is open for bookings for weekday and weekend slots throughout the Northwest Like most of us, Conor’s le grinded to a halt during COVID. Not being able to do the things he loved he decided once again to wipe the dust off his old guitar and give this singing thing a go. Luckily for Conor his work from home schedule at times wasn’t overly demanding so he found himself homing in on his guitar skills between meetings.     He credits both his music and his love of the outdoors for keeping his sanity throughout the winter lockdown of . A keen swimmer, Conor found himself using the cold water, taking regular dips in Enagh Lough throughout the week to stay present and focused, alleviating the worries and uncertainty that gripped the nation during COVID times. Coming out the far side Conor sees exciting times ahead for himself. “COVID had really made me realise that the most important thing in le is to do the things that really get me excited. “Le is short and tomorrow it could be gone, so don’t take anything for granted. “I’ve discovered my love for music and live performing and this is something I really want to peruse. The buzz from singing your heart out on stage to be received by a rapturous applause is something I can’t get from any other areas of my le. “It’s amazing, something needs to be experienced to fully understood.” Smallmint Smallmint hail from ious parts of Northern Ireland, a collective of musicians shaped by their years of service to the music scenes of Belfast, Glasgow and beyond. Fronted by Andrew Cameron-Braithwaite, they confidently wander the border between Indie Rock and Americana — sounding like a long overdue meeting of the minds of Pinegrove, Frightened Rabbit and Julien Baker AND THEY release “Where We All End Up In The End” on October . The album will be released in its entirety on Bandcamp on  October, followed by single releases on DSPs each month thereafter. To give listeners a taste of the album, smallmint will perform a streamed album launch gig on  October and release the fourth and final single ‘Pseudonym’ on DSPs on  October. I don’t know for sure but I’m going to say that DSPs are download streaming s. Hot Press have said The layered production, melodic guitar hooks and enthralling dynamics come together to form a striking and powerful sound and they know a thing or two. The Last Mixed Tape have said A well-crafted piece of songwriting, the bands sound moves dynamically with each twist in the song’s tail”, but I don’t believe they’re the actual last mixed tape and Chorblossom have predictably said Drenched in dreamy Americana vibes, Liv is a superb second single from smallmint, I’d love to see them rip into someone meself. ‘Where we all end up in the end’ began le in , when live tracking commenced at Smalltown America Studios in Derry. Smallmint worked closely together with producer Caolaacuten Austin to achieve the sound on the record. Frontman Andrew Cameron-Braithwaite wears his emotional intricacies on his sleeve through his vocal delivery and upfront lyricism, all set to a musical backdrop of crunchy electric guitars and pounding drums. The result is a confident statement of intent — a testament to the band’s hard work, musicianship, and their own high standards. He said: “We wanted the album to feel natural and to actually sound like a band playing live in a room, which is exactly how it was recorded. It was important for us to keep that space and energy in the recordings - no need for overproduction or too many overdubs, we wanted to let the arrangement of the music by the band, and the lyrics speak for themselves.” Check them out on facebook smallmintband or instagram smallmintband or even www  smallmintbandADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan charged to court over County Derry murder overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Danny Lafferty was red carded against St. Patricks Athletic.

at half time.Downpatrick were desperately unlucky not to find the back of the net just minutes into the second half,as McGrady ran clear of the defenders after a looping ball over the topseemed to have caught Clonduff napping.With lsquokeeper Gribben already off his line, he made the decision to challenge McGrady in an aerial dual that the Downpatrick number  managed to win.However, his slapped effort over the head of the Clonduff custodian clipped back off the post and backinto the possession of the grateful Yellas.A minute later and the Hoops were back threatening the opposition defence, but Clonduff held firm when Branniganrsquos lsquorsquo effort dropped into the danger zone.Barry OrsquoHagan punished the Hoops for not taking their chances as his free sailed over the bar, before Downpatrickrsquos Oran Cunningham saw his effort drt wide at the other end.Charlie Carr extended his sidersquos lead with his second point of the game, although Tim Prenter managed to keep the RGU in touch with a no-nonsense score.McConville restored the margin with a left footed strike before his free pushed his side further in front.Darren OrsquoHagan showed no signs of slowing down as he began bossing play with piercing runs and cute passing, allowing the Yellas to put a foothold on the game.Doherty saw his free drt wide off the mark before Close punished the Hoops with a finely taken point to close out the action before the second water-break.Downpatrick knew the clock was against them, but they werenrsquot quite at panic station yet, as Brannigan converted yet another free after teammate Sean Bell was fouled.Clonduff midfielder Ross Carr pointed immediately after before Brannigan once more replied with a free.However, Darren OrsquoHagan began the move that would decide the match, after a string of neat passes and clever off the ball movement allowed his brother Barry to nip in behind the Downpatrick defence before calmly slotting home into the bottom right corner.The now six-point advantage truly seemed to deflate the Downpatrick side who now knew it would take something very special to force extra-time.Despite a Brannigan free, McConville wrapped up the scoring with a lovely left footed strike to ensure it was his Clonduff outfit who would enter the semi-final draw.This signalled the end of the road for the Downpatrick men, who gave a great account of themselves in this yearrsquos competition.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney , A Doherty, R Murphy, S Bell, J Bell, C Doherty , D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter , G Collins, C McGrady , J Brannigan , O Cunningham, C Mooney.Subs: T Smyth, P Turley, A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, T Louden, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, G Trainor.Clonduff: P Gribben, J OrsquoHagan, D OrsquoHagan, T McEvoy, L Branagan, C Carr , J Gribben, R Carr, A Carr , T Close , P OrsquoHagan, B OrsquoHagan , A McConville , S McConville, E Brown.Subs: N Trainor, C Brown, R Brannigan, S McGreevy, P Lively, R Lively, T McGreevy, B McConville, P Wilson, J Boden, M McPolin, K OrsquoHagan, F McConville..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Co.jpg","title":"Co Down Rural Community opens new hub in Newcastle  ","story":"THE Co Down Rural Community Network has opened a new wellbeing hub in Newcastle.The new facility is intended to be a central point in the resort to make it easier for people to access information, advice and support and participate in activities to improve their mental and physical health and wellbeing.It will work with iniduals, community members, local groups, and multi-disciplinary teamsto identy community needs and facilitate better access to mental health and wellbeing training and resources.The opening of the new hub is the culmination of the Community Network working with local GPs and primary care teams and the wider community for over  years.Over the past three years, the network has linked up with the MDTs in the local primary care practices.The network has a team of social prescribers and an MDT coordinator who take referrals from GP practices, pharmacists and from other sources and find solutions for people who may be affected by physical limitations or mental health issues or who simply feel isolated in their own homes.This work has intensied during the Covid pandemic, making the opening of the hub even more timely.A total of  people have been referred by the local GPs and their teams to the Community Network since January this year in addition to the  clients that the Social Prescribing team have been working with since .Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who officially opened the news hub on Monday, has described it as a ldquogreat asset for the Community Network team and those who formerly operated a connect and chat service.ldquoGroups of all sorts now have a base to operate from in a beautul and peaceful location.

The project manager Mr Mike Gibb, said Delamont had always been his first option but he could no longer afford to wait on the council.Mr Gibbrsquos announcement dashes hopes that the centre, which is destined to become the largest owl and birds of prey rescue facility in Europe, would come to Killyleagh.Mr Gibb had entered negotiations with Down Council last year regarding the possible construction of the sanctuary at Delamont.But the project became the subject of controversial debates within the council chamber earlier this year amid accusations that council officials were dragging their heels about the proposal, leading Mr Gibb to look for alternative locations.CLOUGH ndash Residents opposing plans for the erection of a BT Cellnet mobile telephone mast in Clough have formed an action group to try and block the plan.At a meeting in the village on Monday, residents got together after they heard local environmentalist, Walter Graham, outlined the drawbacks and health risks associated with these masts.Plans for the -metre mast which,approved, will be sited within the Watsonrsquos filling station complex, were published several weeks ago andaccepted could be operating within months.Up to  residents gathered in the Old School House, just a stonersquos throw from the proposed site, to hear of the risks and implications these masts are believed to cause.Villagers heard how the transmitter could dominate the skyline, towering over homes, a primary school, petrol station and an old peoplersquos home.Claiming that scientists believed the growth of cancers were ldquospurred on by the transmitters, he said. ldquoIf this mast goes up my children are coming out of school, there is no way they will study in the shadow of that mast.

That was understandable in March , but needs to be addressed now.ldquoThe simple inadequacy of the emergency ambulance response times in this area is also a matter of grave concern. We recognise that a major element in that service failure is the y ambulance handover times that can occur at the hospitals with the centralised services.ldquoThat was to be dealt with under the Department of Healthrsquos ldquoNo More Silos document, published a full year ago. Why has that still not been addressed  he asked.Veteran hospital campaigner, Ann Trainor, has welcomed news in a letter from health officials that they are ldquoactively working on improving so-called point of care testingcapability at the Downe Hospital, which should signicantly increase service delivery in the urgent care centre.ldquoThis is good news, she continued. ldquoWe hope that progress on this will be very swt and perhaps the South Eastern Trust could explain why we are still waiting on an MRI scanner at the Downe too ldquoHoneyed words wonrsquot increase the diagnostic capability of our local hospital, one which has so much to offer on a regional basis too, but swt action will. The Trust told us recently that the urgent care centre is lsquomeeting the needs of the publicrsquo but one really has to wonder how this opinion has been formed, said Mrs Trainor.Appealing for increased investment at the Downe site, health campaigners say that the hospital has the capability to do much more.The say the hospitalrsquos bed capacity must be extended to help meet the needs of local communities but also to help address the regional beds shortage caused by the large cut in capacity across Northern Ireland ldquowhich has been brutally exposed during the Covid crisis.The campaigners added: ldquoThe South Eastern Trust should now be looking at a large extension to the hospital, creating new capacity, away from over congested centralised sites, levelling up rural inequality in healthcare provision. That work must be done now and urgently and hand-in-hand with the creation of new medical workforce capacity.ldquoIt is time to build for the future and it is time for all the political parties to vigorously pursue this new investment for the Downe, the peoplersquos hospital.

The idea is to visit a iety of locations in the months ahead.At the same time as some were having a leisurely lsquocupparsquo, three EDAC members had donned their red and yellow vests ready to take on the Cooley Coast K in Carlingford.Patrick Smith reported back that the weather was kind, the first eight kilometres was gentle and almost flat, but the last two gave them their moneyrsquos worth with a steady climb back to the finish line at the Cooley Kickhamrsquos GAC grounds.He managed to complete it in a time of .which put him in well inside the top half of the field of .Kelly Smith was ahead of him up the road as she stormed to a . which took a full minute off her previous best time.She was fth female overall which should really boost her confidence to no end.

Well done Kelly.Aine Grant who has settled in well to the club was doing her first K since Jimmyrsquos Ten in June and was well pleased to finish in  minutes. They all said that they would recommend this as a race to others in the club.Aaron McGrady had another good day on the hills on Saturday. He seems to flourish when there is hardship.He was out wearing his EDAC vest with pride at the Bradwell Fell Race in the centre of the Peak District.Not an easy one as it comprises eight kilometres and m of climbing with a profile of three steep climbs early in the race, a rolling circuit for a few km on the fell top and then a final steepdescent to the village.The conditions on Saturday were misty and cool on the tops but good for running and helped by a well marked course.The race set off fast into the first climb and Aaron settled back in and around tenth, hoping to work his way forward on the climbs.Over the top of the first climb, there were three main contenders with Aaron one of them.He took the lead on the way over the second climb and managed to put in a hard burst over the top and down the second descent.When he couldnrsquot hear the sound of the others breathing, he knew he had created a good gap so he relaxed a little on the third climb to gather some energy for the loop on the top.He was reasonably confident that he had built about a  second lead when he reached the final descent, but he gave it a good rattle anyway crossing the finish line with well over a minute to spare.Great pacing and a pleasing result.This weekend sees the Cross Country season taking the headlines with the NI Mastersrsquo Trials at Queenrsquos Playing Fields.Entries for this are now closed but those who are taking part will be vying for selection for the upcoming Home Countries event in November.Plenty of others will also be planning some off road training in order to prepare for the Bobby Rea XC which is the week after.It is great to see some recent recruits adding their name to the team entry and hopefully they will enjoy their first experience of lsquothe muckrsquo.

Three minutes later the visitors had their first effort when from Casey Courtneyrsquos long throw, Christopher McKay headed back to Courtney but his enterprising effort was wide.Villa should have been ahead in the th minute but Aaron Carberry produced an outstanding double save.The game was being played at a frantic pace with both midfields battling for supremacy with Jon Joe Sharvin and Darren McConnell linking to produce an outstanding pass for Jack Sharvin but his effort was well blocked.Soon afterwards there was almost a repeat with McConnell and Barry Walsh linking, and Jack Sharvin flashing the ball across the six yard box.Killyleagh were playing some neat football with Jonny Murray and Jon Joe Sharvin combining for Jamie Sharvin to almost thread it through for Declan McComiskey. There was time for Jamie Sharvin to stride forward and try a long range effort.The visitors have made an outstanding start to the season, reaching the quarter finals of the Steel Cup, and they knocked the ball about with confidence as they had their best spell of the game.A free kick from the impressive Arthurs was cleared for a corner in the th minute and then, six minutes later, first Jamie Sharvin blocked the effort from McKayrsquos knock down, and Jonny Murray cleared a clever short corner as Thomas Dickson prepared to strike.At the opposite end twice before the interval Jack Sharvin went close, first with a free kick on the far left and then he had an effort cleared off the line in the nd minute but in truth both teams were very evenly matched in the first half.Killyleagh took control in the second half with a midfield masterclass from Barry Walsh and Darren McConnell in particular, and McComiskey having a lot of joy down the left side. After  minutes they were awarded a penalty when Jack Sharvin was fouled in a clumsy challenge from Courtney inside the box.However, Sharvinrsquos spot kick was brilliantly saved by Andy Wallace.Four minutes later and Wallace produced heroics again, this time a save with his feet from Sam Carson after McComiskeyrsquos pace had again exposed Villa.The goal was coming, though, and it was goal of brilliance. Jack Sharvin curled the ball round his marker Hylands from the edge of the box and into the stanchion of the goal in the th minute.It was a goal worthy of winning any cup tie, at any level. For a long time it looked asit would.Killyleagh had half chances, after this, with Walsh again winning his midfield tussle with Dickson to set up Jon Joe Sharvin and then Jack Sharvin went even closer from brother Jamiersquos free kick. Villa had half chances too at the opposite end with Jake Wilson going close to an equaliser.Then came that dramatic finale. Wilson was presented with a second chance in the box after his initial effort was saved and he produced a stunning finish high into the net from a tight angle.Cue th minute pandemonium and it seemed the tie was set for extra time.But when the game was restarted Killyleagh won a corner and after two blocks at close range the ball was eventually scrambled over the line by Jon Joe Sharvin in the th minute.The huge crowd contained several former players from the first Killyleagh team to win the Border Cup in  and now Paul Sharvin will be hoping his team get a chance to match that Christmas glory.To reach the semi-finals, however, they must beat Crumlin United on November  ndash a chance to avenge an incredible - defeat when the teams last met in this competition exactly two yearsrsquo ago when Killyleagh tossed away a - half-time lead in the last nine minutes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Slieve.jpg","title":"Slieve Donard sold for £40m  ","story":"NEWCASTLErsquoS iconic Slieve Donard Resort and Spa has been sold in a poundm deal to American investors.Owned by the Hastings family since , the world famous five-star hotel has been acquired by US-based AJ Capital Partners which is planning a major upgrade.After weeks of speculation that the hotel had been sold, the news was finally confirmed last Thursday with the new owner a Nashville-headquartered real estate developer and hotel operator with more than  hotels across the US and Britain, including St Andrews in Scotland.Announcing that the Newcastle hotel has been acquired, AJ Capital also confirmed that renovation work is planned to start in October next year, with the work completed by the following spring.During the planned upgrade, the hotel will remain closed.Howard Hastings mdash the managing director of Hastings Hotels mdash described AJ Capital Partnersrsquos acquisition of the Slieve Donard Resort and Spa as ldquoencouraging news for hospitality and tourism in Northern Ireland.He said it also represented a boost for the burgeoning golf tourism industry which ldquohas been an important driver of local tourism in recent years and shows signicant growth potential in the future.Mr Hastings added: ldquoI have every confidence that AJ Capital Partners will be sympathetic to the heritage of the hotel and that, under their leadership, it will continue to flourish and maintain its reputation as an iconic destination in Northern Ireland.ldquoThis investment is a strong sign of confidence in the local market by a major international hotel operator with exciting ambitions for the Slieve Donard in the coming years.

Concerns came not just from across the political spectrum but from groups including the Rural Community Network.”He added: “I am glad Nichola Mallon has taken this action, eventhe problem should never have arisen in the first place.”Sinn Fein MLA Cathal Boylan, meanwhile, have also welcomed the u-turn.“This was the right decision as the Minister’s plan was clearly out of step with the needs for rural communities,” he said.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But I recall from that brief exchange how charming and polite he was, and how humble in the face of a mereconstituent.Much later I interviewed Mr Amess in the Westminster area, albeit briefly. I think this happened twice, when I was doing surveys of Tory MPs and their attitudes to the  Obama-McCain US presidential election and later in the run up to the  Brexit vote.I am not sure where one of those encounters happened — I think I approached him as he was walking in the street along the side of the House of Lords — but I have a clear recollection that he was smiling, as he had been in .He always seemed to be smiling.This might sound like typical praise of someone after they have died but it isn’t. Because I can think of many people I have encountered, among them politicians, who I do not associate with smiling at all.A devout Catholic, Mr Amess was plainly a highly conscientious person, still

They are horrible, liable to crack your jaw and I remember a now long dearly departed aunt repeatedly sucking on them at church, and offering me one to sweeten a tedium I knew could only be endured with stony faced compliance.There is no amount of sexy or stylish or slick advertising, not even a nationwide campaign with Kate Moss sporting one between her teeth, that could bring back the butter ball in any way that would ever make it fashionable or appealing again to those beneath octogenarian status.

I would rather drink Night Nurse or Benilyn than endure the pain and bitterness of the so-called Fisherman’s Friend, the confection that basically rips your throat out.The lozenges were originally developed by pharmacist James Lofthouse in  to relieve ious respiratory problems suffered by fishermen working in the extreme conditions of the Northern deep-sea fishing grounds.Really  Because I feel that I have incurred a respiratory problem anytime I have made the mistake of ingesting one.The lozenges of horror are relatively unchanged since their creation.

Please try again later.Submitting...Head of the English department of Strathearn Grammar, Wendy has the idea for her first short story while regrouting her bathroom floorMany of them are weary and the cityscape comes to reflect this in instances of pathetic fallacy one character observes the concrete jungle as tired, “like it can’t be bothered with the afternoon either and longs for the shutters down”.She writes of characters like Mo, who did fortune telling while working at a call centre before opening a beauty parlour that is subject to paramilitaries hounding her for protection money of a bigoted teacher who objects to Celtic place names and won’t eat green sweetsof the fictional rockstar Gil Courtney for whom the Troubles are utterly irrelevant the couple obsessed by their niqab-wearing Somali neighbours and of hilarious insights into teenage besties Cath and Lauren.People stare out of their windows or go on meandering walks peering aimlessly into shop windows. Or they collect online vouchers for cheap meals at restaurants with inconvenient time constraints. This is the stuff of real le, people doing their best to cope in situations of searing isolation or emotional constipation, grieving, love-lorn, waiting for a triumph that doesn’t come, grappling with disappointment that arrives devoid of sugar-coating. Wendy with her daughter Mathilda, . The author and teacher regards motherhood as her proudest achievementNot that Erskine doesn’t do humour, she does with gusto, but she also “wants people to be moved” by her precise rendering of all the absurd tragicomedy of le as it is lived every day.Erskine, an avid fan of “s girl groups, New Wave and psychedelic music” who gets a glowing . out of  on the Rate My Teacher website for her role at the prestigious east Belfast institution that boasts alumni such as Margaret Mumfordand novelist Lucy Caldwell, dismisses the notion that the ordinary lives of the people of her native city are somehow not rich enough to make appropriate thematic material for fiction.“Somebody might say ‘Oh, you write stories about ordinary people.’ And my response is, yes, but who are these extraordinary people you are talking about  “Because strip away status and artice and we are all ordinary people. Plus, once you get to know ordinary people and understand their lives, they become extraordinary, inidual, special and just as worthy of literary analysis as some powerful hero or heroine.”Erskine, who has a massively high score on the Rate My Teacher website, has just been appointed a fellow of the Seamus Heaney Centre at Queens University Belfast. She is delighted by the opportunity to help fledgling writers improve their creative effortsShe continues: “People ask of my writing, “Is everything going to be set in East Belfast ’ As though people who live in London have lives that are more complex or more exciting, by virtue of the fact that they live in a big metropolis, whereas I really do think I could write collection after collection about people who live on streets here similar to the one I live on. I think their lives are just as rich as any.”So too does she deride the notion that local fiction has some kind of moral imperative to focus on the  years of conflict that so disturbed our peace. Erskine believes that the literary imagination should have unbridled permission to roam free through whatever territory it is intent on exploring: “If you come from Northern Ireland you have an absolute prerogative to write about whatever you wish, whether that is the Troubles, the post-Troubles landscape or novels about turtles or about people playing the guitar or about landscape gardeners. “There shouldn’t be any expectation about what you decide to write about. ANGEL FACE: Wendy as a baby, long, long before literary fame beckoned“With me, what I’m thinking about is that there is no sort of homogenous Northern Ireland le where you live or whatever social class you come from doesn’t mean that your experience is any less worthy of exploration or any less profound.”She is interested in characters on the margins navigating lives that may seem nondescript from the outside, but are charged with an emotional valence, poignancy and levity so that, as Erskine intends, “people may laugh, but I also very much want them to be moved. I could write a story that is simply funny ha-ha, but that would not be true to the complexity of human experience. “In the same way to centre my literary focus solely on melancholy would also be to deny that le is an absurd tragicomedy composed of darkness and light. To go back to Blake, “joy and woe are woven fine”.“That is very much the philosophy behind the fiction I try to write.”‘QUIET STOICISM OF ULSTER PEOPLE COMPELLS ME’Erskine’s first foray into creative writing began when she was offered an afternoon off amidst her hectic schedule as head of the English department at Strathearn Grammar.Though tempted to “join the gym, volunteer in an art gallery or mooch around coffee shops reading magazines or watching make-up tutorial videos on YouTube which I endlessly love,”, she saw a Facebook ad for a six-month writing course at the Irish Writers Centre, a lofty Georgian edice on Dublin’s Parnell Square, run by The Stinging Fly magazine. She committed to it in  after submitting a story named Locksmiths, the idea for which came to her while regrouting her bathroom floor and stripping away the layers of paint and wallpaper left by previous owners of her home.It is about a woman engaged in the optimism of a DIY project while the Troubles rage on her doorstep: “I’m interested in people on the side-lines, those who aren’t the centre of attention, the lives quietly lived. There are plenty of characters like that in the collection. Quiet stoicism compells me.” ‘I LOVE THE CITY, CONCRETE, TOWER BLOCKS, STREETS, BOOKSHOPS AND MARGARITAS’Wendy had a happy childhood, and with her brother would be taken to the library once a week by their mother,who kept “random” books in the family home in Jordanstown.She inherited her mother’s love of reading, and delighted in creative writing exercises at Belfast High School, situated between Whiteabbey and Greenisland: “We used to be given a Mars bar at the end of the classwe did well, which was absolutely blissful for me.”She went on to study English at university in Glasgow before going into teaching there and then in Newcastle Upon Tyne before relocating to home, sweet home.“I always wanted to study English, because reading was my thing more than anything . I think Hemingway said that ‘the good parts of a book may be only something a writer is lucky enough to overhear, or it may be the wreck of his le, and one is as good as the other.’”Though she is a dedicated teacher who delights in her colleagues, pupils, the discussion of literature and a school she loves so much she has stayed for over two decades, as well as a much feted writer of short stories, Wendy considers her greatest achievement to date as being mum to her two children Mathilda,  and son Bobby, , whom she shares with art teacher Paul, whom she met on herto Belfast in .“I’ve never found parenting stressful, it’s been more like this joyous voyage into uncharted territory and I am very proud of the fact that my children have grown up to become two lovely human beings,” she confides.The secret to her longevity with husband Paul “Spending substantial time apart and having separate interests as well as being able to totally enjoy each other’s company. You need to be self-sufficient iniduals as well as a couple.”And despite being an enormous bookworm, who especially adores the Russian master of the short story Anton Chekov, Wendy is also something of a fashionista who stocks clobber by The Vampire’s We, Isabel Marant and western shirts in her wardrobe as well as a panoply of finds she bought on Ebay for next to nothing. Then too, when not looking cooler than any teacher has a right to in pencil leather skirts with choppy-cut silvery hair and flicky eyeliner, she loves nothing better than wandering through her native Belfast: “I love concrete. I love tower blocks and streets, browsing in bookshops and going to a nice old bar with lots of red velvet for margaritas.”QA: ‘I’D HAVE MARY SHELLY, GENE CLARK AND LOU REED TO DINNER’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories Hearing my Mum and Dad have a conversation about how they didn’t think The Beatles were that good. Also, trying to bang an Ormeau Easter egg on the side of a chair to break it open to get the little fluffy plastic chick that was inside.School days - what subjects did you excel at and were you ever in trouble Not surprisingly, English was my favourite subject and I always loved it. I don’t think I was a real goodie-goodie though, I always liked make-up, eyeliner, back combing my hair and wearing a lipstick I remember that used to change colour. So I would have got into trouble sometimes because of my attempts at aesthetic improvement, for sure.Who in your le makes you laugh the most Probably my Mum who is . She’s very funny and has a very particular wit and original way of looking at the world. She’s very aware of the ridiculousness of things.Who is your best friend My husband of over  years, Paul.Some of your favourite books The Sound and The Fury by William Faulkner, Sea State by Tabitha Lasley and The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison.Favourite film Once Upon A Time in the West, directed by Sergio Leone.If you could invite anyone from history to an ideal dinner party who would you bring and what would you serve them I would % have Mary Shelley. Then Gene Clark from The Byrds and The Velvet Underground’s Lou Reed. I’d serve a great big plate of nice breads and cheeses and meats so that I could sit and enjoy their company with minimal effort, although I think Mary Shelley was vegetarian, so no meat for her.Can you describe yourself in three words Disciplined, frivolous, observant.How much do you enjoy teaching I’ve worked at Strathearn since  and that is an indicator of how much I love the place. It’s the kind of job where every day is dferent, and there is always something interesting going on. I love the discussion of literature above all.You’ve recently been made a fellow of the Seamus Heaney Centre at Queen’s. What does this mean to you Before I began to write I’d always loved reading other people’s writing, first as a student, then as a teacher. Being a writer can be lonely, so what I really look forward to is being able to help writers, whatever their age or background, find a way to improve their creative endeavours. To collaborate with somebody on making a piece of creative writing as powerful as it can be will be a huge privilege for me.Love is...Essential.The meaning of le is...Not always apparent.Dance Moves by Wendy Erskine will be published by Stinging Fly and Picador in February ."},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/13109186.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLeaving the main car park and tramping pavements along Heol Gorllewin to pass the Prince of Wales pub, which features in the tale of the Maid of Sker, the group then entered the southern part of the vast Kenfig Burrows. These burrows were once part of a huge dune system that stretched all the way from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula and this area along with Kenfig is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest.With the dogs racing ahead enjoying their adventure and freedom, the narrow sandy paths adorned in places by the pretty Michaelmas-daisy led them through the burrows before turning southwards towards the coast.Reaching Kenfig Sands where the tide was on the ebb there were fantastic views south westwards towards Jersey Marine, Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower beyond as they settled down utilising washed up tree trunks as seating for morning refreshments in warm sunshine with a welcome breeze.Returning onto the coast path above the beach the group made their way eastwards to reach Sker Point with its fantastic long-distance views back across Kenfig Sands, spoiled only by the industrial smoke and buildings of Port Talbot Steelworks.Following the coastline soon the yellow painted Sker House came into view which signalled their lunch stop overlooking Sker Rocks which was the setting on April , , when the Samtampa a former Liberty ship was making its way up the Bristol Channel towards Newport in a south westerly gale. Developing an engine fault, the captain dropped anchor so repairs could begin, but the weather worsened to hurricane force winds, the ship slipped its anchor and was driven onto Sker Rocks. Mumbles leboat was launched to try to save the crew, but the Samtampa began to break up and all  of its crew drowned, along with the eight volunteer crew members of the Mumbles leboat which was later found upside down and smashed to pieces.     Continuing along the coast path with views across Rest Bay to Locks Common in Porthcawl and reaching the western perimeter of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, they ventured inland following a narrow path between fences, with a field of beautul Welsh Black cattle as the heat rose, before an open field brought them through a gate into Nottage.A short journey along the busy and fast-moving West Road brought them to a rough track opposite Parc Newydd Farm, which led them to overlook the impressive, imposing and dramatic Grade One listed Sker House, which was originally founded by the Cistercian monks of Neath as one of five farms or granges to support Neath Abbey. The house was remodelled by the Turberville family in the mid-th century after which it was tenanted and then sold to the Williams family in the late th century.This was when the romantic, heart rendering story of the lsquoMaid of Skerrsquo began involving Elizabeth Williams, an attractive young lady who loved to dance in the old Town Hall above the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig, where the music was supplied by a harpist.One evening the harpist was Thomas Evans and upon meeting they were smitten and fell in love. For a while he courted her, but her father was against the union as he felt being the daughter of a successful landowner and farmer, Thomas Evans was beneath her as he was a mere carpenter and so he imprisoned her in Sker House.The couple tried to elope, but their plans were thwarted and until Elizabeth agreed to marry her fatherrsquos choice of husband - Thomas Kirkwood of Neath - she was not freed. They married and had four children settling in Briton Ferry, but it was an unhappy liaison andher true love was playing in the area, Elizabeth would sneak out to hear him play. She died in , it is said of a broken heart, and was buried at Llansamlet, but her unfulfilled and unhappy ghost is said to still walk at Sker.Following a track and crossing part of the Pyle and Kenfig golf course brought them back to their start point after what had been a delightful scenic and interesting tramp through history in stunning weather for the month of October.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

With all things considered, officers recommended the delivery of option two.The rural towns officers included in the report are Donaghcloney, Keady, Richhill, Tandragee and Waringstown.DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter proposed the officers’ recommendation to go with the festive drive in experience and said “it would be very welcome, especially in those rural communities”.Councillor Paul Berry welcomed the proposal but noted Markethill was not included in the list of towns mentioned and proposed it was included.Council’s head of economic development services, Nicola Wilson confirmed Markethill could be includedcouncillors want.Noting Council has a duty of care to the general public, Councillor Kyle Savage seconded the proposal to accept the recommendation and praised council officersfor “taking and showing true leadership” with this recommendation.Noting he was happy to go with the proposal for the festive drive-in, despite public health regulations relaxing further at the end of October, Councillor Sam Nicholson said he would second Cllr Berry’s proposal to include Markethill in the proposal.“I support Cllr Berry’s call to include Markethill. It is one of our most thriving and vibrant market towns,” he said.“If Councillor Berry is making a proposal to include it, I am happy to second it.”Alderman Ian Burns said he was fully supportive of the proposal but called for the towns of Gilford and Rathfriland to also be recognised.Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon said he would prefer to see twilight markets in the rural towns but with the movie night proposal he would want to ensure that “providing it can be worked into costs, it is run in as many of our rural towns as possible”.Alderman Jim Speers said he had discussed this issue “at ” with Council officers and acknowledged the need for as many places as possible to get an event like this.“I am very supportive of the need to have this event in Markethill butwe do that in one place other towns will feel they have been short-changed.“I have already had that conversation with officers and I would like to see us get to the point where this is rolled out across the area.”The committee then voiced its approval for Councillor Baxter’s proposal to recommend the movie night and free Christmas Eve car parking is approved and Cllr Berry’s proposal to incorporate as many smaller towns as budgets will allow.Read this:- Driving tests ‘crisis’Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

tips for safe student accommodation ","story":"With freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
