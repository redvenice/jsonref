[{"url":null,"title":"Heatwave 2018 UKs hottest summer record","story":"    Wimbledon fans queue for tickets for day two of the tournament. This year’s Wimbledon Championships could have one of the hottest days everChief Meteorologist, Will Lang, said: ‘The heatwave conditions will continue to affect pretty much all parts of the UK over the next few days.‘Although peak temperatures may not be quite as high as we have seen this week, we will still see temperatures widely in the mid to high 20’s  with 30C or more still possible across southern and some central parts of England.’However, that is still a few degrees short of the hottest temperature recorded in the UK.That honour goes to Faversham in Kent in 2003. On August 10, the hottest ever temperature in the UK was recorded there, hitting a mighty 38.5C.The summer of 2003 was an incredibly hot one, with Scotland’s Greycook recording 32.9C one day earlier. It was the hottest temperature ever recorded in Scotland until June 28, 2018.That summer wasn’t the hottest overall, however. That title goes to the summer of 1976, where for 15 days towards the end of June, temperatures in all four nations topped 32C and Cheltenham recorded 35.9C at the start of July.In Dorset and Devon, no measurable rain fell for a staggering 45 days, which led to the passing of the Drought Act and water rationing.It is thought that temperatures will climb over the next two weeks, hitting 33C in the first week of July before potentially topping 35C next week.Dr Thomas Waite of PHE of Public Health England said: ‘It’s vitally important that we keep an eye on friends, family and neighbours who may be at risk.‘For others, the best thing to do is avoid the sun during the hottest parts of the day, carry water with you when travelling and if going out to large events, and we know lots of people will be watching football this week: think what you can do stay cool.’See here for more information on how hot the weather has to be for school and work to get cancelled. World Cup 2018: Bank of Russia jokes it predicted Russia\u0026#8217s victory over Spain on special currencyCalum Best calls for Love Island bosses to have more focus on mental health supportEngland vs Sweden football history revealed ahead of 2018 World Cup fixture on SaturdayPrince Louis christening: Who will Kate Middleton and Prince William invite?EuroMillions results: National lottery winning numbers for Tuesday, 3rd July 2018 drawWhen Kate Middleton will next wear a tiara revealedIndependence Day: How to keep your dog calm during July 4th fireworksBachelorette\u0027s Chris Randone shares photo of himself at age 13 when he was 230lbs... after another contestant said he used to be a \u0027fat f***\u0027Who is Kyle Edmund?

He knew he had potential and athletic ability. But you have to work hard to achieve that, and he has.\u0027He wanted to be in the first-team at 17 and was pushy, but I liked that.

It showed him queueing to pay for fuel and, as he did so, suddenly putting his hand on the shoulder of the woman in front of him for no apparent reason.He then walked forward to the alleged victim\u0027s till and could be seen almost immediately reaching out to the woman\u0027s chest area with his left hand. It was clear in the video that her own hands did not leave the counter.Mr Gough claimed she had moved her polo shirt aside herself so he could read the rest of her tattoo - but the CCTV clearly showed that did not happen and he said he could not understand why not. During yesterday\u0027s trial the court heard that the woman cashier in a Gloucester shoppetrol station had a two line sentence about love tattooed just above her right breast. She said it was positioned so it would be covered up by her work polo shirt and she would look \u0027professional.\u0027When Mr Gough approached her, she said: \u0027Hhis fingers went on my top and pulled it down and to the right.\u0027He pulled it across to reveal the full length of my tattoo. His fingers were on the skin of my chest.\u0027She said she asked if he was trying to read the tattoo but he just grinned and did not really respond and he did not question her about it.\u0027When he pulled my top across he leaned his head down and started looking at it,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was quite shocked. I didn\u0027t know what to do. I just wanted to serve him and get him out of the shop.\u0027She estimated his hand was on her for about five seconds.\u0027It was part of my breast - the top part of my breast, a personal place,\u0027 she said. \u0027When he did go my stomach turned. It made me shake. I felt really uncomfortable, I felt like crying. But I didn\u0027t want to make a scene in front of the customers.          After a half-day trial the magistrates said they believed the woman\u0027s account of what happened but could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Gough\u0027s actions were sexually motivated and so found him not guilty of sexual assault\u0027I turned to my colleague and said \u0027He just pulled my top across. Do you mind if I go?\u0027\u0027I felt overwhelmed and emotional. I contacted my mum and I burst into tears. I spoke to my manager and we decided to call the police.\u0027Cross-examined by Tim Burrows, for Mr Gough, she denied that he had asked her about whether the letters \u0027red\u0027 in the tattoo related to Manchester United or Ferrari. He said nothing of the kind, she insisted.Linda Mustoe, the woman in the queue in front of Mr Gough before the incident, told the court he stood quite close behind her and made her feel \u0027uncomfortable.\u0027\u0027Then I felt something touch me. It was a hand on my left shoulder,\u0027 she said. \u0027I quickly looked around and saw the man. He said sorry and moved back. \u0027She said while she was being served Mr Gough went to the next till and after he left she heard the cashier saying \u0027That man has just pulled my top down.\u0027\u0027She was distressed and I said, Actually, he made me feel uncomfortable too. He actually touched me.\u0027In evidence, Mr Gough said the woman\u0027s tattoo was up on her collarbone, not her breast, and he could only see the letters \u0027red\u0027 so he asked \u0027Are you Man U then, or Ferrari?\u0027\u0027She said \u0027Do you want to see it?\u0027 and I said \u0027I don\u0027t mind.\u0027 She pulled it to the side and she laughed.\u0027When I put my hand out I may have flicked her top, I don\u0027t know.\u0027After a half-day trial the magistrates said they believed the woman\u0027s account of what happened but could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Gough\u0027s actions were sexually motivated and so found him not guilty of sexual assault.\u0027She said he took hold of her polo shirt and pulled it across to reveal her skin - the CCTV revealed he did,\u0027 said court chairman Andrew Tabor. \u0027He denied touching her at all although grudgingly admitted he might have flicked her clothing. He claimed she opened her shirt to show the tattoo even though CCTV evidence showed her hands not to leave her till.\u0027We are satisfied he did indeed touch her to reveal her tattoo. That action could be perceived to be sexual but we are not convinced that the purpose was sexual.\u0027When the court declared Mr Gough not guilty of sexual assault he raised both hands above his head and said \u0027Correct decision, Sir.\u0027He insisted he had absolutely no sexual motive for what he did.\u0027I have taught 3,000 girls between the ages of 17 and 25 to drive - a total of 90,000 hours in the car on my own with them no problem, and now I get some cock and bull story. I\u0027m sorry, no way,\u0027 he said. Mr Gough appeared on Britain\u0027s Got Talent in May last year and set a world record by reciting the alphabet backwards in four seconds. He also tried to set a new record for telling the most jokes in one minute but dried up and fell well short of his 27 joke target.In 1999 the lifelong driving instructor set a world record after averaging 113 miles per gallon when he drove his car from Exeter to Gloucester.

Then: Pat\u0027s great-grandfather, Walter Taylor (pictured) and his wife, Ellen, bought the property (now on the market for £425,000) for £130 in 1918Their shop, part of which dates from 1663, sells food, wine and anything else one could need at short notice, oh, and ham sliced to order.Homemade cakes, too, that fly off the shelves — Pat out-sources cake production to her friend Tina Evans, admitting that her own efforts in this regard have been less than wholly successful.\u0027This is the heart of the community and we feel very much a part of people\u0027s lives,\u0027 says Pat, who still sleeps in the small bedroom she was born in.\u0027I will miss that.

Rod gets up at 5.30 and makes me a cup of tea. I get up at 6.30. Before this year, the last time we had a full week off was for our honeymoon, 36 years ago.\u0027But she still recommends the post office as an escape from modern life. \u0027It would suit a family who are looking for a change — it does take up a lot of time but there is so much to enjoy in the day. You are not going to die of stress here.\u0027Pat\u0027s great-grandfather, Walter Taylor and his wife, Ellen, bought the property (now on the market for £425,000) for £130 in 1918. Two years earlier, Walter had lost his left arm in a threshing machine accident and used to hold down books of stamps with the hook that replaced it while tearing them out with his right hand. Three postmen were employed — two on bikes and one on foot — and Walter inspected them each morning to ensure their uniforms were spotless.One of the three was a Mr Marshall, who was known to let the side down on occasion, his weakness for cider causing him to crash into ditches while delivering mail.          Family tradition: Walter and Ellen Taylor\u0027s daughter Doris and her husband George Saunders took over the management of the sub-post office in 1942Ellen died in 1941 at the age of 77 and Walter followed in 1944 at the age of 79 — he had been determined to stay alive to see D Day.In 1942, their daughter, Doris, took over the management of the sub-post office, running it with her husband, George Saunders. They were followed in 1950 by their daughter, Margaret, and her husband, William Westbrook.\u0027The village has more than doubled in size since I was a child,\u0027 says Pat. \u0027It was a slower world then, in the Sixties. Things like vinegar and pop arrived in big containers and you had to bring your own glass bottles to fill up.\u0027In some ways it was more environmentally friendly. People did not have so many cars and they did their main shop in the village — there were two grocers\u0027 shops and a butcher\u0027s, as well as the post office — and they grew a lot of their own vegetables.\u0027Now, everyone drives to Gloucester or Cheltenham to the supermarkets, or they have it delivered after ordering online.\u0027People come in today for things they have forgotten to buy on a big shop, but it\u0027s still a good business. And as a village we do like our bottles of wine.\u0027          Service: Margaret and William Westbrook became the third generation of the family to run the sub-post office in 1950Ashleworth was a place of work up to the Seventies, home to a big saw mill that provided the family\u0027s shop with plenty of custom. But with its closure the village transformed into a mainly dormitory settlement, residents driving to work in Gloucester, Cheltenham and beyond. In recent years executive homes have sprung up to cater to this new demographic.But today, home-working is becoming more common, a modern electronic incarnation of the cottage industries of the past.\u0027Quite a few people work from home now and they rush in with packages to send just before the last collection at 5.20,\u0027 says Pat.As older residents have died off, so younger members of old village families have moved away in search of jobs — and because of rising house prices. A four or five-bedroom house in Ashleworth can now cost £500,000.\u0027A lot of people stay behind their doors and don\u0027t take part in village life, which is a shame —although there is a group of newcomers who do join in,\u0027 adds Pat. \u0027And the primary school is doing well — it has only 40 pupils but it\u0027s brilliant. It is still a gentle way of life — Ashleworth isn\u0027t commercialised like the chocolate box villages in the Cotswolds. We are off the beaten track.\u0027And endowed with a brilliant old (and not kitsch) pub, the Boat Inn. Owned by the Jelf family since the 17th century (they like to keep businesses in the family in Ashleworth) it is named after a ferry crossing on the River Severn. Charles II was said to have used this service when escaping Cromwell\u0027s forces following defeat at the Battle of Worcester in 1651.Locals at the Boat Inn passionately hope the post office survives. \u0027Everyone goes in there — it\u0027s a real little hub,\u0027 says barmaid Jo Minter. \u0027There are quite a lot of older people in the village and it is very advantageous for them.\u0027The local post office is a staple of British life, but branches have dwindled from about 25,000 in the mid-Sixties to some 11,500 today, although that figure has remained fairly stable for the last decade.About 98 percent of post office branches are \u0027agency\u0027 outlets, operated by franchise partners, like WHSmith, or sub-postmasters, like the Riachs, who are independent business people. A small number of \u0027Crown post offices\u0027 are managed by the state-owned Post Office Limited, which was hived off from the Royal Mail. In return for Government funding, the Post Office is required to ensure that 99 percent of the UK population live within three miles of a branch, and 90 percent within one mile.As Crown and agency branches have been cut, \u0027outreach\u0027 services — mobile offices or pop-ups using church and community halls — have grown in number.If no one takes on Ashleworth sub-post office residents will have to travel two miles to a branch in Hartpury. Hard if you are elderly and restricted to the bus. Something else will be lost — a place to bump into each other, to swap news and simply pass the time. And there\u0027s the gossip, too.\u0027You have to let some stuff go in one ear and out the other,\u0027 says Pat. \u0027There are no great shockers, but all human life is here. I will miss talking to all the people every day — what\u0027s going on with their lives — but I\u0027m not going far.\u0027For Pat and her forebears, it will soon be Last Post.But, hopefully, a young family will take over, continuing a tradition that helps make Ashleworth a community, not just a place. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/21/4DE586B100000578-0-image-m-23_1530736021203.jpg","title":"A tale two heroes","story":"Harry Kane (right( is only the second England player to score in six consecutive appearances for his country — a feat last achieved by Tommy Lawton (left) in 1939There are similarities: both men came from Irish stock born into ordinary homes, both were successful youth players and both exhibited a genuine love of the game.

Miller...Star choreographer Dame Gillian Lynne who worked on Cats and...Share this articleLeonowens became a publishing sensation in the 1870s with two memoirs — The English Governess At The Siamese Court and its sequel, Romance Of The Harem.Her salacious and barbaric revelations about Siamese slaves and concubines shocked and titillated readers in Britain and in North America.She also claimed she became the king’s personal secretary, discussing foreign policy and how to deal with the European powers threatening Siam’s independence.When Mongkut died in 1868, his son and heir (her pupil) demanded an end to slavery and the humiliating tradition that subjects prostrate themselves before him — both aspects of Siamese culture that Leonowens had railed against.In her books she revealed that the king’s harem of 32 wives and concubines lived in an ‘inner palace’ guarded by 9,000 female slaves, officials and soldiers.But she claimed the harem wasn’t sufficient for the king’s prodigious sexual appetites — he annually purchased ‘choice’ Chinese and Indian girls for his harem.Leonowens described a ‘charnel house of quick corruption’ which was also home to ‘hiding vice of every vileness and crime of every enormity — at once the most disgusting, the most appalling and the most unnatural that the heart of man has conceived’.Those claims were roundly disputed by Alfred Habegger, author of an authoritative 2014 biography of Leonowens. He insisted life in the palace was not nearly so cruel or depraved as she made out.He says slaves were more like Western servants, even if they were tattooed with their owner’s name. As for the harem, he believes Leonowens was regurgitating exaggerated travellers’ tales and palace gossip.Besides, he added, skinny King Mongkut was hardly a macho Yul Brynner figure. In his late 50s by the time he met Leonowens, the king had lived most of his adult life as a celibate Buddhist monk — and is unlikely to have been the sex addict she describes.So why did Leonowens create such extravagant lies about the Siamese court? Aside from the obvious answer that it was good for sales, her biographer suggests clues lie in Leonowens’ own unhappy story, in which, having sacrificed her own financial security for love, she came to despise any system where women were sexual chattels with children arriving as if on a production line.Perhaps she hated the privileged king, her biographer speculated, because his life was so different to hers — she’d had to fight for everything, even to the extent of ‘inventing herself from scratch’.Far from being the upper-crust, boarding-school educated English woman that she claimed, Leonowens came from the wrong side of the British Empire’s tracks.A poor, mixed-race Anglo-Indian, Leonowens had never been to England. Raised in Bombay, she was considered a second-class citizen because of her colour.Reinventing herself, Leonowens eventually convinced everyone (including her grandchildren) that she had been born in Caernavon in Wales in 1834 to a Capt Thomas Crawford who died in the Sikh Wars, leaving his family in India.In fact, she was born three years earlier to a mother who was the offspring of a British army lieutenant and his Indian mistress.Her father was a London-born Indian Army private who died before her birth, and Leonowens was sent to a charity school for mixed-raced children in Bombay.Despite her lowly status, Leonowens could still have wed above her station as women were in short supply in India. Instead, she defied her family and married for love. Her husband, Thomas Leon Owens, was an army clerk with idealistic views and no money.After he left the army, the couple eked out a straitened existence, first in Western Australia, then on the Malayan Peninsula. They had five children, three of whom died, and Owens died in 1859. It was a very different tale to the one Anna Leonowens, as she later called herself, claimed about her husband.An army major, she said they lived in well-heeled St James’s, London, before moving to the East where he died in a tiger hunt.Rather than remarry, strong-willed Leonowens decided to open a kindergarten in Singapore, but life was still hard.Salvation came when she learned King Mongkut of Siam was looking for a qualified English teacher. This privileged position offered Leonowens the perfect chance to make her mark very publicly as an English lady — claiming her skin colour was the result of many years exposed to the tropical sun.Sending her older child to a London boarding school, Leonowens set sail for Bangkok in 1862 with her six-year-old son, Louis.Much of the grittier details of her life there were missing from the Rodgers \u0026amp Hammerstein musical for which Brynner won an Oscar.It was based on Anna And The King Of Siam, a 1944 book about Leonowens by Margaret Landon.Thailand — as Siam became in 1939 — was outraged by the mockery of its revered king as an autocratic buffoon, and to this day the musical and a 1999 non-musical version are banned there.Thai officials claim Leonowens probably never even met the king. But Habegger found correspondence showing the pair had heatedly discussed Thai slavery and Western free market principles.In the musical, Mongkut dies with Leonowens kissing his lifeless hand. But she left Thailand a year before the King’s death in 1868. However, at their final meeting, according to a witness, Mongkut acknowledged their fiery relationship and hoped she would come back. She never returned.Was there ever anything more between them? Considering how unpleasant Leonowens was about him in her memoirs, it’s unlikely she harboured romantic feelings.But years later — when she was living in Montreal and active in improving women’s education and getting them the vote — she told a friend the King had once given her a large diamond ring to symbolise his readiness to raise her ‘even to royal dignities’. True or false? Probably the latter.It’s difficult not to have a sneaking admiration for Anna Leonowens, who died, aged 83, in Canada, still insisting she was an English lady.A dogged survivor who managed to break through the repugnant racial barriers of the British Empire, she created a legend that will continue to delight audiences for years to come. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/05/04/4DEFA13D00000578-5919637-image-a-117_1530761039669.jpg","title":"New York leads Independence Day celebrations","story":"    Fireworks soared over New York City in the nation\u0027s biggest display to celebrate Independence Day, marking America\u0027s 242nd birthday          Fireworks explode near the One World Trade Center tower, center, during the Jersey City Fourth of July celebration, Wednesday, in New York          Fireworks soared over New York City in the nation\u0027s biggest display to celebrate Independence Day, marking America\u0027s 242nd birthday  Americans across the US celebrated Independence Day with backyard barbecues, parades and fireworks on Wednesday (pictured is the display in NYC)  From New York to California, July Fourth festivities ranged from the lively and to the lighthearted, with Macy\u0027s July Fourth fireworks and Nathan\u0027s Famous hot dog eating contest (the Macy\u0027s fireworks display in New York City)          With the New York City skyline in the background, fireworks explode during an Independence Day show over the East River           Spectators watch a fireworks display on the east side of Manhattan borough, as part of Independence Day festivities Wednesday           A person stands on top of an apartment building in The Heights neighborhood of Jersey City, N.J., to watch the fireworks           Resident in The Heights neighborhood of Jersey City took to their roofs to capture footage of the fireworks display in New York City           In New York, the Macy\u0027s fireworks show over the East River kicked off its 25 minutes of sparkle and ahhhh with the West Point Band and entertainers including Kelly Clarkson, Ricky Martin and Keith Urban on NBC\u0027s broadcastIn New York, the Macy\u0027s fireworks show over the East River kicked off its 25 minutes of sparkles and ahhhhs with the West Point Band and entertainers including Kelly Clarkson, Ricky Martin and Keith Urban on NBC\u0027s broadcast.More than a million people lined the streets, packed onto roofs and stood on their balconies along the banks of the East River to catch the 42nd annual Macy\u0027s Fireworks display this evening.At least 3,000 pyrotechnic shells, in 25 different colors, were fired every minute during the 25 minute extravaganza - all synchronized to patriotic tunes and watched over by 50 pyrotechnicians.At its height, the display reached 1,000 feet - three times higher than the Statue of Liberty.

But in the small mountain town of Silverton, in southwestern Colorado, the celebration was still on, including live music and a water fight with firefighters.

Miller...Star choreographer Dame Gillian Lynne who worked on Cats and...Share this articleLeonowens became a publishing sensation in the 1870s with two memoirs — The English Governess At The Siamese Court and its sequel, Romance Of The Harem.Her salacious and barbaric revelations about Siamese slaves and concubines shocked and titillated readers in Britain and in North America.She also claimed she became the king’s personal secretary, discussing foreign policy and how to deal with the European powers threatening Siam’s independence.When Mongkut died in 1868, his son and heir (her pupil) demanded an end to slavery and the humiliating tradition that subjects prostrate themselves before him — both aspects of Siamese culture that Leonowens had railed against.In her books she revealed that the king’s harem of 32 wives and concubines lived in an ‘inner palace’ guarded by 9,000 female slaves, officials and soldiers.But she claimed the harem wasn’t sufficient for the king’s prodigious sexual appetites — he annually purchased ‘choice’ Chinese and Indian girls for his harem.Leonowens described a ‘charnel house of quick corruption’ which was also home to ‘hiding vice of every vileness and crime of every enormity — at once the most disgusting, the most appalling and the most unnatural that the heart of man has conceived’.Those claims were roundly disputed by Alfred Habegger, author of an authoritative 2014 biography of Leonowens. He insisted life in the palace was not nearly so cruel or depraved as she made out.He says slaves were more like Western servants, even if they were tattooed with their owner’s name. As for the harem, he believes Leonowens was regurgitating exaggerated travellers’ tales and palace gossip.Besides, he added, skinny King Mongkut was hardly a macho Yul Brynner figure. In his late 50s by the time he met Leonowens, the king had lived most of his adult life as a celibate Buddhist monk — and is unlikely to have been the sex addict she describes.So why did Leonowens create such extravagant lies about the Siamese court? Aside from the obvious answer that it was good for sales, her biographer suggests clues lie in Leonowens’ own unhappy story, in which, having sacrificed her own financial security for love, she came to despise any system where women were sexual chattels with children arriving as if on a production line.Perhaps she hated the privileged king, her biographer speculated, because his life was so different to hers — she’d had to fight for everything, even to the extent of ‘inventing herself from scratch’.Far from being the upper-crust, boarding-school educated English woman that she claimed, Leonowens came from the wrong side of the British Empire’s tracks.A poor, mixed-race Anglo-Indian, Leonowens had never been to England. Raised in Bombay, she was considered a second-class citizen because of her colour.Reinventing herself, Leonowens eventually convinced everyone (including her grandchildren) that she had been born in Caernavon in Wales in 1834 to a Capt Thomas Crawford who died in the Sikh Wars, leaving his family in India.In fact, she was born three years earlier to a mother who was the offspring of a British army lieutenant and his Indian mistress.Her father was a London-born Indian Army private who died before her birth, and Leonowens was sent to a charity school for mixed-raced children in Bombay.Despite her lowly status, Leonowens could still have wed above her station as women were in short supply in India. Instead, she defied her family and married for love. Her husband, Thomas Leon Owens, was an army clerk with idealistic views and no money.After he left the army, the couple eked out a straitened existence, first in Western Australia, then on the Malayan Peninsula. They had five children, three of whom died, and Owens died in 1859. It was a very different tale to the one Anna Leonowens, as she later called herself, claimed about her husband.An army major, she said they lived in well-heeled St James’s, London, before moving to the East where he died in a tiger hunt.Rather than remarry, strong-willed Leonowens decided to open a kindergarten in Singapore, but life was still hard.Salvation came when she learned King Mongkut of Siam was looking for a qualified English teacher. This privileged position offered Leonowens the perfect chance to make her mark very publicly as an English lady — claiming her skin colour was the result of many years exposed to the tropical sun.Sending her older child to a London boarding school, Leonowens set sail for Bangkok in 1862 with her six-year-old son, Louis.Much of the grittier details of her life there were missing from the Rodgers \u0026amp Hammerstein musical for which Brynner won an Oscar.It was based on Anna And The King Of Siam, a 1944 book about Leonowens by Margaret Landon.Thailand — as Siam became in 1939 — was outraged by the mockery of its revered king as an autocratic buffoon, and to this day the musical and a 1999 non-musical version are banned there.Thai officials claim Leonowens probably never even met the king. But Habegger found correspondence showing the pair had heatedly discussed Thai slavery and Western free market principles.In the musical, Mongkut dies with Leonowens kissing his lifeless hand. But she left Thailand a year before the King’s death in 1868. However, at their final meeting, according to a witness, Mongkut acknowledged their fiery relationship and hoped she would come back. She never returned.Was there ever anything more between them? Considering how unpleasant Leonowens was about him in her memoirs, it’s unlikely she harboured romantic feelings.But years later — when she was living in Montreal and active in improving women’s education and getting them the vote — she told a friend the King had once given her a large diamond ring to symbolise his readiness to raise her ‘even to royal dignities’. True or false? Probably the latter.It’s difficult not to have a sneaking admiration for Anna Leonowens, who died, aged 83, in Canada, still insisting she was an English lady.A dogged survivor who managed to break through the repugnant racial barriers of the British Empire, she created a legend that will continue to delight audiences for years to come. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/05/04/4DEFA13D00000578-5919637-image-a-117_1530761039669.jpg","title":"New York leads Independence Day celebrations","story":"    Fireworks soared over New York City in the nation\u0027s biggest display to celebrate Independence Day, marking America\u0027s 242nd birthday          Fireworks explode near the One World Trade Center tower, center, during the Jersey City Fourth of July celebration, Wednesday, in New York          Fireworks soared over New York City in the nation\u0027s biggest display to celebrate Independence Day, marking America\u0027s 242nd birthday  Americans across the US celebrated Independence Day with backyard barbecues, parades and fireworks on Wednesday (pictured is the display in NYC)  From New York to California, July Fourth festivities ranged from the lively and to the lighthearted, with Macy\u0027s July Fourth fireworks and Nathan\u0027s Famous hot dog eating contest (the Macy\u0027s fireworks display in New York City)          With the New York City skyline in the background, fireworks explode during an Independence Day show over the East River           Spectators watch a fireworks display on the east side of Manhattan borough, as part of Independence Day festivities Wednesday           A person stands on top of an apartment building in The Heights neighborhood of Jersey City, N.J., to watch the fireworks           Resident in The Heights neighborhood of Jersey City took to their roofs to capture footage of the fireworks display in New York City           In New York, the Macy\u0027s fireworks show over the East River kicked off its 25 minutes of sparkle and ahhhh with the West Point Band and entertainers including Kelly Clarkson, Ricky Martin and Keith Urban on NBC\u0027s broadcastIn New York, the Macy\u0027s fireworks show over the East River kicked off its 25 minutes of sparkles and ahhhhs with the West Point Band and entertainers including Kelly Clarkson, Ricky Martin and Keith Urban on NBC\u0027s broadcast.More than a million people lined the streets, packed onto roofs and stood on their balconies along the banks of the East River to catch the 42nd annual Macy\u0027s Fireworks display this evening.At least 3,000 pyrotechnic shells, in 25 different colors, were fired every minute during the 25 minute extravaganza - all synchronized to patriotic tunes and watched over by 50 pyrotechnicians.At its height, the display reached 1,000 feet - three times higher than the Statue of Liberty.

The ship, nicknamed Old Ironsides, traveled to Fort Independence on Castle Island to fire a 21-gun salute, and the ship\u0027s commander also saluted the crowds gathered there. A Navy sailor on board recited the Declaration of Independence during the cruise. Crowds lined the streets in a Rhode Island town to see the nation\u0027s oldest continuous Fourth of July celebration. Begun in 1785, the Bristol parade typically attracts about 100,000 people to the seaside town. This year\u0027s was a scorcher with temperatures  near 90 degrees when the parade kicked off Wednesday morning. The sweltering heat even saw some marchers treated for heat exhaustion and taken off the route.However, the celebrations were a little muted in some Western states where the recent hot weather and wildfire danger forced communities to cancel fireworks displays. In Colorado, the wildfire danger forced some communities to cancel their fireworks. But in the small mountain town of Silverton, in southwestern Colorado, the celebration was still on, including live music and a water fight with firefighters. Aspen will have a fire-proof drone light display above town.Other fireworks shows also went ahead  in Denver, Colorado Springs and Fort Collins.

This year sees the annual AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme return, with new categories including the Women Entrepreneurs in Health Tech award, created to encourage and support women pioneering some of the most innovative health technology.It’s certainly not that women aren’t enthused by the world of technology. We’ve spoken to three finalists, budding health tech entrepreneurs – who happen to also be women – to find out about their experiences within the industry.BrightSign develops communication tech for children and sign language users. Its founder, Hadeel Ayoub, travelled with a team to South Korea during her PhD studies to take part in a global hackathon, entering a smart glove that translates sign language into text or speech. They won the competition, which led her to develop the technology further and create BrightSign.“The tech arena in general is definitely male dominated. In digital health specifically, when I take part in trade shows or give a talk in a conference, most often I am the only woman on the programme. I am not necessarily treated differently, but the look of surprise on people’s faces when I am walking to the podium, into a meeting or presenting my technology cannot be overlooked. My name doesn’t always give me away as a woman, so it has happened to me several times that I am mistaken for the assistant while ‘Mr Hadeel’ is coming shortly.”Although Ayoub is encouraged by the progress the industry is making when it comes to being more inclusive to women, she sometimes feels she can be treated like a box to tick.“I feel I have been invited to events so they can even out the numbers and check the inclusivity and ersity boxes. That’s a shame, because I would rather be included for my work, not my gender.“I have to say that in the past couple of months, I have been very happy to see other female names presenting, and CEOs no less. There are a few women in tech in London. We have joined together and meet up regularly to share our challenges and support each other.”Hsin-Hua Yu, known as Sheana, was inspired by her own experiences with scoliosis (curvature of the spine) to create Aergo, a low-cost, inconspicuous postural support system. Sheana, who graduated with a double master’s in global innovation design at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London, was motivated by a research visit where she met with young people who used wheelchairs but struggled to sit comfortably and maintain a healthy posture.“Students and carers complained about the social stigma caused by not being able to sit upright, which led to people excluding them from conversations or activities. This motivated me to create a solution that helps children to break free from the need for constant assistance and build their self-confidence,” she says.Despite her complex and life-changing work, Sheana feels she faces something of an uphill struggle to be taken seriously.“As a female founder, I feel I have more to prove in front of colleagues, investors and business partners. I find the medical industry is particularly male-dominated and this can sometimes be quite intimidating. I’ve learned that by being clear, firm and professional, people begin to look past my gender and see me for my abilities.”Sheana would like to see a more “inclusive” health tech industry in future.“I’d like to see health tech designing solutions for all members of society. A lot of health tech today focuses on the medical condition and not the person. This often leads to a solution that can contribute to prejudice and social stigma. I believe in creating tech that is accessible to a wider range of users because it has the power to transform lives, remove social barriers, and change perceptions of disability within our culture.” Before creating iBreve, Wahl was working at Google’s legal department in Dublin and Boston. While travelling with her co-creator in Rishikesh, India – known as the yoga capital of the world – the pair saw an opportunity to combine breathing techniques from eastern culture with the western world and its modern stresses.“The growing trend of mindfulness and the increasing popularity of wearables reinforced our endeavour,” says Wahl. “We decided to focus initially on women’s health and wellbeing. So we designed a beautiful and discreet wearable that attaches to the bra and helps to improve stress resilience by analysing breathing patterns with machine learning.”Wahl wants to inspire more women and more ersity as a whole in the tech world.“Inspiring more girls and women to join the tech world is going to contribute to this ersity and benefits society with better answers to the current big challenges we face. My time at Google and at iBreve showed me that working together with a erse team from different backgrounds and with different experiences is productive, insightful and fun.”She would encourage women wanting to break into the health tech industry – and the tech industry as a whole – to listen to their instincts and follow what comes naturally.“The most important thing is to believe in yourself and do what you are passionate about. Trust your instincts and share your ideas and passion with others.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies. That’s why AXA is driven to discover and support the inventors of the future with its Health Tech \u0026amp You Awards.

The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks \u0026amp Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending. A report out this week predicts nearly 70,000 high street jobs will disappear this year unless action is taken to reinvigorate town centres and revamp business rates.Calvetron, which sold clothing from 300 outlets in department stores such as Debenhams, House of Fraser, and M\u0026ampCo, called in administrators from Duff \u0026amp Phelps after struggling to cope with high costs and falling sales. Administrators had continued to trade while they sought a buyer but on Wednesday said no viable offers had been received.The closures mark the final demise of a business founded in 1972 by Jack Cynamon and Alan Green, tailors from the East End of London. In 1977 they used their names, with a French twist, to create the Jacques Vert clothing brand.The group, which was once listed on the London Stock Exchange, has been through numerous iterations. It was bought out of administration only last year by a group of businessmen led by Sandeep Vyas and Haseeb Aziz.Benjamin Wiles of Duff \u0026amp Phelps said: “Calvetron Brands has faced the perfect storm of extremely difficult trading conditions on the high street, rising costs and low customer confidence all of which hindered our ability to secure a buyer.“We have explored a number of potential options, however no viable offers for the business as a going concern have been received.

Over the last week sales of BBQ foods, salads, ice-cream, beer, and wine have been the most popular items bought at Tesco, which predicted a further sales uplift in the run-up to England’s quarter-final game with Sweden on Saturday afternoon.

It also reported the best summer barbecue meat sales for several years. By the end of this week Tesco expects to have sold more than 1m burgers and,1m hot dog rolls, 6m ice lollies, around 1m tubs of ice-cream, almost 50m bottles or cans of beer and close to 1m bottles of wine. “Fantastic weather and the world’s biggest sporting event are creating a real carnival atmosphere across Britain this week,” said Tesco barbecue meats buyer, Natalie Bastow. “The mere mention of a heatwave is enough to change shopping plans and judging by sales many people are enjoying al fresco dining right now.” The British Retail Consortium predicted consumers would embark on a £90bn spending spree over the summer – which includes TVs and barbecues – as a buoyant mood swept the UK.“The fantastic temperatures – and the World Cup – have meant that shoppers have been coming in their droves this week to buy frozen food and drink,” said Nigel Broadhurst, Iceland’s managing director."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7571f5e61f7f17381531ffb4a30d9491aadbcfcd/0_327_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dd0e4a25234cb637afebbd1abc21376","title":"from solar torches to bioloos five frugal innovations from around the world","story":"Not everyone wants to send rockets into space. For these innovators, a cheap, effective, no-frills product is the goalWhether it’s bringing quality healthcare closer to those residing in rural villages or providing people with facilities as basic and necessary as toilets, it’s sometimes wise not to overcomplicate things. Frugal innovation, based on the Indian concept of jugaad – innovating when there are limitations in resources – can provide an answer when capital is low, resources are scarce, or infrastructure is in need of upgrading.Here are five businesses putting frugality at the forefront of innovation.Peek Vision works with partners to improve access to high-quality eye care using the Peek Acuity and Peek Acuity Pro smartphone vision-test apps, and Peek Retina, a smartphone adapter for examining inside the eye. The apps, which are designed by eye care professionals, enable anyone to examine a patient’s eyes and assess the quality of their sight. The patient is shown a letter in the app and has to identify it as it increases and decreases in size and changes direction. The patient’s answers are graded by the app, which also determines their score at the end of the test.For people living in remote parts of the world, accessing healthcare can mean travelling a considerable distance – especially problematic when there are medical emergencies.With ClickMedix, an app that enables health workers to screen, diagnose and refer patients on for treatment, villagers can avoid the lengthy travel times – and the associated costs. The app works by taking local health professionals through a questionnaire, guiding them to ask patients appropriate questions and then directing them to the relevant treatment or referral options. The app can be used to screen patients for a number of conditions, including HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.Ting Shih, ClickMedix CEO and founder, says: “What’s important about frugal innovation is that you’re empowering the local people to see the power and to know that there are solutions and to help deliver the solutions, which then actually enables true adoption.”From shopping to streaming, the internet has changed the way many of us conduct our everyday lives - but the same isn’t true for rural areas with poor connectivity.Launching across the Ivory Coast this July, Dor2Dor – a delivery service powered by Be-Bound’s augmented connectivity technology – is set to transform the delivery landscape for people in remote areas. Parcels will be delivered within 48 hours, including to homes without conventional addresses. Deloitte estimates that over five years Dor2Dor will create 100,000 new jobs directly, and a further 500,000 indirectly.Mélanie Delaroche Curtil, communications assistant at Be-Bound, says: “The beauty of frugal innovation is that it is right in front of us. It is making something new with something old.” The award-winning Frontier Markets collaborates with consumers and local entrepreneurs on solutions that put the customer first. Its solar torch, designed by and for rural women, is one example. Women living in rural India are disproportionately affected by the negative effects of limited access to energy and have fewer income-generating opportunities. They can use the torches for personal use or be trained to sell them. The torch costs less than $20 and is more efficient than market alternatives that use lead-acid batteries. Currently, Frontier Markets works across 22 districts in Rajasthan with a network of 1,000 women entrepreneurs.In response to India’s often-limited sanitation facilities – with 626 million people practicing open defecation – Banka BioLoo was born. The brainchild of Namita Banka, the company’s chief executive and founder, bioloos tackle the lack of secure, dignified and eco-friendly places to go to the toilet in some areas of India.The bioloos treat human waste with bacterial cultures, meaning off-site disposal and treatment of excrement is not required. As a result, transport of human waste is eliminated, reducing pollution. And, because the bioloos are found in 20 states across India, in everything from trains and schools to communities and hospitals, more people can safely use the toilet, decreasing instances of open defecation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bd2829520384706c4a631eeaa8048b1874f91a6/21_0_4959_2976/master/4959.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e6f2c05ff8616ed406bcc2c5d8e9e4b","title":"in big tech v big retail the real losers are store workers sears amazon","story":"It’s becoming a common story across America: the opening of an Amazon ‘fulfilment center’ hastens the end of local department stores, like this Sears in Sacramento Photographs by Robert GumpertIn the Sacramento area of northern California, an Amazon fulfilment centre came online last year, striking, it would seem, another blow to the local outlets of Sears, one of America’s signature brick and mortar department stories. spoke to Sears workers at the Sunrise Mall in Citrus Heights who were told earlier this year the store would be closing down. That Sears store and another outlet nearby in Roseville are slated to close by 15 July, following announcements by the Sears Holding Company in March and April heralding the closure of more than 100 stores.“Since April, the inventory here is being handled by a liquidation company, so it doesn’t sync with Sears’ website. People might say ‘This cost $63 online’, but we might sell it to them for $53. Or $73.It’s sad. Customers are coming up to me and saying how they’ve been shopping here for 40 years. Our older employees who’ve been here a while all live nearby. So, yeah, it’s rough. What will I do when the store closes? I’ll go back to college. And apply to work at Costco.”“I got here four months ago and, my first day on the job, they announced the store is closing. I had hoped to make some money, to look after myself, to help my dad with the bills. But all of those hopes went down.Later this month there will be an expo for other stores to come and interview our employees and see if any of us are a good match for them. After the initial announcement, a couple of workers quit. One guy had been here 20 years, and they’d never raised his pay. He was earning $11 an hour, like me.Would I work at the nearby Amazon fulfilment center? I didn’t know there was one. Yeah, I’d be interested in that.”“I got here in 1998 – 20 years ago! But after 9-11 I was called up by the air force reserves and spent three years in Qatar. So I’ve been here parts of 17 years. I’ve been down here on the bottom floor long enough that I’ve pretty much mastered the art of selling. This was a day we all kind of saw coming. There was the recession, and we never really bounced back from the real-estate crisis, and Amazon took off in 2011 or so. So I predicted this, but I thought we’d have a little more time. As recently as three years ago, this store was still in tip-top shape. But then the losses to Amazon really began mounting up. These last three-to-five years is when it really began to show. How did I react when I got the news the store was closing? Well, it was my birthday. I got an email. Thankfully, we had already gone out to eat and I didn’t find out until the end of the night. And I was shocked … but not totally shocked. I am retired air force, but I’ll still need to work. I will press on, possibly with Sears. Post-9-11, I’ve been thinking of getting into healthcare, so I could help people out. And there are opportunities with Gulfstream (the aerospace company). And I may just take some time off. I live right here in Citrus Heights. I walk to work. I am going to miss that.”“The tragedy for the community is a demographic one. People are ageing out. I’ve lived here more than 20 years I’ve seen all this. People are going online or going to specialty stores. So Sears is experiencing what every traditional American business is: there’s pressure to either enhance the personal connection, or it’s super-duper price-driven. I understand this because I worked in supermarkets for years, and the trend is either toward Whole Foods or, on the other end of the spectrum, toward Walmart. It’s a real polarisation.Also, our being in the middle of suburbia is not ideal we’re 20 or 30 minutes from the freeway, depending on traffic. I recently completed my master’s in Asian and Pacific studies at the University of San Francisco. This store’s closure was both gradual and sudden – like the death of a loved one. And for me, as an aspiring academic, this is both a gentle push and an abrupt shove.”“Our parents shopped at Sears, as did our parents’ parents. So it’s real sad. This is an old store, and most Sears are old. I’ve been here, I don’t even know how many years. I’ve lost count. More than 20. It’s my home away from home. And it’s hard to find another home, especially when you get older. This store is closing because of – what do you call it? – Amazon. People shopping online. But this store was in the black! Our lease was not renewed Sears did not own this building, it sold it and was leasing it back. And now I bet they’re gonna tear it down.Our last day here is June 23 and our last selling day is the ninth. And, on top of that, we were ripped off the other night. Two guys got our Oakley and Ray-Ban frames, like, 76 of them. They’re worth like $170 to $200 a frame that’s about $14,000. It’s just the icing on the cake. What a punch in the gut. I use that clock for all my clients. After they put on their glasses, I ask them, ‘Can you see that clock? What time is it?’ It’s sad: the kids, they don’t know how to tell time on an analogue clock.”“I go around the store talking to people about improvements in their home – roofs, bathrooms, kitchens – and set up appointments. I am the only person in the store doing this. After this store closes, I am going to be reassigned to either the Arden Fair mall or our outlet at McClellan air force base. How do I feel about that? If they put me at McClellan, it’ll be more convenient for me than it is now.”After this? I got an offer. From Sam’s Jewelers, here in the mall. But I want a break. After 10 years I want a break. I volunteer at Casa Garden, which benefits the Sacramento Children’s Home. My husband is a master gardener at UC Davis. We are going to do some gardening. And I have two sons who are doctors – a surgeon in Texas and an ear-nose-throat specialist in West Virginia. I am going to do some travelling. Look, I don’t want to shop on the internet I want to put my hands on the materials. A lot of people are like that. Especially our older customers. They know us. They are our regulars. They don’t like change. They are not computer-literate. A lot of my colleagues are looking for full-time jobs. So it’s sad for the customers.

But in its current home, critics say rising house prices and growing inequality have damaged the cityImage shows Seattle from 2015 to 2017by  Chris McGreal in SeattleHowever they see Amazon, for good or ill, residents of the fastest-growing city in the US largely agree on the price Seattle has paid to be the home of the megacorporation: surging rents, homelessness, traffic-clogged streets, overburdened public transport, an influx of young men in polo shirts and a creeping uniformity rubbing against the city’s counterculture.But the issue of Jeff Bezos’s balls is far from settled. “Have you seen the Bezos balls?” asked Dave Christie, a jewellery maker at a waterfront market who makes no secret of his personal dislike for the man who founded and still runs Amazon. “No one wanted them. They’ve disfigured downtown. Giant balls say everything about the man. Bezos is holding Seattle hostage.”It’s not strictly true to say everyone is against the three huge plant-forested glass spheres at what Amazon calls its “campus” in the heart of the city. The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower. “They are absolutely gorgeous. There was nothing in that area 10 years ago,” said Jen Reed, selling jerky from another market stall. “I don’t hate Amazon the way that a lot of people hate them. Seattle has changed a lot. My rent’s gone from $500 to $1,000, but outside of that Amazon have been beneficial. It’s give and take, and anyway we invited them here.”But even those sympathetic to the biggest retailer in the US are questioning whether there has been more take than give. Amazon has long been accused of stretching the city’s transit and education systems, and its highly paid workers have driven up prices of goods and housing.The resentful murmur recently became a roar after Amazon reacted to the city’s latest tax proposal, which would have charged large businesses an annual $275 per employee, by resorting to what critics call blackmail. In mid-June, less than a month after unanimously passing the tax, Seattle’s council abandoned it in the face of threats from the corporation. The tension has sharpened the debate about whether the city can retain its identity as one of the most progressive in the country, or is destined to be just another tech hub.Ironically, given Amazon’s much-publicised “city sweepstakes”, in which municipalities in North America are competing to land the company’s second headquarters, Seattle did not reach a Faustian pact with Amazon to lure it in the first place. The city gave no tax breaks and passed no anti-union laws, although the fact that Washington state law bars income tax was certainly appealing. The council did encourage the firm’s massive growth, however, with accommodations on building regulations that helped drive $4bn in construction.John Burbank of the Economic Opportunity Institute said there is a a direct link between the surge in highly paid jobs and the numbers of people forced on to the street.Amazon has sought to improve its standing with financial support for organisations such as Mary’s Place to build a new shelter for 200 homeless women and families. It is a similar story as schools and public transportation grapple to keep up with the rapidly rising population and the demographic shift it is causing.  But still the flow of cars to the Amazon campus has led to long traffic jams to the interstate. The bus route to the same area, the No 8, is notorious as one of the most overcrowded and delayed in the city, prompting a derisory Twitter account with the slogan “You can’t say late without 8!”.In other cities, rising salaries would be a boon to public coffers, but Seattle is burdened with one of the most regressive tax systems in the country.“As a result we’re leaving millions of dollars on the table that should be going into public investments in our state and in our city. We’re increasing taxes on the people who can least afford to pay taxes and we’re letting the affluent off the hook.”This is not how large numbers of people in Seattle think things should work. They argue that Amazon should contribute to upgrading a transport system that’s struggling under the influx it created, and improving schools that provide the educated workforce the company benefits from. “It is sort of a bipolar relationship because we do have a progressive city in some respects, we have a progressive city council in some respects, and then we have an environment that embraces inidual wealth,” said Burbank.“So if it has to do with personal freedom, that’s OK. But if it has to do with actually trying to create a shared quality of life which entails taxation of the affluent or higher taxation, that’s not OK. And so this is a really good city for him because we have a lot of personal freedom and we have no taxation. Of course chickens are going to come home to roost at some point.” Bezos’s company has arguably done much to erode the liberal and progressive culture of the city that first attracted him. Unlike other locally based giant corporations such as Microsoft, Starbucks and Boeing, Amazon planted itself in the heart of the city, and the influx of well-paid tech workers has changed the feel of Seattle. Keenan-Lai sees it in the erosion of the identity of her old neighbourhood on the city’s Capitol Hill and the disappearance of older, quirky restaurants, driven out by newer, more polished places. “I can’t begrudge people moving to try to find opportunity,” she said. “But I do hear a lot of people say ‘I don’t want those programmers coming to Seattle’. It does create a lot of tension. Amazon represents both innovation and progress, and also dystopian fears for a lot of folks.” Reed, at the market stall, added: “It’s definitely weird when you go into a e bar that used to have bike gangs and now everyone’s in a polo shirt.”The city council has struggled to find a path that remains true to Seattle’s progressive values while keeping the source of much of its recent prosperity happy. In 2015 it became the first major US city to increase its minimum wage to $15 an hour. Keenan-Lai said 100,000 people – then quarter of the working population of the city – benefited from the measure, but that its impact was swiftly eroded. “The increase in the cost of housing has exceeded the increase in wages,” she said. “When we were advocating for $15 an hour the idea was that everyone who lived in Seattle could afford to live here. Our housing market just skyrocketed.”Seattle, forced by the lack of an income tax to hunt for innovative means of raising revenue, has run into resistance from Amazon at every turn. The friction peaked over the recent worker tax, which was expected to raise around $50m a year to help pay for affordable housing and services for people made homeless by escalating rents and property prices. Amazon, however, in actions critics called blackmail, characterised it as a “jobs tax”, threatened to freeze construction in the city and backed a petition drive to put the issue to a popular vote in November.The city’s chamber of commerce and other businesses threw their weight behind the ballot initiative. Popular support for the measure collapsed amid accusations that it would cost jobs and that the money would not be put to good use because the council lacks a coherent strategy to cope with the homeless crisis. Under pressure from Amazon, the council broke, and only two of the city’s nine councillors voted to keep the tax. One of them, Kshama Sawant, a member of Socialist Alternative, accused the council of a “cowardly betrayal” and called Bezos “our enemy”.Sawant, a driving force behind the $15 minimum wage, said it would be a mistake to expect Amazon to behave any differently. The company, she said, could easily afford the tax but opposed it for ideological reasons.“It’s not a tax on jobs,” she said. “It is not a tax on employees. It’s a tax on big business. For the people who would actually be paying this, it is pocket change, and yet they are fighting fiercely against it. ‘Good corporate citizen’ is an oxymoron, because Jeff Bezos and the billionaire class have no incentive to do the right thing.”Amazon has said that while it opposed the worker tax, it is “deeply committed to being part of the solution”, and points to its support of nonprofits in the city. The company declined to comment for this article.Critics are not persuaded. Some see the company as attempting to shape a future in which Seattle’s residents are dependent on Amazon’s largesse through the funding of NGOs to deal with social issues, giving the company undue power at the expense of democratic institutions. “Amazon is very much, ‘We want to save the world too, let’s do it together.’ And then as you get into the details, not so much,” said Keenan-Lai. “There is a lot of benefit we provide to Amazon but the city has had a really hard time extracting benefit from the company in return.” Still, Keenan-Lai said the city’s history of progressive struggle is deep-rooted. “There’s been a long understanding that corporations can’t continue doing what they’re doing,” she said. “In Seattle, we’ve been fighting back for a long time.”This week  Cities takes a deeper look at the relationship between tech and US cities, asking whether tax giveaways are worth the cost.

In part this was because I believed the gender stereotypes. Being a woman, I\u0026nbspthought, meant wearing makeup and high heels men expecting things from me that I in no way wanted to give them. Being a woman seemed limiting and terrifying, and definitely not me. So as soon as I started to go through puberty, I starved myself until I looked safely asexual and boyish again. That was my solution, in 1992, to avoiding being a woman.I thought about that period of my life this week when I read an interview in the Daily Mirror with a transgender teenager who was born female. At the age of six, he told his mother he wanted to climb trees with boys. “Don’t do that, it’s not what girls do,” his mother replied. According to the report, the six-year-old\u0026nbspreplied, “Well, I’ll have a sex-change then.”“I never fitted in with the girls at school. I didn’t like\u0026nbspmakeup, or dresses, and I never wanted to shave my\u0026nbsplegs or armpits, like everyone else. I really wanted to\u0026nbspdo all the things boys did, and wear masculine clothes. I think even that young, deep down, I knew I\u0026nbspwanted to be a man,” he told the Mirror.Whether somebody really decided to change sex because of climbing trees and makeup or, as is far more likely, this was oversimplified reporting on the Mirror’s part, nowhere in the article is there any suggestion that an aversion to feminine clothing doesn’t prove you’re a man. This interview was strikingly reminiscent of an interview on BBC Radio 4’s iPM programme, aired in 2016, in which a mother said she realised her three-year-old daughter wasn’t really a girl because she played with Wolverine toys instead of baby dolls. The interviewer did not challenge her. CBBC screened a documentary in the same year, I Am Leo, about a trans boy, in which transgenderism was explained with the help of pink brains for girls and blue brains for boys.What kind of message is this sending to girls: that if they don’t like dolls, or pink, they are literally in the wrong body? It’s hard to see how it helps anyone – least of all transgender people – for the media to reduce transgenderism to feelings about makeup, and the female experience to femininity.I once thought that definitions of gender would keep expanding until the idea of gender itself was rendered irrelevant but, to my astonishment, they have shrunk and hardened, and this has had an effect on how men and women see each other and themselves. In Nanette, her excellent new standup show on Netflix, the comedian Hannah Gadsby talks about her weariness with being told by members of the public that she must be a trans man in denial, because she is a lesbian who wears trousers. Because that’s where some of the current gender debates have led us: to women being told that they’re not really women if they don’t enjoy wearing pretty dresses.Far from gender being “on a spectrum”, as the current lingo has it, too many well-meaning articles about it are more binary than ever: girls are like this, boys are like that. This is what feminists like me object to because gender is restrictive and femininity in particular was conceived to be limiting. News that 40 British schools have banned skirts in favour of trousers, in a hamfisted attempt at gender neutrality, is merely a different side to the same coin, because the message being sent to children is, “Skirts are too dangerously feminine to be worn by boys.”For me, not eating was at least in part an expression of anxiety about femininity and sexuality, represented by my changing body. This is extremely common among teenage girls, who then find ways to punish the bodies that are taking them into womanhood, whether they like it or not, and it is getting even more so.There is no single cure for unhappy girls, but as adults it is up to us to teach our children that one does not need to change one’s body to reject socially imposed gender stereotypes. Girls can swing from the trees like monkeys and plait their own leg hair they can play with tea sets and measure their life in lipsticks or they can do all of the above simultaneously, if they so please, and none of this has anything to do with their bodies, biology or brain colour. Biological sex goes deeper than leg hair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c761d319dc5554a1562635db5de89ef1800c5873/0_45_3568_2141/master/3568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=337a0963d46ced3d41fac20322f06404","title":"esther mcvey lies work pensions universal credit","story":"In a world of fake news and downright mendacity, lying to parliament may seem like just another day in politics. But the work and pensions secretary Esther McVey’s non-apology in the Commons on Wednesday, deliberately repeating fabrications about the universal credit (UC) disaster, takes indifference to facts to a new level of insolence.The comptroller and auditor general, Sir Amyas Morse, who is in charge of the rigorously independent National Audit Office, has a reputation for strict propriety and extreme circumspection in his public comments. It takes unprecedented misrepresentation of an NAO report to force him to take the extraordinary step of publishing his letter of reprimand to the minister in charge of the Department for Work and Pensions. What else can he do when this minister has the effrontery to refuse to meet him? She plainly takes a Trumpist approach to inconvenient realities, so why bother meeting this annoying nitpicker?Even more impudent was her claim that his report was based on outdated statistics: he spells out how carefully figures were squared with DWP officials right up to publication. All this matters critically to millions of low-paid families on the brutal sharp end of UC.Cavalier trashing of the NAO, our sacred keeper of the flame of facts, evidence and honest auditing, is profoundly alarming. This government, engaged in monumentally perilous Brexit negotiations, needs now more than ever to engage with difficult truths without flinching from inconvenient realities.But instead McVeyism is everywhere. Duncan Smith, the architect of UC and many other calamities in one of the most disaster-causing political careers of our time, had the gall to tell parliament that Morse’s report is “a shoddy piece of work”. As he appears on our screens day after day propounding preposterous Brexit unrealities, broadcasters should ask if there comes a point when a politician found responsible for an act of such monumental failure is stripped of all public credibility?

Don’t get me wrong. Can-kicking has a necessary place in politics. Theresa\u0026nbspMay has often had little choice but to resort to it. But the road and the can-kicking must end at Chequers on Friday. That’s when the prime minister and her ided cabinet must finally decide what kind of relationship they seek with the EU after Brexit.In the end, May’s government faces the same two choices at Chequers that it has faced throughout all the twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations. Either the government must embrace a form of soft Brexit that it can then persuade the rest of Europe to accept as a proper basis for good future relations – the option that May herself and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, both prefer and will put forward – or it must reject that option and prepare for a no-deal Brexit, in which all of Britain’s economic and political relations with Europe and the rest of the world become matters of pure conjecture. There are no other choices on the table. If Brexit is to go ahead, it is simply\u0026nbspone or the other.This means, therefore, that only the first of the two choices is in fact a serious option. If the cabinet rejects May’s and Hammond’s approach and adopts a no-deal option as government policy, there would be both a parliamentary and an extra-parliamentary revolt against it. Large businesses such as British Airways might relocate to Europe. Labour might even find an explicit anti-Brexit voice. One way or another, the no-deal approach would therefore explode on the launch pad. And Brexit might even not take place.A soft Brexit, while not officially defined, would keep Britain in either the single market or the customs union or both. It could be achieved along the lines of the Norway model (see EEAEFTA) or via an FTA, but would require concessions on free movement, ECJ jurisdiction and budget payments. Brexiters do not consider a soft Brexit as really leaving the EU.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.Most ministers are neither idiots nor wreckers, so the no-deal option is not going to happen. It is even questionable as to whether any of the no-dealers will\u0026nbspresign. The much more serious question, though, is whether the soft Brexit package that May wants to\u0026nbspsell to the cabinet is much of a runner either. This question has not been asked often enough in debates around Brexit because so much attention is focused on the splits and personalities in the Conservative party. Even\u0026nbspif\u0026nbspMay\u0026nbspsucceeds – as she probably will – in getting\u0026nbspthe government to agree a form of customs arrangement, aspects of single market access and a soft\u0026nbspborder in Ireland, that is not the end of the matter but the beginning of it.Partly that is because the terms of the soft Brexit option can’t be known until after Chequers. May’s case to the cabinet is still a work in progress, with rebel ministers and Number 10 still negotiating about some of the details, before the publication of a government white paper on Brexit policy next week. The usual cabinet suspects may still be briefing the usual rightwing papers about the likelihood of “almighty rows” and the unacceptability of May’s “softest Brexit” approach. But a consensus looks more likely at this stage than an explosion. The larger uncertainty, though, is whether the EU will give May’s supposed compromise the time of day. On the face of it, the chances look slim to vanishing, except at a very high price to the UK.The European commission negotiator Michel Barnier has consistently – and accurately – argued the EU’s rules-and-law-based approach: that the institutions are inisible and that bespoke deals of the sort that Britain talks about would infringe them. There is not much reason to suppose that this is going to change radically in the time available to meet the article 50 deadline next\u0026nbspMarch.Many ministers and civil servants dismiss this view. They have persuaded themselves that the EU is essentially pragmatic. They think Brussels lives by political fixes – as the council did last week on migration or as the German coalition did on the same issue this week. They believe that at the 11th hour of the Brexit process, the clock will be stopped and the wheeling and dealing will kick in. This expectation underlies May’s entire approach at Chequers on Friday. It’s why on Thursday May is meeting Angela Merkel, who is still seen as possessing the power to knock heads together and make deals.Although May is often dismissed as a weak leader, she nevertheless has cards in her hand. Most of her MPs and activists still back her. She would win a confidence vote, if one was called. There is no self-evidently better Tory leader – and several worse ones. She remains focused on delivering what for leavers is still the pre-eminent prize: Brexit itself, in which the UK would be “an independent political state”, as Michael Gove put it on the radio on Wednesday. But she is attempting to do it on terms that would help to appease Tory remainers and keep the party together. These are not negligible assets.This week – in an art gallery in Munich, of all places – I\u0026nbspfound myself in front of a painting by the 18th-century Leeds artist Julius Caesar Ibbetson that looked like a metaphor for the Chequers Brexit decision. The 1785 painting shows an early hot-air balloon, painted in union jack colours, rising into the sky above south London, carrying two passengers. There has been speculation that the two, a Mr Biggin and a Mrs\u0026nbspSage, may have become the first members of the mile-high club while they drifted towards their eventual descent near Harrow, but that’s another story.The point, though, is that Mr Biggin and Mrs Sage in their union jack balloon only got into the sky because a lot of ballast was thrown overboard and because two other intended passengers remained on the ground because they were too heavy. So it is with Theresa May and her Brexit hot-air balloon. It will fly only if it is not weighed down by needless weight and unrealistic expectations. It may not get very far before it comes down to Earth. And in the long run, balloons were not the answer anyway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f20c37b21a311b9636adf5dd901c5602919cad0c/0_0_620_224/master/620.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83b43153b9874637fc32d714ba8aedfe 700w","title":"hottest heatwaves books film music","story":"Tension simmers, passions rage and things are never the same again. We pick the books, film and music in which heatwaves inspire race riots, sexual abandon – and even a chainsaw massacre ‘I love England in a heatwave,” says a character in Ian McEwan’s novel Atonement. “It’s a different country. All the rules change.” And he’s not just referring to the sudden hike in the price of a 99 Flake. In works of art, the weather is a reliable indicator for internal turbulence, with the heatwave an especially pliable metaphor. It is called into service to signify everything from overwhelming passions to oppressive tensions, a ripening or a boiling-over. Not for nothing is an entire genre, the coming-of-age story, predicated on the idea that things were never the same again after that summer.The pinnacle is LP Hartley’s The Go-Between, the overarching influence on Atonement, in which the relentlessly beating sun is a transformative force: “In the heat, the commonest objects changed their nature. Walls, trees, the very ground one trod on, instead of being cool were warm to the touch: and the sense of touch is the most transfiguring of all the senses … In the heat the senses, the mind, the heart, the body, all told a different tale. One felt another person, one was another person.” It’s hard to stay cool in a heatwave, especially if you’re British and unaccustomed to its severity. Just ask Alice, whose adventures in Wonderland are precipitated by weather which makes her feel “very sleepy and stupid” and causes her to wonder “whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies.” Jean Rhys in her Jane Eyre prequel Wide Sargasso Sea describes “the time of day when though it is hot and blue and there are no clouds, the sky can have a very black look,” while McEwan has used heat to apply additional pressure to his characters, much as a sadistic schoolboy might pursue ants with a magnifying glass. The orphaned brood of The Cement Garden lose their innocence as the world rots in the sunshine (“Outside there was a cloud of flies round the overflowing dustbins … A packet of butter had melted into a pool … it was the hottest day since 1900”) while the doomed romance of Atonement unravels against a savage summer of “vast heat that rose above the house and park, and lay across the Home Counties like smoke, suffocating the farms and towns”. It encourages — or so the parents are inclined to believe — “loose morals amongst young people”. Wherever sunshine and British people mix, the result is likely to be fraught think of EM Forster dispatching his creations to Italy and to India, or of the film-maker Joanna Hogg sending the upper-class holidaymakers of her 2006 debut, Unrelated, off to Tuscany to be perfectly miserable. Here the heat and beauty serve as an effective counterpoint to whatever woes the characters are experiencing. Anna (Kathryn Worth) is tormented by a failing relationship, her yearning for a child and the callous flirtations of a man two decades her junior (played by a young, icicle-eyed Tom Hiddleston). The delicious scenery seems only to exacerbate her problems. There’s a similar dynamic at play in Chris Power’s recent short-story collection Mothers, where a series of far-flung idylls only point up the characters’ inner discomfort: Cadaqués becomes the backdrop for a cataclysmic decision, Rhodes the site of childhood trauma, Mexico City the burial ground for an irresolvable desire. Whatever the problem, the heat seems to both reflect and inflame it. Nowhere is this truer than in some of America’s sweatiest cinema. Would The Texas Chainsaw Massacre have been less scary or oppressive if it had been relocated, say, to Anchorage? The director Tobe Hooper littered the set with animal bones and carcasses, and somehow the stench that caused cast and crew members to throw up in the stifling heat seems to waft off the screen toward our nostrils. Perspiration drips off every face in Sidney Lumet’s scorching Dog Day Afternoon, with Al Pacino and John Cazale as touchingly ill-prepared criminals who choose the hottest day of the year to hold up a New York City bank. Lumet knew what he was doing putting the screws on by turning up the heat — he’d done the same thing in Twelve Angry Men, where it was only the suits and ties that distinguished the jury room from a sauna.Michael Douglas is just one angry man stalking Los Angeles in Falling Down, where it’s hard not to feel that a light shower might cure at least some of his ills then again, it never rains in southern California. Even if it did, would it help? “You’d think the rain would’ve cooled things down,” says Thelma Ritter in Hitchcock’s Rear Window, another thriller set in a heatwave. “All it did was make the heat wet.” In Do the Right Thing, as with In the Heat of the Night before it, the heatwave becomes a manifestation of the racial tensions at the heart of America. Brooklyn’s fire hydrants are up for grabs, while DJ Mr Señor Love Daddy (Samuel L Jackson) gives a comical running commentary on the escalating temperatures: “If you have a Jheri curl, stay in the house or you’ll end up with a permanent plastic helmet on your head forevah!” But the heat is no easier to quell than the conflicts stoked by a racist police force and a pigheaded Italian-American restaurateur. The only balm is experienced by the viewer, grateful to be watching from the cold comfort of an air-conditioned cinema. Spike Lee, the director of Do the Right Thing, returned to New York and heatwaves in Summer of Sam, which mingled the real-life hunt in 1977 for the serial killer known as Son of Sam, with the emergence of punk in America. The real summer of punk had taken place a year earlier in Britain, during the country’s own record-breaking heatwave (highs of more than 28C for 22 days, making it the hottest summer for three centuries), with Denis Howell, given ministerial responsibility for coping with drought, advising people to “take a bath with a friend” to conserve water. That same 1976 summer permeates Maggie O’Farrell’s novel Instructions for a Heatwave. Simmering family problems are manifested in the heat that “inhabits the house like a guest who has outstayed his welcome: it lies along corridors, it circles around curtains, it lolls heavily on sofas and chairs.” One thing the hot weather can do in art is to eliminate social isions. It’s an equaliser: if everyone’s in their bathing suits, as they are in Eric Rohmer’s Pauline at the Beach, then the normal social hierarchies dissolve. In François Ozon’s Swimming Pool, there can even be a kind of equality between a prissy British writer (Charlotte Rampling) and a promiscuous gadabout (Luine Sagnier). Though stripping off isn’t much help to Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) in The Talented Mr Ripley. “You’re so white,” says Dickie (Jude Law), Tom’s coveted social superior. “Grey, actually.” Summer heat can plunge the reader or viewer in an instant into an airless fug. Take the opening line of Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar: “It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn’t know what I was doing in New York.” But the air of melancholy hanging over the season is impossible to dispel because we know what lies around the corner. In two novels by Alan Hollinghurst, summer represents the last gasp of gay abandon before the decimating sweep of Aids: first in his 1988 debut The Swimming Pool Library, which takes place in “the last summer of its kind there was ever to be” and then in The Line of Beauty, the 2004 Booker prize winner, which picks up the thread in that same summer, 1983, and follows it into a more darkly troubled era. Even without the spectre of mortality, summer in art embodies a fleeting wistfulness, a carefree and uncontainable bliss. The Myth of the American Sleepover, the gorgeous 2012 debut film from David Robert Mitchell (who later made the chilling It Follows) is especially good on those seemingly endless juvenile summers when we clumsily forge our future selves like fumbling amateur blacksmiths. But if you want the mood of that movie distilled into seven minutes, it’s right there in David’s Last Summer, the final track (fittingly) from Pulp’s 1994 album His ’N’ Hers. Ash may have devoted a chunk of their career to turning lost summers into frenzied, bittersweet indie-pop (Bring Back the Summer, Buzzkill, Orpheus, Oh Yeah) while the Fall offered a pungent reality check on British People in Hot Weather (“Beached whale in Wapping  His armpit hairs are sprouting”). But it is Jarvis Cocker, picking his way through a daisy-chain of summery vignettes (“When we reached the stream I put a bottle of cider into the water to chill  Both of us knowing that we’d drink it long before it had the chance”), who captures most vividly the pull and the pain of summer, wending his way toward the lengthening shadows that signal autumn’s approach:And as we walked home we could hear the leaves curling and turningBrown on the trees,And the birds deciding where to go for winter.And the whole sound,The whole sound of summer packing its bags and preparing to leave town."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f10f48ef8380e2b5371adcbf9956c3a2a98d193/49_0_1475_885/master/1475.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eb00e654a54923786b1bcdb9c79e13d","title":"does the moon hold the key to the earths energy needs","story":"Tidal power is the only renewable source derived from the moon. Now an extraordinary array of devices promise to unlock this vital energy potentialUsing giant kites, blades and paddles, and mimicking pogo sticks, blowholes and even the human heart, groups around the world are on the cusp of harnessing the colossal power of the oceans.The challenge is huge - seas have been battering coasts and sweeping sailors to their doom for millennia - but so is the prize: huge amounts of clean, reliable and renewable electricity for an energy-hungry world. Taking on the challenge of operating in this savage, corrosive environment is not for the faint-hearted, and the costs remain worryingly high, as demonstrated by the government’s rejection on Monday of a £1.3bn tidal project at Swansea. “There is no doubt – shit happens during marine renewable energy projects,” says François Renelier at Bessé, a French insurance broker.But the ocean energy sector is frothing with ideas, with hundreds of companies developing an extraordinary array of devices and backed by billions of dollars of investment. Among the serious contenders tapping rapid tidal flows are 12 metre-wide underwater kites that soar and swoop.“We fly with the tides,” says Martin Eklund, at Minesto, which is installing a £25m array off Anglesey, north Wales. “The main advantage is we can harvest energy from very low currents. This resource is abundant – it is everywhere.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“We will need every kind of renewables we can get out hands on, including marine, to move us around, heat our homes and so on,” says Declan Meally, at the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.Many nations, from Ireland to India to Korea, are now making moves and tidal and wave energy capacity doubled in 2017, albeit from a very small base. China has invested $200m since 2010 in ocean energy, and the EU €3bn in combined public and private money in the last decade.Tidal energy is most advanced. Bladed turbines are being deployed, which harness fast tidal flows in the same way wind turbines catch the wind. The world’s first large-scale tidal array, the Meygen project built by Atlantis Resources in Orkney, is now sending power to the grid. But, unlike the wind industry which has settled on a three-blade design, underwater designers are also testing four and six-bladed versions too.OpenHydro, already deployed in Canada’s Bay of Fundy, use giant 16m hoops with inward-pointing blades that resemble the mouth of a giant lamprey fish. Its makers opened the world’s first tidal turbine manufacturing plant in Cherbourg last week. There are also vertical turbines that spin like a fairground carousel, such as Hydroquest in France and LHD in China, and one company is even making an undulating membrane inspired by swimming fish.Capturing wave power is even more challenging than tapping the tides – “survivability” is the key term in this sector. “The cost of building something to withstand these extremes is the only thing that has held it back so far,” says Tom Denniss of Wave Swell in Australia. His company’s device works like a blowhole, with waves blasting air up a tube and out through a turbine.He compares developing wave technology to his own record-breaking feat of endurance running: “I ran 622 marathons in 622 days and it was a lot easier than developing marine energy technology - at least it took less time.” Other wave devices, such as Wedge Global, use buoys that bounce up and down on a pole, like a pogo stick, then duck underwater when storms rolls in. Another, Corpower, uses a hydraulic system inspired by the human heart to dampen the impact of the worst weather. “That has been the big challenge for wave energy – how to turn it on and off in big storms,” says chief executive, Patrik Möller.Paddles are being deployed too, such as WaveRoller, which uses long seafloor flaps that are washed back and forth by swells. Another, Wave Piston, uses paddles strung along a 185m pipe to push pressurised water through a generator.The Wave Piston’s biggest challenge to date was a big industrial trawler ramming into the system, despite the deployment having been cleared with the marine authorities. “We have had a lot of adventures, some good, some bad,” says Martin von Bülow, at the company.One technology that is not being widely pursued is tidal lagoon power. Here, large, expensive walls are constructed to trap seawater at high tide, which is released through turbines at low tide. But those constructed so far, such as in France and Korea, took advantage of sea walls being built for other purposes such providing a transport link.Which technologies make it into mass production remains to be seen, but the sector is backed at the highest levels, from Europe to China to Canada. “Clean renewable energy from the sea ticks all the right boxes,” says Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. “It is a groundbreaking industry with plenty of potential for new jobs and economic value, and in a world facing the devastating spectre of climate change, it also helps us supply homegrown energy while drastically cutting our greenhouse gas emissions,” he said at the International Conference on Ocean Energy in Cherbourg, France, last week.The way Denmark captured the wind turbine manufacturing market by moving early is inspiring many of the leading nations. “Everyone is trying to be the next Denmark, but for another technology,” says Bruce Cameron, the former director of renewable energy in Nova Scotia, which hosts the bay with the biggest tidal range in the world.However a major obstacle to ocean energy commercialisation has loomed into view: the stunning drop in cost of offshore wind power in the last year, as huge farms are rolled out. “While offshore wind in Europe has clearly come of age, ocean energy is still learning how to take the first steps,” says EU environment commissioner, Karmenu Vella.This has led some governments, such as the UK, directing their subsidy support to marine windfarms. This has left wave and tidal energy developers stranded between successful testing and the full-scale production that would then start driving costs down. “They call it the valley of death - we’re there,” says Marcelle Askew, at Swedish wave energy firm Seabased.However, some nations are still offering support: Canada has a feed-in-tariff and France, despite concerns at the finance ministry over costs, is expected to offer a major tender within months.Ocean energy supporters say it is essential in addition to offshore wind to drive progress towards a zero-carbon world. Tidal energy in particular has the advantage of being precisely predictable, years ahead. “As long as the moon circles around the Earth, you will always have tidal energy. But you can have no wind for days and days,” says Laurent Schneider-Maunoury, CEO of Naval Energies, the makers of OpenHydro.His company is also exploring another ocean energy technology which provides power 247, by exploiting the temperature difference between surface and deep waters to generate electricity. Like other ocean energy technologies, this may well already be competitive with the expensive diesel generators used in many small or isolated communities. Cost is not the only challenge to be overcome, such as ensuring coastal communities themselves benefit from projects and ensuring marine life is not endangered, though dolphins, seals and fish all appear to avoid the devices deployed so far.The big question remains undecided: will ocean energy will provide a major new wave of renewables in the years to come? Some have doubts, like Prof AbuBakr Bahaj, at Southampton University in the UK, and who has analysed the sector for 25 years. “I’m not really sure,” he says.Others, like Drew Blaxland, from developers Atlantis, says with many technologies now proven to work, it is simply time to scale up production and drive down the costs. His message is blunt: “Wake the hell up, grab it by the nuts and get on with it.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

He is a good player, very fast, who likes to cut inside. We must do not do anything stupid with him inside the box.”Sweden are the underdogs for the game in Samara but there is the feeling within the squad that the tag will suit them. The winger Viktor Claesson believes that the pressure will be on England. “They will expect to beat us and be expected to beat us,” Claesson said. “But we are going to make it difficult for them.”The captain, Andreas Granqvist, had a warning for England’s fans. “I read something about people in England suggesting that Sweden were a dream opponent,” he said. “Someone said something about 99 times out of 100 they would beat us? Well, it’s fun for England to have that sort of confidence. Let’s play the game and see how things go. Sweden usually play well against England. We’ve had good results against them.”The last time that the nations met was in a friendly in 2012 when Sweden won 4-2, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring all four goals, including an outrageous kung-fu-style kick from long range. Ibrahimovic retired from international football after Euro 2016 and he is not at the World Cup but, at times, it can feel as though he is.Ibrahimovic’s status is so heavyweight that he remains a talking point and he made headline-grabbing comments about the Sweden team after the second round of group stage ties. “I felt I can do it much better than them, obviously – and I still feel that,” Ibrahimovic said.Victor Lindelof says that he will be “about 95” by the time people stop asking him about Ibrahimovic and none of the players have been able to dodge questions on him.But Andersson’s squad have moved on from their long-time talisman and, in the absence of him and other any glamour name, the manager has placed the emphasis on the collective. The results have followed. Sweden finished on top of Group F, ahead of Mexico and Germany, before beating Switzerland in the last 16. Their compact style and unquenchable spirit have made them tough opponents.“We are a nation to be taken seriously,” Lindelof said. “It’s difficult to play against us because we defend very well and it’s hard to find spaces between the lines. We defend very well – with all 11 players on the pitch.”There has been a clamour in some quarters to anoint the attacking midfielder Emil Forsberg as the creative heir to Ibrahimovic but nobody inside the camp seems to like the comparison.“Ibrahimovic is the best player we had in Sweden and it’s difficult to compare players with him,” Lindelof said. “But Emil is a fantastic player and he deserves all the good things in life. I haven’t spoken to Ibrahimovic about what he has said about the team. How old will I be when people stop asking me about him? About 95.”Claesson added: “It was a long time ago that Ibrahimovic retired. We don’t pay attention to that talk. I didn’t even play in that team so for me it doesn’t matter. He can just keep on talking but I think he will be happy for us now. Am I frustrated to keep being asked about him? Yes! It’s better to focus on the players who did a great job here.”It was put to Claesson that, whereas the Sweden set-up used to revolve around one man, it was now about the team, “Yes,” he replied. “It’s perfect for us and for Sweden, the country. I think we like this. We are underdogs and a team together. It’s perfect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/237ad4f62c00aab0641f9881f756d4d97351008d/81_377_7104_4262/master/7104.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c61dec7b51a44358b59e5ce6fe680150","title":"england fans look to enjoy world cup good times while they last","story":"Anticipation before Saturday’s game against Sweden has begun to tip into deliriumSince England dramatically beat Colombia on penalties in the Spartak stadium, Carl Gould’s phone has not stopped buzzing: his wedding reception is due to begin at exactly the same moment England kick off against Sweden for their crunch World Cup quarter final and guests are understandably worried.“I have received a lot of texts asking if there’s going to be a television at the reception,” he says, “The answer is, no, there isn’t. We’re not getting married in a Wetherspoons.”Gould convincingly insists that his mind will be completely focused on his bride, Katie, but as someone who remembers the agonies of Euro 96 he is hoping the pair’s nuptials may bring the team luck. “I’ve lived through the England experience,” he says. “So I’m just hoping for the best.

Less than 24 hours after Gareth Southgate’s young team became the first England side to ever win a World Cup penalty shootout, anticipation ahead of the game against Sweden has already begun to tip into delirium.From suggestions that the new Heathrow terminal should be named after the England manager, to early hoarding of barbecue supplies, a nation that has known significantly more than 30 years of hurt is determined to enjoy this moment in the unexpected sunshine.“If the last eight years have taught us anything it is to enjoy the good times while they last,” says Mark Perryman, author of 1966 and Not All That. “There is that sense that people are going overboard – we beat Colombia on penalties, we’ve lost to Belgium. But with everything else that is going in the world, you have to enjoy it. We all just want it so much, don’t we.”But within seconds of Jordan Pickford’s save and Eric Dier’s winning penalty, scenes of mass jubilation and relief exploded in bars and clubs, living rooms and town squares. Chants of “It’s coming home” – a song with more resilience than a particularly hardy cockroach – echoed through the land and repeated, like ticker tape for several hours on thousands of different Twitter feeds.It would only be slightly overblown to describe it as a powerfully shared public experience of redemption, says John Williams, associate professor in sociology at Leicester university. “We witnessed manifestation of the national anxiety about who we are and what we can do,” he says. “This was a young team – and they came through. It’s a great kind of assertion of our national capabilities through sport.”For a country torn apart by a isive EU referendum vote, the collective release brought by a decent run at the World Cup has been heightened, he adds.“We are at a moment in our country’s history where we are uncertain about who we are, how we fit in to the rest of the world,” he says. “I think we’d like to say that the victory over Colombia says something about who we are as a people – we are facing an uncertain future and perhaps we hope we can deal with it in the same way that those young men did in Moscow.”The redemption of one man in particular has captured the nation’s imagination. The narrative arc that saw the agony of Southgate’s penalty miss in Euro 96 erased by England’s first ever World Cup victory on penalties in Moscow has created an unprecedented outpouring among already emotional fragile fans. “Southgate has just proved what it is to understand past mistakes so well you turn them into future victory. It’s the stuff of proper mythology,” declared broadcaster Emily Maitlis.Tweeting a picture of Southgate embrace of Colombia’s Mateus Uribe in the wake of his crucial penalty miss against England, singer and England fan Alistair Griffin quoted If, by Rudyard Kipling:But while long-suffering England fans can be forgiven for allowing themselves to enjoy the positivity sweeping the country, it is tinged with an anxiety of what is still to come, says Felicia Pennant, editor-in-chief of fashion and football zine Season. “It was an amazing achievement, but it wasn’t a perfect performance – and we are going to have to play better if we are really going to progress,” she says.And yet, with the delusion of a true England fan, she has faith that Southgate’s team can shake of the baggage of past tournaments and go all the way to the final. “We are chasing history,” she says. “I’m hoping for a new English standard – one were we play well, and just win in normal time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b0a33befe6df1657f570cac14a98c627639cf32/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=825a2df203e4908e65fee5401deb1d34","title":"world cup quarter finals fans belgium brazil croatia england france russia sweden uruguay","story":"Supporters from Belgium, Brazil, Croatia, England, France, Russia, Sweden and Uruguay preview the quarter-finalsIt’s been a rollercoaster. Roberto Martínez is delivering exactly what he promised: exciting but sometimes gung-ho football. It’s the total opposite of the rather dull and cautious football served by his predecessor, Marc Wilmots. The group stage was not the best of tests, but the first knockout game against Japan showed exactly what this team is about. They can be error-prone, but they showed great character and maturity to recover and win it with the last kick of the game.Eden Hazard has been scintillating, but Romelu Lukaku has been even more impressive. It took exceptional confidence and unselfishness to dummy the last pass in the build-up to Belgium’s winning goal against Japan and not take a shot himself.But I’m afraid the quarter-finals will be it for us. Brazil seem ruthless and flawless. We still have one too many errors in our team but perhaps Martínez will have a trick up his sleeve for the Brazil game. We’ll never stop believing, that’s for sure. Louis de ClippeleBrazil have not done anything that was not expected of them yet. Neymar’s antics attract all the attention but the defining statistic is that Brazil have only conceded six goals in 25 matches under Tite. I’ve been pleased with the way Brazil have restricted opponents to very few chances. Captain Thiago Silva has banished the ghosts of 2014, which cast doubts on his leadership. He has been rock solid. We boast versatile, intelligent players such as Philippe Coutinho, Gabriel Jesus, Paulinho and Casemiro. Roberto Firmino has also had a glorious impact when he has come on. Brazil have what it takes to win the World Cup. Belgium are the team that can hurt us the most, with Eden Hazard and Dries Mertens running at our full-backs. France have a dominant midfield but are more predictable in attack. If we survive the Belgium test on Friday, the trophy is within reach. Pedro FernandesI was impressed by how well we played in the group stage. The win against Nigeria was pretty straightforward, but demolishing Argentina in the second game was amazing. And we showed how deep the squad is when by beating Iceland in the final game. But we froze badly against Denmark. We lost focus and are probably lucky to have gone through on penalties. Dejan Lovren and Ante Rebić have played superbly so far. Luka Modric has been great too and I was so happy he held his nerve in the shootout against Denmark after he had already missed a penalty in the game. That showed guts. If we play like we did against Denmark, then Russia could beat us. But if we show the group stage form, we can reach the final – where France will probably beat us. Luka IvezićWe have performed well above my expectations. The players have been made to believe that they are good enough if they stick to the game plan and full credit must go to Gareth Southgate and the coaching staff for that. There seems to be a resilience in the team, a way of recovering from setbacks and finding a result, from the late winner against Tunisia to the penalty shootout success against Colombia. That feels very odd to type.I’ve been impressed with the way Raheem Stirling and Jesse Lingard have been buzzing around, causing trouble and always looking to make things happen. John Stones has been an asset in both boxes and is in real danger of fulfilling his potential. Jordan Pickford deserves great credit for two stunning, match-winning saves against Colombia he has banished any doubts about his suitability to be England’s new No 1. The star turn though has to be Harry Kane, a man whose self-confidence and ambition seem to have unlocked something for this team. Knowing there is someone on the pitch who will get the job done must be such a relief for these players. I don’t know anyone who thought he would be leading the scoring charts at this stage.Whatever happens from here on in should be taken at face value and celebrated accordingly. That’s what my head tells me, but this hasn’t really been a head tournament so far. My heart tells me that ties against Sweden and Croatia or Russia are negotiable – although Argentina and Spain probably thought the same thing about their chances. I think Brazil will win it. Neymar has the talent and support to have a decisive say – if he stands up for long enough. Jack RoeWe look like a really strong counter-attacking team. We have quality players and a welcome sense of solidarity, so will be hard to handle. France are playing like a team and that was the big question mark before the beginning of the World Cup. Full-backs Lucas Hernández and Benjamin Pavard have been great discoveries, Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kanté are complementing each other very well in the middle, and up front young Kylian Mbappé has confirmed that he is world class.I’m pretty sure we can win this tournament. The toughest challenge will be the quarter-final against Uruguay. We have nothing to fear from the other teams. Maxime LesaunierI thought we would qualify from the group, but I did not expect us to do it so confidently. Russia’s domination against Saudi Arabia and Egypt was impressive, thanks to Stanislav Cherchesov’s wise decisions. Our win against Spain in the last 16 was due to a mix of luck, dedication, physical readiness and the Spaniards’ inexplicable refusal to take risks.Mário Fernandes could easily be in a Brazil team he has been that good. We are lucky to have him in the Russia squad. He had a brilliant game against Spain and kept Isco and Jordi Alba very quiet. It was telling that we lost 3-0 to Uruguay in the only game he didn’t play so far. I have tickets for the final, so hopefully Russia will be there. But it’s hard to look past Tite’s Brazil side. Ilya SokolovI’m very impressed with our team’s performances so far. They don’t play the most attractive football but the team is exceeding expectations. Sweden have managed to build a solid team, especially in defence, and they’ve shown that fighting spirit and working hard can take you far. We may not have world class players in each position like many other teams in this tournament, but we have come this far by playing as a team and showing great character in every game. It has been a team effort.Our captain Andreas Granqvist has been incredible. He has been a true leader at the back – as he was in the qualifiers against Italy. As well as scoring decisive penalties against South Korea and Mexico, he has also shown the will to go forward and an ability to bring the ball up the field and create chances. Without him, we wouldn’t be where we are. This was his last chance to play in a World Cup and he is giving it everything.The only thing that concerns me is our attacking play. We haven’t managed to score enough goals from open play and we lack the kind of player who can decide games. Marcus Berg has missed some good chances in pretty much every game. That is a bit of a worry. But we definitely have a good chance against England. They will be the favourites but Sweden are not to be underestimated. We are a hard team to beat or even score against. We have been underdogs in most games so far but we’ve won them when we needed to. Everything is possible and I’m confident, but we are one or two offensive players away from reaching the final. Morris AnderssonWe’ve look well prepared for this tournament. A lot of thought has been put into teamwork and understanding among the players. They have left everything on the pitch and played with a lot of “garra charrua,” a term used in Uruguay to describe effort. The partnership between Edinson Cavani and Luis Suárez partnership up front has not disappointed. Not even Cristiano Ronaldo was able to stop those amazing goals against Portugal. I’m very optimistic and hope Uruguay will be lifting the World Cup trophy next Sunday.

And not a pun, but one for the Australians:I hope someone takes Neymar aside and tell him he’s missed this years Logies.Thanks kejovi. Eases the pain. Sorry to burst everyone’s bubble but ... that photo doing the rounds of Japan’s spotless dressing room after the Belgium game?So it’s cheers to the cleaners, rather than the memers.Imagine, in the following video, that there’s a big label above Alisson that says “ME” and a label over the ball that says “THIS STORY”.Jorge Valdano writing on Kylian Mbappé? Bloody hell, you better read it. Football is a very serious game but it is full of people doing all they can to make idiots of footballers.Mbappé, in this year of adaptation to his price and the expectations placed upon him, played well and played OK (he doesn’t know how to play badly). He also saw team-mates of the level of Edinson Cavani and Neymar from up close. A fine education, if you know how to see it, how to look for the right lessons.If a player so young can come out of that cocktail of experiences alive, he is a phenomenon, not just once but twice: for his talent and for his maturity. Jan Müller has emailed in with this fascinating tidbit: “As we get to read a lot about World Cup statistics lately, I wondered which nations are the most successful in World Cup history in relation to the size of their population.“I did some basic math and the results are quite astonishing: Uruguay is leading the pack by a large margin in all 3 categories of World Cups won, total games played and games won. Sweden, Croatia and Belgium are in the top 5 of games won and Sweden and Croatia also are in the top 4 of games played.“So, this year’s quarterfinals are packed with historically overperforming teams. And none of them is called Brazil, England or France. Following the logic of the population size based ratio of World Cup performances this year’s semifinal pairings will be: Uruguay vs Belgium and Croatia vs Sweden.Let that sink in for a minute... Go Uruguay! and greetings from New York.”In the comments, Orlando98 echoes Jan’s sentiments:“I want a Uruguay-Croatia final. Two tiny wee nations punching incredulously above their weight both in terms of performance and also in terms of how many amazing players they produced. Scotland take note.”It’s coming home, etc. etc. Official word from Twitter HQ – there have been half a million mentions of “It’s coming home” in the last 24 hours. And let’s not forget that monster ratings news, with 24 million English TV sets tuning in to watch the historic shoot out. That’s enough to wallop the London Olympics closing ceremony, and dethrone the royal wedding. Here’s Jonathan Wilson on the early exits of Spain and Germany, and what makes the World Cup so unpredictable.Over the past four decades, as club football has become increasingly sophisticated, international football has looked a make-do-and-mend botch job by comparison.That is part of its charm: it’s arguably a greater test of coaching to find a way to cope with a long-term dearth of, say, left-wingers than simply going out and buying one, while the lack of preparation time perhaps introduces a greater element of randomness than is present in the club game.And here’s Stuart James on what Roberto Martínez has to do after Belgium scraped past Japan. Drop Yannick Carrasco? Start Marouane Fellaini? I think we all agree he has to do something.Below the line, chobbes writes:“Can we make today all about puns, like ‘those Swedes have been a real turnip for the books this World Cup’, or ‘Russia have taken all the right steppes so far.’”I usually detest puns, but promise I will put the best (only the best!) ones from the comments up here. It’s punning home? I hate this already. Here’s how we see the teams shaping up. Brazil are still favourites, but France have shot up the rankings with enough speed to attract a shove in the back from Marcos Rojo.Nick Ames’s analysis makes both teams favourites to progress against Uruguay (4th) and Belgium (5th).Read on below:Something to get the conversation started – this piece from Stuart James has clearly struck a chord as we try and digest how to live in this brave new VAR-heavy world. “Everyone’s at it now, including – and let’s not kid ourselves – England players,” he writes. “‘Shithousery” is the word that gets bandied around these days. Others will know it simply as cheating and, sadly, it’s the one cloud that hangs over an otherwise brilliant World Cup in Russia.”But of course, there’s the argument that we’re not seeing elevated levels of shithousery, but it just stands out when everything else has been so heavily policed by VAR. What do you think? Email, tweet or have a go in the comments. Look away Uruguay fans. The latest Cavani injury news is not good. French defender Adil Rami – admittedly, no doctor – has declared that the Uruguayan striker will have to “destroy medical science” if he wants to be fit for tomorrow’s clash with France.The two-goal hero suffered a hamstring injury in his personal demolition of Portugal, and sat out training yesterday. “I had the same kind of injury and it took time,” Rami told Omnisport. “So if he plays against us, he’ll have destroyed science, so stop making us believe that he’ll play against us.“Unfortunately, one man’s loss is another man’s gain,” he said.It’s a shame, given what a joy Cavani was to watch in the round of 16. No shade on Rami, but it should be mentioned for balance that he will of course have to “destroy” the two or three better defenders ahead of him in the squad to also have a chance of starting. And breathe. Here we are. The rest day after the rest day, which if scenes from London are to be believed, wasn’t really a rest day at all. Yes, the round of 16 was fantastic. But the quarter finals start tomorrow, so update that wallchart, eye up the Swedish defence, and shed a tear for James Rodriguez. Can we make this blog anything other than thousands upon thousands of “It’s coming home” memes? I will do it or die trying. Anyway, there’s plenty to ponder. Uruguay v France looks fascinating, and Brazil v Belgium looks a cracker, so we can start the build-up today – a 24 hour, simmering build up slower than Spain against Russia. Am I the Isco of the liveblog team, or the Vladimir Granat (75 minutes, 5 passes attempted, none completed)? Sound off in the comments.We’ll cover the pressing questions of the day. How is Edinson Cavani’s hamstring? How will Roberto Martinez tweak his tactics? How many times can you say “It’s coming home” before I start filtering it out of my email inbox completely?

About 20 people are crowded into this hot, insect-ridden space, and Suleiman worries about the scorpions that come at night.Just days ago, she and her children rushed from their home in Tareeq al-Sad, a rebel-held neighbourhood in Daraa. “We escaped at night, terrified and barefooted,” she says.Her family are among a wave of Syrian civilians who have fled their homes in southern Syria over the past week after a relentless aerial bombardment by forces loyal to the country’s president, Bashar al-Assad. Suleiman knew it was time to leave when she heard the all too familiar din of improvised munitions, known as “elephant rockets” because of the thunderous sound they make. The weapons are among many witnesses say are being used against civilian neighbourhoods in south-west Syria.Daraa was meant to be shielded from the fighting as part of a “de-escalation agreement” brokered last July by Jordan, the US and Russia. But the truce started to unravel last month when a government offensive began targeting the opposition-held part of the province. In the past 10 days, shelling and air raids are believed to have killed more than 200 civilians. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has said at least 17 women and 19 children are among the casualties. As the Syrian regime and its ally Russia continue to pound the rebel enclave, Daraa residents must decide whether to flee or hunker down in their homes. “The situation is beyond comprehension,” says Israa al-Rifai, a local activist who recently escaped with her family to the opposition-held city of Nasib. “People were confused whether to keep their eyes on the sky to watch the warplanes or to get in the car and leave.”Rifai describes watching panicked families piling into trucks at all hours of the day and night. “Women were crying, and children were laughing in the trucks because they didn’t understand what was happening,” she says.For the Assad regime, recapturing this portion of Syria, which borders Israel and Jordan, would mark a strategic and symbolic victory. Daraa is considered the “cradle of the revolution”, and was the epicentre of the 2011 anti-government protests that set in motion Syria’s seven-year war. Since 19 June, the fighting has sent up to 52,000 people into opposition-run areas of south Daraa and Quneitra,according to UN estimates. Jordan, which already hosts an estimated 1.3 million Syrian refugees, said it could not absorb any people now stranded near its northern border.Displaced families have found refuge in schools and government buildings, according to Mousa al-Zoubi, who heads the Daraa provincial council’s newly formed emergency committee. But the majority, he says, are sleeping in the streets and in olive groves: “Their mattresses are the ground and their blankets are in the sky.”The lucky ones are able to buy tents, which street vendors are reportedly selling for as much as $250 (£189) each. Others, like Rifai, brought tents with them. “I had never imagined that one day I would be living in a tent,” she says. “It’s so difficult for me to adapt, but at least I am away from the bombing.”The escalation in fighting has cut off major supply routes, which has led to price hikes on items such as diesel and processed food. The World Food Programme has delivered supplies to 50,000 people through the Ar Ramtha crossing between Jordan and Syria, which spokesperson Marwa Awad says is “the only lifeline now”. The UN, which estimate that 750,000 civilians are at risk in south-west Syria, has warned Daraa could become a repeat of the humanitarian disaster seen in eastern Ghouta earlier this year. Zoubi is calling on the international community to do more to prevent that from happening. “All we’ve heard from international organisations are just promises,” he says. “We are relying on inidual donations to secure the essentials.”Syria’s rebels also feel abandoned. Last month, Reuters reported that the US government told the heads of the Free Syrian Army not to expect any support. Ibrahim al-Jebawi, a former FSA official and current spokesperson for an opposition-linked media group in southern Syria, said he wasn’t surprised. “We’ve never counted on America to intervene. That’s been clear since the first chemical attack on Ghouta in 2013,” he says.He adds that the rebels “will fight until the end, regardless of the US attitude”.Alaa al-Dweri, who repairs motorcycles, described a doomsday scenario playing out in his town of Busra al-Harir, as livestock roamed the streets and families drove to safety in packed cars.Dweri, who doesn’t own a car, managed to get his wife, three children and a few small bags on his motorbike. The family of five headed for Tal Shihab,near Quneitra province, and are staying at a home belonging to friends.“I wish I could have helped other families to escape, but unfortunately I only have this motorbike,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aec8e707026415c06cb3d28cd1fd019ad623f5ff/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0feb664bb57612eea21711872df1cdef","title":"palestinian engineer ashes rubble gaza podcast small changes majd mashharawi","story":"Young social entrepreneur Majd Mashharawi talks about how she transforms the debris left by conflict into eco-friendly housing materials, helping people reconstruct their livesMajd Mashharawi trained as an engineer despite family ambitions for her to become a doctor.

The heat has a way of stunting your appetite, but not eating can make dealing with the heat physically that much more taxing. While consuming your bodyweight in ice-cream – the only edible equivalent of a e into the cold, cold sea – might feel sensible, science and India will tell you that a hot drink is what you need most. And when rail lines are threatening to buckle, using heat of any kind to cook a meal – or just boil the kettle – feels daft. We asked chefs from around the country for their tips on what to eat during a heatwave.A chilled beetroot soup is light, vibrant and quick: sweat red onions and red cabbage until soft then add in raw beetroot, diced very small – to ensure quick cooking – then cook until soft (about five minutes). Cover with boiling water, then cool before blitzing in a blender, with a good dollop of soured cream. Chill until cold, season to taste with salt and lime juice and top with chopped chives and more soured cream to serve.Quick-fry sliced garlic in olive oil, then turn off the heat and add finely chopped tomatoes and leave for 30 seconds. Stir in a handful of basil, roughly chopped, and season to taste. Toss through the pasta of your choice, finish with a drizzle of olive oil and – if you can face making them – a scattering of breadcrumbs.My go-to is a salad of fridge-cold green leaves – little gem is a good choice – torn into biggish pieces, fresh peas, broad beans and radishes, with a dressing of fridge-cold buttermilk (or, in a pinch, yoghurt), which naturally has such a cooling flavour, seasoned with salt, pepper and lime or lemon juice. Served with sourdough bread and a glass of rosé. Light, fresh, cooling.Take a ripe pineapple – it must be ripe – and peel it, then place it in the freezer overnight. The next day, grate it, and you get an instant granita. Delicious with some chopped fresh mint or basil folded through it. Serve in a tall Sunday glass with creme fraiche, some finely sliced fresh pineapple, a few sprigs of fresh mint and a sprinkling of palm sugar. Spicy food cools you down by raising your core temperature and making you sweat: it causes your body to self-regulate. So, I’d opt for a Thai-style som tam salad: mix green mango and papaya, shredded, with lots of fresh coriander and peanuts. Dress with palm sugar, lots of red chilli, garlic, tomato and lots of lime juice, pounded together in a pestle and mortar to balance out the hot, sour, sweet and salty flavours.When it’s hot, we need more liquid and less alcohol, so a good, easy cocktail is something fortified – sherry, port, vermouth, Campari, martini – on the rocks, topped up with tonic water, soda, lemonade or a mix of all three, garnished with whatever you have to hand – a slice of orange or lemon, a sprig of mint or rosemary. For something very low-alcohol, tonic water with angostura bitters is great – the alcoholic content is minimal because you only need a few drops.Whizz up some almonds in blender – either blanched or ground – to obtain a paste, then very slowly add water to get a smooth soup. Season with sherry vinegar, a little crushed garlic, a little olive oil and some salt. Ladle into bowls and top with fresh fruit – cherries, grapes or, my favourite, really cold sweet melon. Drizzle with olive oil to serve. It is vegan and beautifully cooling.Fresh, raw, good-quality veg, which is bountiful in farmers’ markets right now, keeps well at room temperature: try tomatoes, spring onions, shaved artichokes, green beans and lightly blanched broad beans with loads of fresh herbs, dressed half an hour before you eat with olive oil, salt, lemon juice and zest or, if tomatoes, some chardonnay vinegar. Very little prep, which means more time outdoors.Pan-fried dover sole – or blonde ray, an excellent alternative to skate – is delicious at this time of year. And the beauty of cooking fish in the heat is that it is so quick: 4 minutes on either side and you’re sorted. Fry it on the bone so it retains its moisture then flake and stir through a fresh garden-pea salad, with some finely sliced raw shallots, fresh goats cheese, olive oil, salt and pepper. Add in some finely sliced red chilli to spice it up a bit if you like, and a little crispy bacon, or cured ham.You don’t need as much sustenance in the heat as you do in the cold, so fresh, green things are best – they’re satisfying, but also keep you feeling awake and light. And the most cooling veg is kohlrabi. Find a small one (red or white), peel it and slice very thinly. Lay out on a plate and dress with olive oil and lemon juice, then dot with fresh ricotta or – my favourite – sprouted puy lentils. And to drink, place sprigs of lemon verbena in a jug of ice-water. Beats lemon slices and cucumber hands down.The crucible of Indian eating is the constant heatwave – even in the winter, it’s hot. So, much of the food we make is geared towards cooling. One of the things my mother and grandmother always made me is lassi. Make the base mixing one part low-fat yoghurt with one part soy milk. Flavour with rose water, crushed green cardamom pods and pomegranate juice and season with a pinch of salt and some sugar, which realigns your electrolytes.Salad is an obvious choice, as is cured meat – both stand up well in the heat. In Italy, prosciutto is given to hospital patients: it’s very nutritious and highly digestible, which is also key when it’s very hot. If you are going to cook, it needs to be something very quick. I like to cook whole courgettes – the small, thin ones – very quickly in boiling water, with a little salt, for two minutes, then drain them and leave them to cool, before slicing them lengthways. I dress them with salsa verde – anchovy, parsley and mint – and serve with prosciutto on the side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7252d98f8b90e6d3a44d703cf8bd916d7499c0f/0_51_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed738590364fb1162dffea2b7ee00f3a","title":"la croix fizzy flavoured water","story":"The sugar-free, flavoured drink is gaudy, moreish and huge in LA. But is it because of the look, or the taste?Still or sparkling? It’s a seemingly innocent question with an answer that can ide tables and draw lines through groups of friends. Like an old-fashioned game of Would You Rather, your answer is a signifier, the same as cats or dogs (dogs) and Whitney or Mariah (Whitney). Still or sparkling? Always sparkling.Fizzy water inspires zealotry. But few things sound more tame, or suggest that I’m definitely past my Saturn Return, than being #obsessed with seltzer. Cue La Croix, the sugar-free, flavoured sparkling water that has bubbled its way into the lives of, well, seemingly all Americans in the past three years. Among millennials, it is little short of a religion.I can see why. From its lurid Miami-Vice-meets-Fat-Willy’s branding to the multicoloured cans, each delineating one of its 21 flavours (including coconut, peach-pear and passionfruit), La Croix is a siren of a beverage to look at – and that’s before you taste it. I first tried it on a trip to LA, where a friend had just been through a dramatic breakup that revolved around a pair of La Croix branded socks. I’ll admit I was dubious about it – flavoured waters had always grossed me out (I’m looking at you, Volvic Touch of Fruit) – but the sock story was intriguing and I needed to know more.It had me at the grapefruit – or “naturally pamplemousse-essenced” (despite this quasi-French vibe, it is pronounced without the “X” – “Croy”, as in Croydon). I was hooked. On first sip, I found the happy spritz of fizzy water with the added dimension of a fruity flavour, but not – and this is important – the sweetness of pops and sodas. In the wake of sugar taxes and countless clean-living social media feeds, La Croix has stepped in as a viable alternative to Fanta et al, not to mention booze, without being “just water”. It’s gaudy yet wholesome, moreish but good for you– “methadone for the soda addict”, as one journalist put it. Everyone’s a winner.Despite its stratospheric rise to prominence, La Croix is not new. It started in Wisconsin in 1981 and for a long time was just-another-water-brand, beloved of midwestern soccer moms. In 2015, it became a breakout hit, quickly becoming the darling of coastal creatives, celebrities and Instagram. Plaudits came in the form of an independent clothing line, La Croixs Over Boys a skit between Miley Cyrus and Jimmy Fallon on the Tonight Show, and many songs by – usually male – fans taking ownership of their favourite beverage. “When you’re sippin’ on La Croix  You know it brings you joy,” sings YouTuber Rakeem. Yes, yes it does.It has not been without its controversies either, and just this week CEO of La Croix parent company National Beverage Nick Caporella has been accused of sexual harassment (allegations which he denies). The water isn’t available in the UK, but if you don’t mind flavours such as cucumber – which somehow don’t seem nearly trashy-fun enough – fizzy water brands such as Dash make good alternatives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eafa44176bd7c30910bc46d943163caa8873ef0/32_61_3934_2360/master/3934.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d71f82eab27b8020de080a6bc61471cc","title":"bbc teen viewers box sets iplayer netflix","story":"New teen section of iPlayer will target younger viewers who currently favour NetflixThe BBC is stepping up its rivalry with Netflix and YouTube to win back teenage audiences by making box sets of bingeable “rite of passage” shows covering subjects such as sex education, cars and alcohol for a new teen section of BBC iPlayer.The new programmes – two of which will be presented by YouTube vloggers – will be available on a new section on BBC iPlayer and – unlike other shows on the platform, which can only be accessed for up to 30 days – will remain there for up to five years.With the corporation recently revealing that more younger viewers are watching Netflix than all of its TV services, BBC Children’s head of content, Cheryl Taylor, said the proliferation of new platforms highlighted the gap in the choice of programmes available for those too old for children’s channels CBeebies and CBBC and too young for BBC3, which is aimed at 16- to 34-year-olds. “You don’t see ordinary teens that much on the BBC or shows about those kind of coming-of-age, sensitive subjects, which are key at a really important time in children’s lives … it’s important we remain relevant to all children,” said Taylor.The BBC has traditionally been deterred from airing more grown-up programmes on CBBC – which is for 6- to 12-year-olds – and on iPlayer because, Taylor said, “we don’t want to upset children and show them inappropriate content”. Other highlights range from summer-camp drama The A List, to Teen Taxi – a sort of Gogglebox meets Car Share real-life series that “will shine a humorous and engaging light on the conversations had between teenagers and their parents as they travel in their family cars”. Also on offer is a “junior Panorama”-style documentary series covering subjects such as teenagers emerging from foster care, boys becoming men, and life in eco-communities. CBBC doctors Chris and Xand van Tulleken will front special programmes on mental health and alcohol. Taylor said the YouTubers were chosen because they were already role models who influence children, but both she and BBC Children’s head of discovery, Stuart Rowson, said they hoped the BBC would grow its own influencers of the future. It is vital for the BBC’s future to bridge the gap for teenagers to stop them deserting the corporation as they are the licence fee payers of the future. Tony Hall, the director general, recently said that with the rise in power of US tech giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, the BBC had “a fight on our hands … a fight for the future of not just the BBC, but public service broadcasting in Britain”.Hall said the corporation risked being overtaken by competitors after finding that 16- to 24-year-olds spent more time with Netflix in a week than with all of BBC TV including the BBC iPlayer. Rowson said: “We need to react to the way young audiences are consuming content. This will give them bespoke content they can access on iPlayer, which has traditionally been a catchup service but is now working to become a video-on-demand service that we hope teenagers will go to as their default destination.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

And in its shadow, here we are too.Welcome to another mob-handed, obsessively planned, lovingly curated effort to bring you the  and Observer’s World Cup coverage in every conceivable form, to your every conceivable screen. This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business. Asking our readers to become subscribers, or to contribute to pay for something they value is, in our opinion, the best way forward. So if you like this stuff and think it’s worth helping it to continue, then why not make an additional contribution to the . It only takes a minute and can be as little as £1 if you’re particularly tight or shameless. Yes, sport can be seen as a glorious irrelevance, but it also says something about who we are.

Perhaps it lights up your enjoyment via the frankly brilliant reporting of our football hacks, led of course (damn him) by annual award hoover Danny Taylor, and backed up by the likes of Dominic Fifield, Martha Kelner, Dave Hytner, Stuart James and, with the long range heavy artillery, the mind bogglingly good Marina Hyde.

I have been at that door so many times. The one you walk through into his apartment, or let him through into yours, and something shifts. It’s as quick as\u0026nbspthe click when the optometrist slides a new lens into the eye-test machine: a clear, almost weightless little sliver of a thing, but with the power to make the world resolve into clarity – or blur out, leaving you nauseous and unbalanced.Once, it was the door to the celebrated journalist’s apartment that I stumbled through, aged 21. I’d taken a\u0026nbsptrain to New York to meet him for career advice and, unexpectedly, he had suggested we meet at a bar, then bought me several martinis. But then again, I drank them. Whose fault was the sex that ensued? And then there was the door to an AirBnB I rented in Uruguay in\u0026nbsp2014, with a pushy local journalist I had just met trailing behind me. As I fumbled with my keys, I\u0026nbspremember thinking: how did I get here?Me too. Isn’t that frightening? That almost every woman today can say these words? Finally, we are having a conversation about the sexual harassment – and\u0026nbspthe sexual encounters – that have left us feeling damaged. And yet there’s a kind of uncertainty still hovering around the unfolding conversation – something still tucked into the shadows. Some people have said women are being inconsistent, re-remembering encounters they hadn’t had a problem with at the time. Others wonder why women – particularly young women – are feeling so fragile, acting as if they have been terribly wounded by something as apparently minor as a leer.Complaints about boorish behaviour or lame one-night stands, this critique goes, have the potential not\u0026nbsponly to delegitimise real accusations of rape, but #MeToo’s whole message. When a writer recently accused the novelist Junot Díaz of “forcibly kissing” her\u0026nbsp(which he denied) and other women came forward to say Díaz had acted aggressively towards them in public, a\u0026nbspfriend of mine in her 40s – a feminist who writes with empathy about women who kill their abusive partners – worried that Diaz was being pilloried for “assholery”, not\u0026nbsplegally actionable crimes. Just after saying that, though, this friend began to recount her own first kiss. The boy had shoved her hard up against a fence. She started to laugh, as if to pass\u0026nbspit off as a wacky youthful memory, like a\u0026nbspzit popping during a job interview. But it was clear something in her still wanted to cry.The problem is, it’s this ill-defined area between “assholery” and attempted rape that troubles many women. This is hard to talk about, and increasingly so, as we perceive the damage that just remembering can apparently wreak. When I asked if it was “the right time” to write about my experience with the New York journalist, another male writer said to me, “Hell, no!”, telling me that “careers are being ruined”. But I don’t want to ruin anybody’s career.We are having these conversations at last, but we are not talking much about the historical context. I think this is the key to understanding how women are feeling now. For me, born in 1983, the context was the 90s – a peculiar era, caught between the confidence that there had been fabulous progress in the relationship between the sexes, and the smouldering remnants of a past in which bold women were feared and ridiculed.In the 1990s, the pressure on young people to succeed was intense. Women’s bodies and their sexual choices became the focus of ever-harsher scrutiny, and the expectation was that they would be perfect.I remember leaving my childhood home for college in\u0026nbsp2001. Among the items I packed were a pair of what everybody then was calling “fuck-me boots”: knee-high black leather boots with a four-inch heel. Like my textbooks, I felt the fuck-me boots were preparing me for adulthood – for a decisive step out of the self-doubt of my teens. It wasn’t that I associated adulthood with fucking. It was more that I was determined to become the kind of woman who was fuckable in just the right way. I still remember the look I gave myself in the mirror I’d pasted on the back of my dorm-room door the first night I put the boots on, to wear to a frat party, along with a slash of lipstick in berry pink. It was a look of wonder and hope: it felt like a magic mirror, and with those boots on I\u0026nbspcould stare myself into what I wanted to become.The hopes of the end of the millennium were the mirror in\u0026nbspwhich I saw myself. But the young woman there was only a picture. In flesh and blood, by the time I became a woman, I had already been singed by those smouldering embers of the past. And thus, I entered adulthood as two people: the image my era wanted me to be, and the other woman, the hidden one, the one with a body.It’s 1993. I’m almost 10. In apartments across the US, Madonna’s new book, Sex, graces coffee tables, the cover depicting her in the throes of an orgasm. My family has just moved from the city to a house in the suburbs. My parents gave me – the child – the “master bedroom”. It had a wall-length closet covered in mirrored doors. I woke up every day staring at myself.It was a narcissistic decade, but it was a strange narcissism, premised on the idea we could remake ourselves any way we liked, virtually from scratch. People came home from vacations in Germany with pieces of the Berlin Wall the feeling was not that they’d got a memento of German reunification, but a piece of the ultimate wall, some figurative wall whose crumbling represented the tumbling-down of a whole world. My\u0026nbspfather, a former Reagan administration official, filled\u0026nbspup our house with kitsch he found on trips to Moscow. Muddling around for the house keys, I’d touch medallions of Stalin and Lenin in the bowl in the hall.The message I got from these objects was that enmity, conflict, maybe even pain – all the kinds of things my parents told me they’d had to fear as kids in the early 60s, when their schoolteachers made them hide under their desks in case of a Soviet nuke – were all some kind of big joke. We could keep Stalin in our house as an amusement, like\u0026nbspthose 19th-century Europeans who displayed the shrunken heads of conquered Polynesian tribes.Unmanageable male lust was one of those things we hoped would become a kind of relic that we didn’t take all that seriously. Men in that decade’s pop culture tended to be\u0026nbspharmless – think the goofs of Seinfeld and Friends. One of the bestselling American books of the early 90s, You Just Don’t Understand: Women and Men in Conversation, reassured readers that resolving miscommunications between the sexes was actually easy, if we just understood how to do it. Solutions were big then. A couples therapist named Harville Hendrix sold hundreds of thousands of copies of a guide called Getting the Love You Want, which unravelled “the mystery of romantic attraction” and answered “humanity’s yearning” in just 384 pages.I remember my early girlhood as surrounded by a shimmering halo of possibility. Explaining the long-term inconveniences of an oesophageal surgery I’d had as an infant, my pediatrician told me with a wink that the only thing I could never be was an astronaut: as if, without that\u0026nbsplittle fault, I’d have definitely gone to Mars. My friends and I loved the cartoon The PowerPuff Girls: “Sugar, spice, and everything nice,” the narrator intoned. “These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girl. But Prof Utonium accidentally added a can of whoopass to the concoction!” The PowerPuff Girls combined traditional female perfection (Mary Jane shoes, pigtails) with post-feminist female badassery (they whooped bad guys).The success of MTV’s Real World – not, it was clear, real – confirmed that reality didn’t really matter the only things that had to be real were our dreams. Oprah was the preacher of that decade. She told us we just didn’t have to\u0026nbspbelieve in bad things any more. Fear, she said, was a\u0026nbspuseless emotion it was all in our minds. Failure and lasting heartbreak were the monsters of the human childhood, which just vanished as soon as we opened the closet door. Her frequent guest, the motivational author Iyanla Vanzant, told a live audience in New York: “You can use words to totally redefine reality. What I do when I hear myself say ‘can’t’ is, I cancel it out. Cancel the word. Cancel the thought. You shouldn’t have any ‘problem’. ‘Problem’ means you are powerless. ‘Problem’ means you are weak. Say ‘ine opportunity’.”It wasn’t clear how men would fit into the picture of young 90s women’s futures. What guy on Seinfeld or the Simpsons could keep up with an ambitious woman? The lead male character in American Pie, the classic 90s comedy, tried to fornicate with a pastry.In sex education classes, we spent endless time watching videos of sperm penetrating an egg, or labelling diagrams of the testes there was no sense of a real man connected to these sexual organs, but there was a firm message of fear. Our instructors terrified us with stories of how condoms could fail, exposing us to STIs that would destroy our potential we were taught about sex in the same classes as hard-drug awareness, implying it was a bit like cocaine, a quick thrill that could prove ruinous.Though we were supposed to be the first generation that didn’t need men in a material sense, my friends and I in high school were absolutely obsessed with guys. We talked about little else. We didn’t know what men were for, but I think we wondered whether they could turn out\u0026nbspto be the secret key – a kind of final stage in our self-development, or a confirmation that we had become as awesome as we were supposed to be. When I think back to that time, I remember a scene from my favorite teen TV show, Dawson’s Creek. Pacey, a boy, tried to tell two of his female friends about a serial killer who was reportedly stalking the region. “He cuts out women’s hearts,” he warned. Joey, a girl, just laughed. Jen, the other girl, smiled beatifically and said: “He’s probably just looking for love.” A powerful enough woman, in other words, could be a literal alchemist, turning even the worst heart-eating murderer into a good guy.Female ambition was purportedly encouraged. But when it actually manifested in a real woman, it was often depicted as deadly, contradictory or grotesque. When Fergie, the Duchess of York, tried to recover from her orce by entering business, a nasty Independent article, written by two women, mocked her efforts: “Goodness, she would have a jolly good go at anything!” Donald Trump had a tower and a plane, but it was Imelda Marcos, the wife of Philippine dictator Ferdinand, with her vast collection of shoes, who became the decade’s symbol of\u0026nbspgreed. In her 1991 biography of Nancy Reagan, Kitty Kelley accused the president’s wife of secretly “ruling the White House with a Gucci-clad fist”. Diana was applauded for rejecting her ugly prince. But she was also\u0026nbsppainted as reckless for getting killed with her playboy lover in a car chase with paparazzi.Around the time the Bobbitts were in the news, I\u0026nbspstarted to become very fearful. I wrote diary entries. Anxiety – over my grades, over the need to be perfect – was a theme. “I will get better and better at sledding,” I encouraged myself. I impressed on myself the need to be good, even at the things I did just for fun. “Goals: to work harder. Spend more time on homework and less time drifting away and ending up with my nose in a book.” After a report card came home, I mourned: “As the grownups say, I\u0026nbspam not living up to my potential.” I was eight years old.Coexisting with the sense of limitless possibility was a\u0026nbspstrong counterstrain of dread. If life in the late 20th century could theoretically be perfect, then any wrong step was potentially catastrophic. On an Oprah episode called Stranger Danger, an “anti-abduction” specialist taught a group of very young children how to evade potential kidnappers by doing things such as jumping into rubbish bins or kicking out the brake lights of the car if a paedophile locked them in the boot. “Fantastic way to signal the police,” he’d say.The kids in the show, though, struggled to contain giggles. In that situation, who would remember to kick out the brake light? I remember learning stuff like this – the sinkholes to misfortune I might stumble across in the\u0026nbspfuture, and how to tiptoe around them – and just laughing, too. It felt so much easier, and more powerful, to imagine danger just didn’t exist or could be risen above, as the girls in Dawson’s Creek did, than to acknowledge we could screw up our glittering destinies.At 16, I got my first boyfriend. But I couldn’t enjoy it. I\u0026nbspwas timid and terrified, unable to voice my feelings or concerns. I felt muzzled by contradictions: love could be everything love was a distraction. He wasn’t the right guy he might be the right guy and I would blow it. I had become detached from my real instincts, because love was an achievement, rated, in some vague way, by outside forces.When my boyfriend grew depressed and increasingly angry, I felt I had to figure out how his behaviour was actually due to my actions. As a young woman, the infinite power I’d been told I had turned out to have given me infinite responsibility – and that was a terrible burden. He was like a gear in the complicated but glorious machine I was assembling called my life, and if\u0026nbsphe went wonky, it must be my fault.I spent a lot of time sobbing in car parks. When I broke up with him, I brought him a fruit basket. I wanted so much for a bad thing to be good, to make\u0026nbspa “ine opportunity”. As I got in my car to leave, he threw himself under the front wheels. The emotion I\u0026nbsprecall is numbness, a sense of profound dissociation. The more messed-up the evening got, the\u0026nbspmore I had to pretend it was almost funny, a “crazy” story I would later tell my girlfriends – proof of promising qualities I had been assured of in magazine personality quizzes, like adventurousness and\u0026nbspa willingness to let life\u0026nbspunfurl in all its wackiness.The writer Andrew Solomon has explored the lives of\u0026nbspprodigies, gifted children burdened from a very young age by great expectations. The\u0026nbspexperience, he writes, is “isolating, mystifying, petrifying”. I think many millennial women, and not\u0026nbspjust the wealthiest ones, had youths a little like prodigies. We were invested with the hope that the suffering of generations of women who had gone before us hadn’t been in vain. Recently, a friend told me that her mother got into Harvard in the 1970s but chose not to go because of the explicit inequalities for women that remained there. “They had a male-only library. She wasn’t allowed to be in the marching band,” she said. My friend felt that her mother was in awe – even jealous – of our condition, apparently freed from that overt discrimination. My friend recalled that she grew up being told: “This is\u0026nbsphow good you get it. You get\u0026nbspto live in this time when\u0026nbspeverything is possible.”My mother, the nerdy daughter of penniless Polish immigrants, loved literature and music. But, when she applied to college, her father insisted she study science, and she did so, because daddy was still king in the 60s. Defeated, she dropped out. She felt, I think, trailed by the shadow of opportunities denied. Her determination that I\u0026nbspnot screw up my special opportunity became, at times, overwhelming. When I came home with a B in geometry, I got chewed out as if I had written off the car. When I\u0026nbsplooked deep into my mother’s eyes, sometimes I\u0026nbspthought I saw a plea: tell me you are going to make it.It sounds paradoxical, but all the power we were told\u0026nbspwe had led often not to courage, but to hesitation, rationalisation, even self-hatred and self-harm. It was portrayed as a liberation to have the chance to be everything all at once, brainy and gorgeous. But in practice, it was crushing: if we could be anything, we had to be ideal.The beauty rituals of the 90s focused on scraping, plucking and driving out. We knew we had to be godly, so we became like monks, obsessed with flaying ourselves and exorcising the evidence of sin within us in the form of stray hairs and blackheads, which we cruelly tried to rip off of our delicate faces with special tape. Our 90s models of beauty – Kate Moss, Posh Spice – were hollow-eyed, so blemishless and skinny that they seemed to be melting away. The beloved teen magazine Seventeen played the role of our advisor on romance, and it was a harsh tutor, reminding us incessantly of all the ways we could fail. One recurring feature was the quiz, dedicated to helping young women identify and root out their neuroticisms. “Quiz: Do You Play Mind Games?”, “Are\u0026nbspYou Overreacting?”, “Are You Paranoid?” Another feature was “550 Guys on First Moves and the Worst Thing a Girl Could Do”.We were rated on everything. I got graded at summer camp. In high school, we took the Myers-Briggs type-indicator test, which adjudicated our entire personalities and generated quantitative values for our traits we could even be rated on how much we liked to have fun. This was the insidiousness of the decade’s philosophy: in\u0026nbspthe guise of liberation, it swallowed up everything and\u0026nbspdirected it towards incessant self-perfection.Educators who work with prodigies know they often become paralysed because any action at all would be a betrayal of the ideal performance. Or they start to sabotage themselves. In an environment where being extraordinary is never quite enough, being dramatically, pointedly off the mark – even damaging oneself – becomes a way to get attention. One friend told me recently that she cried many evenings, while in high school, over the need to walk an incredibly fine line between being too “prude” and too “slutty”. Another friend began to cut herself. Many girls I knew did. Young-adult novels began to proliferate in which the teenage protagonists became grievously ill, bedridden or died.We longed so much to step or fall off the narrow tightropes we walked. In the early days of the internet, a\u0026nbsplot of kids my age took a quiz called the “Purity Test”. Among the hundreds of questions were ones such as:“Have you used a drug to lower someone’s inhibitions about sexual activity?”“Have you had sex with a woman who was asleep and she didn’t wake up?”“Have you ever accepted money for sex?”“Have you ever masturbated into a houseplant?”It wasn’t entirely clear whether it was good or bad to get a low score – to be “pure” – but I recall it was judicious to be pure and cool to be impure, and we kind of had to be both.The people who designed the purity test were high achievers: students at MIT. I suspect the test reflected fantasies of getting off the dizzying fast track. But it’s telling, and sad, that their fooling around also yielded a\u0026nbspgrade. In the end, “impurity” was just another proof of\u0026nbspaccomplishment. In the test’s logic, prostitution and\u0026nbsprape were almost wickedly charming, marks of daredevil extraordinariness. Early on in the iconic 90s film American Beauty, Angela, the movie’s ingenue, fields creepy attention from an older, married man. She\u0026nbspconverts that problem into a ine opportunity.“If people I don’t even know look at me and want to fuck me, I really have a shot at being a model, which is great!” she says. “Because there’s nothing worse in life than being ordinary.”Years later, in 2014, on a reporting trip to Montevideo, I\u0026nbsphosted a dinner for local artists and journalists. One of them gave me the eye across the table. We ended up at a bar. He walked me home to my AirBnB. We went upstairs. I\u0026nbsprecall these steps as feeling both discomfiting and inevitable, as if someone else was moving my feet. The\u0026nbspwhole time I walked, I thought brightly: I can always go back.But I couldn’t. My first step towards the AirBnB had arisen from a wish to be fancy-free – but then it became a\u0026nbsprule. For if I’d had the power in that situation, then I’d have been able to make the best choice at any given time. To stop walking, to change my mind, was to admit that I had made a mistake, been stupid – a crippling admission.After I let him into my AirBnB, he dropped his pants and blocked the door with his body. Now this was real. This was bad. This was the point at which I was supposed to kick out the brake light of the car to signal the police. But all I could manage was to feebly voice what had become for me, by then, a go-to excuse for ending such encounters: that my vagina was broken. I said it had a “disorder”.Unfortunately, my excuse didn’t work. He just grinned and said: “Maybe mine will be the dick that will fix that for you.” Horrible – but wasn’t that kind of always the hope? That a man would come along and put the last piece into the not-yet-quite-perfect puzzle of our feminine lives?It felt awkward, even childish, to hit him or to scream. I also felt I owed him a long explanation for my inconsistency, even though I had not yet managed to explain it to myself. Suffocating under contradictions, I just lay back and resigned myself. I think so many of us resigned ourselves to situations that were wrong, not because we were powerless, but because we thought this was the way for us to experience our power. To shove the man, or\u0026nbspto scream, felt like an admission to myself I had misjudged the situation in the first place, and I’d always\u0026nbspbeen taught that to lose control of a situation was\u0026nbspa mark on your character. A failure.I trekked to his office the next morning to return a\u0026nbspsweater he’d left behind. He gave me a warm smile, which I returned with a queasy one. I didn’t know what\u0026nbspto think of myself, and in that void, I didn’t want to seem inconsistent. I think he thought my solicitousness meant I’d had a good time. And why shouldn’t he have? How could he have known all the fears and concerns I\u0026nbsphad brought in with me to that AirBnB, when we, as\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspculture, go so terribly far to conceal them?But I’ve thought of Montevideo during the #MeToo conversation. There are many of these kinds of ambiguous yet heartbreaking encounters that women have not yet\u0026nbspvoiced. Some commentators have fretted about “evolving standards” – as if all of a sudden women just decided that things they used to be cool with aren’t so cool any more. There is surprise at some of the #MeToo stories – when strong women such as Amy Schumer reveal that they endured abuse, sometimes for years. But it all makes sense to me. We aren’t changing our standards. We are remembering things. Why should we be surprised that women are only now remembering, or understanding, what really happened to them, when, in the time that so many of us came of age, we told ourselves that everything we knew about life and human behaviour could be forgotten, that we had left the past behind?How many times have I recounted a truly scary or hurtful encounter with a man to my girlfriends as a jolly story? But, it turns out, it just isn’t funny or adventurous to see your boss masturbate on a houseplant. It’s traumatic. There are, perhaps, only so many times a woman can deny the impact of such experiences before she loses it. Every one of them dredges up the memories of the others, cumulatively, until one day a stranger whistles at you on\u0026nbspthe street, or you read an account of some random celebrity’s misdeeds, and you find yourself raving on Twitter like a person who has been halfway destroyed.Yes, some of these experiences are minor. But what’s\u0026nbspbehind them is not. Love as triumph, love as ruin. Sex as\u0026nbspweightless, sex as incredibly freighted. Men\u0026nbspas pointless, men as the whole point of life’s game.\u0026nbspWomen\u0026nbspas witches, magicians women so fragile they\u0026nbspcut themselves open in high-school bathrooms. Women as careful, women as\u0026nbspcarefree.In some of the #MeToo critiques, I perceive an anger that younger women weren’t the perfectly empowered people their elders had hoped they would be. The older generation had prepared the ground, after all, and fought their battles. To acknowledge how younger women have struggled would entail a painful admission that the battles of previous generations may not have been won as decisively as they had hoped. We were told, decades ago, that we were starring in a totally new story, and that we didn’t have to experience any of these painful conflicts. But that only made our ultimate experience of them more painful.Nine months after it began, I sense an ebbing of some energy around #MeToo – a tiredness perhaps an acknowledgement that the\u0026nbspcontradictions and painful realities it revealed are too big to solve fast. Frantically firing offending males may make it harder for women to tell their complex stories. But the suffering of men who have been publicly accused of sexual assault or misconduct must not shut us up now, either. I want more stories. I want more curiosity about the complexity of\u0026nbspwomen’s lives – instead of a\u0026nbsppanicky retreat from the conversation.We would like to believe that clearer rules around “positive consent” will put an end to much of this difficulty. But I worry a little about “positive consent”. It still puts the onus on the woman to perfectly manage the situation – this time with non-verbal cues, communicating desire or retreat with a flicker of the eye. It wasn’t a better description of “consent” that I needed while growing up. I was taught endlessly what I should and shouldn’t consent to for my life not to go wrong. All that emphasis on all my power to make things turn out right ended up paralysing me.I lacked a perception of what I wanted. I think that’s one of the things that lurks in the shadows of #MeToo. How to enable young people to discover what they really want and need out of love and sex – this is what we should be talking about in sex-education classes. Forget about putting condoms on bananas. But as long as we venerate doing and solving – making things more efficient and perfect – it will be hard to glimpse what we\u0026nbspreally want out of sex or of love.Main illustration by Nate Kitch• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25292123e78e237b6c87a61c345a5ddba6ba0b81/0_0_2000_1558/master/2000.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e05aec1f80deb2c68429185b109dda3 720w","title":"another pmqs brings the end of days closer for theresa may","story":"Her cabinet are barely speaking and Esther McVey has been accused of deliberately misleading parliamentWe are reaching the end of days. Theresa May’s authority diminishes by the day. Her cabinet is barely speaking to one another and body bags have been ordered in for Friday’s Chequers mini-break. Esther McVey has been accused of deliberately misleading parliament about Universal Credit by the National Audit Office. Vote Leave has been accused of breaking the electoral rules on campaign spending. And Jeremy Corbyn is asking questions about buses. Six of them. You wait for one question about buses…Not that there is anything intrinsically wrong with using prime minister’s questions to wrong-foot May over buses. A large number of people depend on public transport to get around and bus services have become increasingly unreliable in many areas. Maybe, though, just one or two questions would have been enough. Then move on to trains, if you like. Chris Grayling’s job is hanging by a thread over his mishandling of the railways. But once you’ve done all that, just don’t forget to mention the war.As a general rule of thumb, a leader of the opposition is best off asking the questions a prime minister least wants to answer. And May is very happy not answering questions about buses. She doesn’t know anything about buses and she doesn’t care about buses because none of her MPs are giving her a hard time about buses. Tory voters, by and large, travel by car.The first question about buses received an answer about the NHS. May was only trying to be helpful. She didn’t have anything to say about buses but she knew she had to say something and she hoped the NHS would do. It wouldn’t. Corbyn pressed her again. The prime minister shrugged. She hadn’t a clue about local bus services in Cornwall. Were they the ones with £350m pasted on the side?Corbyn then went for a quick-fire round. The number 38 service in Greater Manchester. How many buses an hour? Pass. How many people had died because they couldn’t get to hospital? Pass. By the end, May looked positively cheerful. She’d come to PMQs expecting to be given a hard time. Public services falling apart were a breeze compared to the government falling apart.It took Owen Paterson, one of the hardline Brexiters in her own party, to ask the question she really didn’t want to answer. Would she sack any member of her cabinet who dared to propose a soft Brexit, and could she commit to keeping her election promise of bankrupting the country by leaving the single market and the customs union?May looked temporarily panicked and closed her eyes in fright. Hoping that when she reopened them, Paterson would have disappeared. But then she remembered there was no promise she had ever made that she hadn’t subsequently broken. So she might as well make another promise that she would break and tell him exactly what he wanted to hear. Maybot is as Maybot does. We’d definitely be leaving the single market and the customs union apart from the bits of them we might be staying in.As MPs became overwhelmed with the futility of the occasion and began drifting off to lunch, Labour’s Marsha de Cordova went for the jugular. It was clear that Esther McVey had broken the ministerial code was the prime minister going to sack her? May reverted to her default algorithm. “It’s very clear,” she said. McVey had only made a teensy-weensy mistake by twice misleading parliament and everyone deserved a second chance. So the work and pensions secretary would be making a half-hearted apology as a brief point of order at the end of PMQs. Was that OK?McVey, aka The Duracell Bunny, was quick to disabuse the prime minister. Her apology was going to be virtually non-existent, not half-hearted. “Yeahbutnobutyeahbutnobutyeahbutsowhat?” she said defiantly as the Labour benches called for her to resign. She wasn’t sorry. She’d never been sorry. The people who hadn’t got their universal credit payments on time deserved to starve. And she was going nowhere. Partly because she was entirely without shame. But also because the prime minister was too feeble to do the right thing. End of days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc8bde9481dd8bf96f45143faeb6c12904717fc4/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01ebbf3c547a7e28a633abe1f6e2f0b5","title":"len mccluskey signs letter accusing trans rights activists of intimidation","story":"Unite union leader later clarifies position saying he opposes ‘all hate crime including against trans people’Britain’s most powerful union leader has joined a group of feminist campaigners to sign a controversial letter that accuses some transgender rights activists of violent and intimidating behaviour.The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, was one of about 140 people, including Julie Bindel and Ruth Serwotka, who signed a letter in the Morning Star warning that a handful of recent episodes risked drawing “the whole of our progressive movement into disrepute”.The letter highlights a series of recent incidents, including the conviction of Tara Wood, 26, in April for the assault of Maria MacLachlan “a 60-year-old woman who had gathered with others in order to attend a meeting” to discuss “the potential impact on women and girls” of changes to the Gender Recognition Act.It also described a confrontation on a Bectu union picket line in March, saying that “trans activists, with no connection to the industrial dispute itself, mobbed and verbally attacked a female trade union member on the basis of having recognised her as an attendee at a similar meeting”.McCluskey initially said he had signed the letter “to improve the climate of debate around proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act” but immediately faced criticism for signing a document that appeared to make little reference to transgender rights.Laura Murray, the head of external relations in the office of Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted: “I’m apparently ‘disgusting’ and ‘not a feminist or a socialist’ because I stand against transphobia. But according to today’s letter in the Morning Star, all abusive behaviour in this debate comes from trans activists! Jesus wept.”The union leader clarified his position, tweeting that “I oppose all hate crime including against trans people” and said that Unite, whose policy conference is going on a Brighton, had agreed a more conciliatory “executive statement”.That asserted: “We oppose ision between our Women’s movement and our Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans movement, our campaigns to tackle discrimination are inclusive and member led.”Ministers this week launched a long expected consultation on potential changes to the Gender Recognition Act 2004 that would make it easier for transgender people to achieve legal recognition of an acquired gender – a prospect that has caused intense debate since it was first mooted in 2016.The act already allows people to change their gender without first having had surgical treatment, but since it came into force, 4,910 people have legally changed their gender, partly because it requires people to provide medical reports and other documentation to prove they have been living in their acquired gender for two years.Many feminists have questioned the implications of making it easier for people to reassign their gender, questioning for example whether it is appropriate to share women only spaces with male bodied people who identify as women. The Morning Star letter says its signatories do not share a particular position regarding the act, but concludes that “whatever your view ... you will agree it is unacceptable for women to be made scared to engage in political life”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7495ad633700c307c5d154531163ae91e4d2abe/0_378_8121_4873/master/8121.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c62ec9e9711e4e9ed14270eed1e3225f","title":"a day in the life of a british beach from fishermen at dawn to midnight kisses","story":"On summer weekends, Ramsgate in Kent is packed with holidaymakers. But as 6am metal detectorists give way to after-school picnickers and exchange students doing the Macarena, there’s more to the seaside than buckets and spades4.26am The light is lifting over Ramsgate harbour. On a bench opposite the Royal pub and nightclub, Katie and Alicia, both 18, are waiting for a cab home. “We come to Ramsgate because this is where the clubs are, here and Canterbury,” says Alicia. Both are still immaculately made up, despite the early hour and the large number of vodkas and coke the night held. “I fell over in the Royal five times!” says Katie she stands up to reveal the muddy seat of her dress. Alicia looks concerned: “Is my makeup still intact?” she wonders. “I’ve been sick a thousand times …”4.41am The sun rises in a curve of fierce orange and a shroud of pinkish light over the water. From the Harbour Arm pier comes the bright sound of gulls, the hum of boats, the smell of salt and bladderwrack seaweed. To our backs, the moon hangs high and pale and round.4.54am A small, white motorboat sets out to sea, moving beyond the buoys. Back on shore, the stalls stand shuttered, the beach empty, the new morning sun reflecting off the windows of the huge, new Wetherspoon’s that opens directly on to the beach. A gentle clunking sound comes from the harbour – a slow-rolling bottle discarded as a man in a grey hoodie sifts through the bins.5.07am Along the arches, everything is still closed: the boat-builders, the harbour office, Thanet Diving \u0026amp Watersports, the Sailors’ Church. A pallet outside R Cannon \u0026amp Sons holds a delivery of white buckets, wrapped in blue plastic. Above, a row of pigeons on a red-brick ledge make soft, nestling sounds.5.14am By the water, blue tubs and troughs sit bundled with ropes and anchors, trays for the catch, lobster cages, netting. The lighthouse light goes out quietly and a bus glides down Royal Parade.5.37am Joe, from nearby Broadstairs, is a crew member for the wind farm, about seven miles off the coast. He enjoys the early-morning shifts. “I love it! It’s the best part of the day!” he says, before he disappears behind the metal gate and along the pontoon. The harbour wall is lined with algae, a joyous, iridescent green.5.50am Outside Cannon’s seafood stall, a car sits with its doors splayed open, a bucket of fish inside. “Half past six, I’ve got to go lobstering!” says Michael Penn. He is busy washing and setting out the bream caught that morning, placing them on the packed ice, next to the prawns and jellied eels.5.54am Anthony, 22, walks past with his dog, Honey. “There’s not that many distractions for her at this time of day,” he says. “And she wakes me up at this time anyway.” Across the street, a man is cleaning the windows of Peter’s Fish Factory – the seafront chippy – using a long pole.6.05am The local Loop bus service has started up. Back outside the Royal, a large truck is collecting the empty bottles. The day is warming and the wind lifting, bringing a briny smell and a golden light across the sands.6.40am On the beach, Martin, 61, has been metal-detecting. “I wish I came out every day, but it’s a couple of times a week,” he says. “It’s a lovely, nice-and-quiet two hours. Someone offered me a cheap metal detector probably 25 years ago – he was hard up, so I bought it. I don’t just do beaches, I’m also in a couple of clubs locally, so I go out at the weekend with them and I record all their finds for the national finds archive – writing them down, weighing and measuring. I’ve found Roman coins, Iron Age coins, medieval stuff. I’ve found bits on the beach I’ve got back to people – jewellery, phones, memory cards …”6.50am Outside Gifts Galore, Derek Rhodes, 72, is putting up flags: Brazil, Wales, a Union Jack. “I’ve had the shop for 20 years,” he says. “It used to be around the corner, but the building started to fall down so I’ve been here for the last five.” He enjoys his days here, right by the beach: “It’s lovely, beautiful friends come every day and have tea – or soup in the winter,” he says. His position opposite Wetherspoon’s has brought a surge in trade. “In November, it was like summertime,” he says. “I’ve never bought so much stock! We’ve sold a lot of England flags lately.”7.28am Two swimmers are out in the waves. One of them – David, 41, a tattooist – emerges slowly from the water and wraps himself in a towel. “I thought I’d be on my own out there,” he says. “My own personal swimming pool! But there’s someone else out there today. I normally go boxing at Golden Gloves, but I do swimming a couple of times a week. It’s beautiful, it’s a good way to clear your head.”8am Down among the boats is Paul, 53, a fisherman. “I’m out at this time most days, taking anglers out on fishing trips. Wait here,” he says, returning with this morning’s daytrippers – including Ian, 50, a carpet-fitter from Rochester, who has headed down here with five friends because they “just fancied a day out fishing”. They are hoping for some skate and will be out for about eight hours. There is a gleam of sun on the green water. “Right! Let’s get fishing!” says Paul. With a heavy clunk of the ropes on the walkway, the boat pulls away softly.8.45am Dawn McIntyre, 55, has just begun her shift, cleaning the showers, toilets and all around the harbour. “They’re generally not too bad,” she says, “because we clean them every day and they have to be immaculate for the mariners who come in. But today … I don’t know if you’ve seen the disabled toilet, but I don’t know what they’ve been doing in there. Holding a foam party, from the looks of things …”8.56am Three men are gathered by the fuel storage of the Thanet Fishermen’s Association, chatting and drinking mugs of tea. Roddy, 59, is delivering fuel – a job he does three or four times a week. “I leave about 4am and pick this up from Essex,” he says of his tanker. “I’ll spend about an hour and a half each time I’m here.” Beside him is Merlin, 49, who runs the fuel company for the commercial vessels. A former fisherman, he took this role when the company began to get busy with the arrival of the wind farm. There are few fishermen out today, he says, “because the weather’s against them. The wind’s a north-easterly we call it a famine wind.” There are days when he misses fishing. “I’ve got to that point where I romanticise it,” he smiles. “I remember the good things.”11.27am Peter’s Fish Factory is bracing itself for the lunchtime rush. Behind the counter, Jamie, 21, is saying how long the queues can run. “In the summer, it’s endless, endless, endless,” he says. Outside, a family of three eat boxes of medium cod and chips, bare-armed and bare-legged – determined, despite the north-easterly, to make the most of the sun.11.45am Michael from Sandwich in Kent is going up in the East Cliff Lift, a listed construction of red brick, with pilasters and architraves and an ornate plaque depicting a dolphin. It carries him up from Harbour Parade to Wellington Crescent. “I’ve never been here before,” he says, as it edges slowly upwards. “I’ve just come for a bit of a stroll. I’ve got nothing else to do.”12.12pm The beach is quiet now. The waves have grown high, bucking against the railings with a soft boom and a flourish of foam.1.14pm At Granville Marina – a parade of houses built partly into chalk cliffs, right by the beach – a couple are cleaning their windows. Jan and John come to their door and explain some of its history: how Ramsgate was the first seaside resort that these houses were once shops for the Granville Hotel on the top. Once, guests would come down Marina Road in their carriages to visit. Their house was home to the coiffeur. “This house has been in the family for 50 years,” says Jan. “It was my aunt’s and she left it to me because I loved it.” They are here semi-permanently now, splitting their time with their home in East Sheen, west London. It is the light they love best. “The sun actually comes up right in front of the window,” says John. “And the light will stay like this till 4pm. And the moon last night was an orange moon.”1.50pm A coachload of Italian schoolchildren arrive for the 2pm tour of the Ramsgate Tunnels – the largest network of civilian wartime tunnels, carved out of the chalk cliffs alongside the beach. Inside, at the cafe counter, two men discuss the merits of the bread pudding.2pm By the ramp to the sands, dressed all in white, is Dave, 77, who moved here last September from Croydon in south London. “People said Ramsgate was beautiful, they said it was out of this world,” he says. “But now it’s just fell to bits. It’s a shame, really. It’s all down to the government. They moved all the rubbish people in and that’s how it’s all deteriorated.”2.06pm At the kiosk on the sands, Jane, 69, and Laura, 19, are selling ice-creams – two Crunchies and a Dream – to three workmen. “We’ve been here about 18 years,” says Jane. “Is that right, Eric?” she calls to her husband, barely visible out the back. “Before that, we were at Dreamland in Margate for 20 years.” Whippy ice-creams are their bestsellers, followed by slush. “We’ve not sold that many today – it’s quiet because of the north-east wind,” she says. Today, they will close about 5pm. Later in the summer, they will stay open as late as 7.30. “It’s not set in stone,” she says. “When the last person comes up for an ice-cream, the shutters come down.”The new Wetherspoon’s along the Parade has changed this stretch of the front. “It doesn’t affect us when it’s sunny, but when it’s cold people who might’ve bought a tea or coffee from us are drawn in there,” she explains. “Quiet times are quieter, is what I’m trying to say. But we get the overflow.”4.25pm From a small cabin on the sands, Tom, a retired firefighter, rents deckchairs and windbreakers and runs a trampoline and a carousel. “I’m here Easter to October and I love it, it’s a great office,” he says. Days like today are not great for business – although it is hot, the wind keeps people away from the shore. “August is the month we make money,” he says. Tom has lived in the area for much of his life. “I was in charge of the fire that burned down all this 20 years ago,” he says, gesturing to the awnings that shield a large stretch of half-begun building work. “It’s the old Pleasurama,” he says. “For the last 15 years, it’s been partially derelict.” He has noticed the demographic changing. “You see a lot of eastern Europeans with a lot of cash to flash around now,” he says. He is looking at buying a place in France. “A watermill outside Limoges, that’s the dream,” he says. “But I’ll need a few good Augusts for that.”4.35pm At a wooden picnic table on the edge of the sand, Emma and Charlotte, both 32, are keeping an eye on their children – they have three each – and catching up on the gossip. They don’t often come down to the beach. “I don’t like the sand – it gets everywhere,” says Emma. “But they love it.” She nods at her children, who are now in the water. “You’d think it would be cheap, but it’s not – I spent £30 on ice-creams, drinks, chips and buckets the other day,” she says.4.52pm Nestling behind a large, striped windbreaker are Annie, 65, Reinhold, 66, Lindsey, 33, Steven, 32, Amy, 10, May, 9, and twins Abby and Katy, 2. They are here as a family, on holiday from Frankfurt. “We love England, we love the beach it’s not too hot and it’s not too cold, there’s a nice breeze and it’s only a seven-hour drive to the ship,” explains Annie, who left Abram in Lancashire for Germany in 1974. When they are not enjoying the beach, they spend their time shopping, “for memorabilia and English things”.5.02pm The sun is still high, but as the day has drawn on and people have finished school and work the beach has grown busier. Pippa, Bethany and Thomas, all 18, and Chloe, 17, are sitting on a step by the sands. They have recently finished their exams and have returned to school today to hand in old textbooks and meet up for a drink. In a few months, they will move away to different cities to start university. “We’re just making the most of the time we have left together, chilling on the beach,” says Pippa.5.35pm A young girl skateboards along the Harbour Arm in shorts and a T-shirt, zig-zagging her way past the fishermen. Meanwhile, in the boot of his car, Potts, 62, lies on a makeshift bed, reading. “I don’t fish, but it’s nice to get out of the house and enjoy life. I chat to everyone – Dutch, Germans, people from all over. I’ll stay and watch the sunset and the people taking pictures.” He pauses and then, unannounced, takes out a didgeridoo and begins playing. “I heard someone playing it once and I liked the sound,” he explains. “One time, when a thick sea mist came down, I started playing and the fishermen over there started wondering what was going on …”7.23pm A gauzy mist has fallen. A man is still fishing off the harbour wall, his daughter crouched at his feet, still in her beachwear, playing Michael Jackson songs on a phone. At this hour, as the light fades, the sky clouds and the fishermen begin to pack up, the gulls’ call sounds more doleful. There are still kite surfers out on the water and children playing on the beach two little girls run across the sand towards the sea line, coats flaring out behind them.7.41pm The day drinkers have moved on now. On the Harbour Parade, the night is revving up. Two bouncers have taken up position outside the Wetherspoon’s at Rokka bar, music spills out on to the pavement.8pm Not far from the harbour sits Lyall, 37, and his dog, Lacey, who live on the streets here. He explains how his other dog, Marley, died three weeks ago. “I used to come down here every Thursday and Friday,” he says. “But when Marley died I was quite depressed.” He has been out of prison for four and a half years, but has struggled to find work and has been homeless for about four months. “There are only about six of us who are actually homeless here,” he says. “The other people are aggressive beggars, heroin addicts, and they bully people.” Yesterday, he was five miles away in Margate. “There’s so many homeless people there sleeping on the beach in tents,” he says. He is on a list for council accommodation, but he does not hold out much hope. “It’s hard with pets,” he says. Not so long ago he was moved along from a spot he had by the waterfall. “Now I sit here because of the cameras, because it’s safe.” Soon, the lighthouse light comes back on, glowing red in the softening night sky.8.40pm Where this afternoon Tom rented deckchairs, a large group of exchange students are now doing the Macarena. When the music fades, Whigfield’s Saturday Night starts up, followed by Lou Bega’s Mambo No 5. Even when the stereo falters, the formation dancing continues. Others play football or leap about on the unattended trampolines. They are here with Churchill House School of English, explains Adwoa Asiedu, 27, one of the group’s activity supervisors. This is a summer job for Asiedu, who is studying for a creative writing MA at Brunel she recently wrote a screenplay called Superstar, “about pursuing your dreams against obstacles”.9.02pm Under the concrete boardwalk are Louise, 20, who works in a nursery, and Matthew, 19, a site supervisor. They are finishing up a barbecue and have spread out a large blanket away from the wind. They look cold, snuggled together in their hoodies. “I was at work and I said let’s go to Aldi and get some bits,” says Louise. “Even though it’s cold, we were like: ‘Let’s brave it! We can take jackets!’”10.03pm The lights have come on in the boats and in the neon of the restaurants along the top of the cliff. Near the harbour office, Philip Louis, 51, a bar manager, is walking home after a night out “pubbing”. Tomorrow, he will take his teenage children to Bruges in Belgium. As he heads off, he points out a fox, pressed against the wall of the Sailors’ Church.11.15pm There is a high, bright moon now. At the Queen’s Head, a cover band is playing Get Lucky. A young couple stands entwined by the shuttered seafood stall, kissing.

I’m extremely relieved and it’s a huge weight off my shoulders going into this year’s Tour, which is going to be the biggest challenge of my career.”As Team Sky faced the Tour de France press corps in rural Vendée, Froome and Sir Dave Brailsford maintained that Froome’s adverse analytical process should never have been made public.“When somebody’s accused of something they haven’t done and that becomes public, then anyone with any sense of fairness would look at that and think that’s challenging,” he said. “But what I look at is a young man who’s had that happen, his worst nightmare, and manage to maintain his dignity, his performance and win the Giro d’Italia in the meantime. To me that’s exceptional.”But Brailsford insisted that Sky would not be releasing any further detail on the ruling and that in fact the onus to share that with the public now lies with Wada and the UCI.“The shadow of doubt shouldn’t exist if we trust in our authorities,” he said. “The people who made the decision were Wada and the UCI, not Team Sky. I think that’s where the information about how that decision was made should come from.”But tensions surrounding Froome remain high. That nervousness was emphasised by the presence of the gendarmerie and his personal bodyguard at Wednesday’s press conference. After Team Sky took security advice from experts at BSkyB during a recent race in France, additional security is now expected to be implemented around Froome once the Tour is under way.Meanwhile the UCI president, David Lappartient, sought to explain further the UCI’s clearing of Froome. “An international federation such as the UCI has to follow the World Anti-Doping Agency,” he said. “They are the experts on this and their experts finally decided that this case was not an anti-doping rule violation so we had to follow the decision from Wada.”Brailsford said he was “absolutely confident since the day this started” that Froome had stayed within the permissible dose.“It was never in doubt for us that this whole thing would get cleared up. But that whole episode is over and Chris deserves a lot of credit for the way he’s handled that whole situation. That gives me a little bit of extra pride that I am part of this team leading into the Tour.”Froome and Sky may be feeling proud but others, including Tom Dumoulin, runner-up to Froome in May’s Giro d’Italia, are less enamoured of the outcome. “I’m not blaming Froome,” Dumoulin said. “He’s been cleared. It’s how the whole case has been handled, which is just a mess. It’s really unfortunate. It’s not what cycling needs.“It’s ruining the reputation of cycling and fans are probably walking away from the sport because of this,” the Dutch rider said, adding: “Nobody deserves to be showered with urine. Froome does not deserve that.”Froome, who had urine thrown at him in 2015 and was taunted by fans dressed in inhaler costumes during May’s Giro, also sought to calm the atmosphere. “If you’re not necessarily a Team Sky fan or a Chris Froome fan, come to the race, put a jersey on of the team you support and support the race in a positive way,” he said. “Don’t bring negativity to the race. That’s my advice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cb5aba00ea6973b8c03209b7d49ef1e08764d58/0_304_4385_2630/master/4385.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f0e06015a980cd7632ce3e149bfe30f","title":"england merlyn india t20 jos buttler","story":"England are expected to fire up the Merlyn spin-bowling machine in the nets at Cardiff on Friday as they search for a method to counter Kuldeep Yadav’s unconventional left-arm wrist spin in their Twenty20 series with India.The message from Jos Buttler, the vice-captain, was not to panic after Tuesday’s opening eight-wicket defeat at Old Trafford, despite a middle-order collapse induced by Kuldeep. The former seamer’s flighted “googlies” claimed five wickets for 24 including Eoin Morgan, Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root in the space of four balls.With such bowlers scarce in England the best option is turn to Merlyn for assistance before Friday’s second game at Sophia Gardens. The technology was introduced in 2005 to replicate Shane Warne before that summer’s Ashes and its inventor, Henry Pryor, claimed it can “bowl any ball known to man”.“Left-arm wrist-spinners seem quite hard to come by,” said Buttler, who top-scored with 69 in Manchester but was Kuldeep’s fifth victim. “One thing we can do is with Merlyn, to replicate the angle. It’s a very good machine to get used to that. But it was the first time some guys have faced Kuldeep and it may take one or two games, plus video.“Old Trafford was one game and it’s Twenty20. We are confident, we will stick to what has served us well, stay true to ourselves and come back hard at them in the next game.”England did not use Merlyn in the build-up to the series and its deployment now would not be viewed as a panacea. The message in the post-match debrief, which took place before the team watched their footballing equivalents the team watched their footballing equivalents win their penalty shoot-out with Colombia, which sparked wild dressing room celebrations, was that batsmen must remain calm and adapt.Buttler, who has faced Kuldeep in the Indian Premier League, said: “He’s a very good bowler. It’s now down to the guys to gain an understanding. You see it a lot in international cricket that guys burst on to the scene and then people get a handle on them.“It’s getting used to the angle as wrist spin is usually right-arm. We know we are a lot better than we showed during that little phase of the game.”India’s victory, sealed by a magnificent unbeaten century from KL Rahul, demonstrated the huge leap in intensity from the six short-form hammerings of Australia, not least given the vocal support for Virat Kohli’s side from the Manchester crowd and the heatwave in the UK that is creating dry surfaces for their spin bowlers.Buttler said: “The pitches will be what they are, so it is down to us to react. We had this in the Champions Trophy last year and in 2013 too. We have to deal with it, counteract that and play in all conditions. That is international cricket.England have confirmed that James Anderson, the leader of their Test attack, will return from a spell spent rehabilitating a chronic shoulder issue in a specially arranged three-day second XI fixture between Lancashire and Nottinghamshire from 15 July.Stuart Broad, another paceman being handled with kid gloves before the Test series with India begins on 1 August, has experienced pain and swelling in his left ankle this summer and visited a specialist on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cc73d49587daa3f225b7ac04bb61f6c8276ba28/0_1270_2683_1610/master/2683.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e84bfb97d6f3e0c7fbcf043c69027043","title":"gambling commission say ladbrokes misled them in black dave case horse racing","story":"The Gambling Commission has said it was misled by Ladbrokes during its investigation into the Black Dave case, which ended on Wednesday with a statement warning bookmakers about their handling of Rule 4 deductions in horse racing. The trainer David Evans was fined last year by racing’s ruling body for delaying notification of a non-runner, Tango Sky, so that he could back his other entrant, Black Dave, before its odds shortened, and he told Ladbrokes of his plan to withdraw Tango Sky at the time of placing his bet.Ladbrokes had maintained it could not be sure, three years after the event, of the reason why it shortened the odds of Tango Sky shortly after Evans’s bet. However, the Commission found proof it did so “in order to maximise Rule 4 deductions” from winning bets already placed, and that Ladbrokes “had failed to appropriately review all information available to them prior to initially providing … inaccurate explanations”.But Ladbrokes escaped punishment because its actions did not amount to a breach of the Commission’s licence conditions or code of conduct and the case pre-dated the Commission’s public statements about the fair application of Rule 4. Ladbrokes was given credit for bringing the case to the attention of racing’s regulator on the day of the race. It is understood the firm saved itself a mere £7.70 by trimming Tango Sky’s price in what was a weak race for turnover.The Commission has now set out the manner in which it expects all firms to apply Rule 4 and officials apparently regard this as a “line in the sand” moment.A Ladbrokes Coral statement said: “Our initial understanding of what had occurred when the price was changed proved to be incorrect, a fact that became apparent when we looked into the specifics.”It added that shortening Tango Sky’s odds was contrary to its trading policy at the time and that it has since emphasised to its traders that markets must be suspended immediately if they receive such information in future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad2d99dfc7836dd19334e0ef242b5e4259997f1/0_27_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75b82b4dcdb67f82cc1999c9d0b5a790","title":"kyle edmund swedish coach klahn world cup rivalry","story":"British No 1 is preparing to face the Californian in the second round before England v Sweden separates them for a dayGood judgment and serendipity threw Kyle Edmund and his Swedish coach, Fredrik Rosengren, together last year in a partnership that has taken him to No 17 in the world and into the second round of Wimbledon on Thursday against Bradley Klahn.Circumstance, however, has dictated that, if Edmund beats Klahn and reaches the third round on Saturday, they will be combining their resources to get into the second week of the tournament just as their respective countries will be walking out alongside each other in Samara for a place in the semi-finals of the World Cup.The player fired the first friendly shot with a tweet: “When your coach is a Swede and you tell him it’s coming home … let’s go @England!”Rosengren, one of the most engaging characters on the Tour, smiled as he replied in kind day afternoon: “It’s already started. We will be friends for a couple more days and then we see … No, we are here to get a good result at Wimbledon.”The banter hit a new height on Tuesday evening after England beat Colombia in a heart-stopping penalty shootout that pitched them into a quarter-final with Sweden, the sort of inevitability nobody saw coming until it was too late.“England is a great team and that is why I believe in Sweden more,” Rosengren said with a smile. “I was cheering for England yesterday, I have to say. It is a good match-up.”They did not watch the game together, as Edmund was elsewhere with friends. Edmund and Rosengren were happy to mug for the cameras in their respective football colours on the practice courts of Aorangi Park, and the coach later elaborated on what has become one of the game’s most successful partnerships. Key to it working is his ability to appreciate that Edmund needs space and time away from the grind of his day job.“It’s always good to have things to do to relax and to enjoy the ride. You can’t speak tennis 24 hours a day or think about tennis 24 hours a day. He has to relax between matches. He has to be switched on when he is working and we are talking. But he is a young guy and he deserves to have fun also.”He might have some fun against Klahn, a 27-year-old Californian left-hander ranked 168 in the world, or he might struggle if he is not focused. There was a time when he would let his game wander after a good start and end up losing matches he should have won. In recent months, however, that has not been so much a problem for him. Since he reached the semi-finals at the Australian Open this year, Edmund has had a distinct edge about him.He should have beaten Fabio Fognini in a tough match on the clay of Roland Garros but he attracted the attention of former world No 1, John McEnroe there, who declared he was good enough to win a major and was looking increasingly like a top-10 player.Rosengren said part of Edmund’s problem in the past was that he was sometimes too intense – and Jamie Murray is among players who know him well to observe that he often red-lines in a match when he might profit from relaxing more.Nobody who has met Edmund would accuse him of that. What he is developing, however, is a bit of attitude. He will need it to go deep in a tournament where he has struggled in the past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd5d78bb7bee304a02ebd321cb489e6e62ea9a08/238_414_3200_1919/master/3200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70b45dcf00ed07aec509b9bae0b2a050","title":"lewis hamilton faith perspective f1","story":"Lewis Hamilton knows that risk is part of his business but has revealed that while his passion for Formula One is as strong as ever, he believes it is not worth dying for. As he prepares for this weekend’s British Grand Prix, the four-time world champion also emphasised the importance of his faith and despite the danger inherent in the sport, that: “God has his hand over me”.Hamilton is now in his 12th season in F1 and is expected shortly to confirm an extension to his contract with Mercedes for a further two years. He made his debut in 2007, when he was 22 years old, and took his first title in 2008 for McLaren, scoring three more with Mercedes in 2014, 2015 and 2017. Now one of the most experienced and successful drivers on the grid, he insists his enthusiasm is undiminished but tempered as part of a broader perspective on life.“I love racing,” he said in a podcast released on Wednesday. “I wouldn’t say F1 is worth dying for. Your dream, passion, ambition and goals can be worth dying for.”Hamilton had been greatly moved by a fan who told him she had cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy during his debut season and that his performances inspired her recovery.“It is hard to grasp that and to imagine what she is going through but she grabbed on to something,” he said. “That was maybe this young kid coming from nowhere but facing adversity, somehow fighting through it. That’s definitely worth fighting for, that’s definitely worth dying for, if you can touch one kid and put them on course for their potential.”Hamilton goes into the race at Silverstone, the third leg of F1’s first triple header after France and Austria, after a frustrating meeting at the Red Bull Ring. The Mercedes driver was forced to retire there and his 14-point lead in the world championship became a one-point deficit to Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel.The 33-year-old has always been open about his Christian faith and believes it plays a major role in his life and his racing. At the Nurburgring in 2007 during qualifying, a wheel nut that had not been located correctly caused his tyre to blow under heavy loading into turn eight at 160mph and his car to spear nose-first into the barrier. It illustrated the danger he knows is a constant companion in F1.“You don’t have time to pray,” he said of such incidents. “Anything can happen any day, but I feel God has his hand over me.” It is a belief strengthened by regular prayer and attendance at church. “I go with a couple of my close friends,” he said. “We meet, we go for breakfast and then we go to church together. We leave most often feeling enlightened and empowered, it’s like a re-centring.”Hamilton has matured as a driver and is at the peak of his powers, which are being put to the test for the second season in a row in a close title fight with Vettel, also a four-time world champion. The pair have exchanged the championship lead five times this year in nine races and intriguingly, drawing on Star Wars, Hamilton believes he is better able to deal with the battle mentally than ever.“My attitude to risk, in a sense it is more controlled, more calculated risk,” he said. “Whereas when I was a kid it was just pure adrenaline and pure balls. I have still got that, but I have also got the mental side. I am stronger in my mind than ever. It is almost like you can relate it to the movie with the force. He has the force within him but doesn’t know how to utilise it. I have the force within me but now I can control it.”That reaching this point has not been easy is well documented but Hamilton was also honest about how much opposition he faced, even as a child. “Parents of other drivers would say: ’You’re not good enough’. Grown adults telling an eight-year-old: ’You just don’t have it.’ It knocked me back,” he said. “I struggled at school, I was dyslexic and I was always behind because I was racing. My headmaster was a complete arsehole. He didn’t agree to me taking time off to race and would put me in detention for the day. I hated school.”Hamilton goes to the British Grand Prix as strong favourite, with the chance to surpass Jim Clark and Alain Prost with his sixth win at the race but is taking nothing for granted. With team errors costing him at three races this season, he sees the travails he has suffered as part of the sport.“Formula One has given me a life, given me a purpose, which is pretty special. But F1 has also broken me. It’s broken me and built me, broken me and built me,” he said. “When you go through it, you put so much into it, it breaks your heart and kills you when you fail, when you stumble, when everyone’s watching when you stumble. But, when you get back up and when you succeed it lifts you up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f6083b8691cc769ddebb58d1b7aa2624d45a22/0_221_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=223a103eadbaeee74e615d2eb704097c","title":"rory mcilroy irish open majors","story":"• Last of McIlroy’s four major triumphs came in 2014• ‘I need to get back to playing the game like I was a teenager’Rory McIlroy has vowed to summon the spirit of his youth as he seeks a return to winning ways at major championships.The US PGA Championship of 2014 marks the last of McIlroy’s four major triumphs. This year has seen a Masters tilt undermined by a poor final round, with McIlroy subsequently missing the cut at the US Open. His final competitive appearance before the Open, which takes place at Carnoustie, is in this week’s Irish Open at sun-drenched Ballyliffin McIlroy’s charity foundation once again hosts the event.“I think as you get older, it’s natural instinct to become a little more careful,” McIlroy said. “You take way more risks when you’re a teenager than you do in your 20s, than you would do in your 30s and it’s only natural to be that way, not just in golf but life in general. I just need to get back to playing the game like I was a teenager.”McIlroy links matters of the mind – rather than anything technical – to his closing round at Augusta National as his playing partner, Patrick Reed, prevailed. Therein lies an Open lesson. “Not be careful, not try to be too perfect,” McIlroy added. “Not try to control things that you can’t control. Just go out and play your game. You know, get out of your own way, I guess.“That’s the one thing that I need to do better and it’s more a mental thing rather than anything physical or anything. I just have to approach it better mentally.“I think you always have to be willing to fail in order to succeed. I think the way I’ve approached the game at some times this year, I’ve been sort of too careful. I haven’t been willing to hit the right shot or hit driver when I need to be aggressive.”In keeping with an obvious plan not to become mentally constrained, McIlroy pointed to a broader picture beyond professional aspirations.“Look, if I didn’t win another major for the rest of my career, nothing is going to change in my life whether I win one or not,” McIlroy said. “But obviously I wouldn’t feel like I’ll have fulfilled my potential. At the same time, there’s other things in my life that are more important than golf. I’d be disappointed but again, it’s not going to change things. I don’t panic. It doesn’t keep me up at night.“I’ve got two more chances this year to hopefully play myself into contention. That was my goal. My goal this year, it wasn’t to win majors. It was just to give myself a chance and to put myself in positions to see how I fare.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6df45dfde36806a97da5ecba45b49c6d8785879/0_17_5194_3117/master/5194.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3538abed549177c0f5e9749ad0bc750e","title":"the lieutenant of inishmore review aidan turner martin mcdonagh","story":"Noël Coward theatre, LondonThe Poldark star gives an excellent performance in a first-rate revival of Martin McDonagh’s brutally funny playPoldark fans turning up to see Aidan Turner in Martin McDonagh’s bilious, blood-strewn comedy may be in for a surprise. Instead of a liberal Cornish mine-owner, Turner plays – and very well, too – an Irish freedom fighter, Padraic, who is deemed too mad for the IRA. What is fascinating is seeing how a play, written in 1994 but not premiered until 2001, makes a subtly different impact today. I vividly recall the outrage the play originally caused. I remember an Irish critic fuming at what he saw as a slur on his nation and I had cat-loving friends who were equally incensed. Both parties were offended by a plot in which “mad Padraic”, a violent member of a republican splinter group, returns to his native Inishmore to find that his beloved cat, Wee Thomas, is deader than any doornail. Not fooled by desperate attempts to cover an orange cat with shoe polish to disguise Wee Thomas’s demise, Padraic vows revenge on his dad, Donny, and on the moggie’s assumed killer, Davey. But the plot thickens and the blood flows as Padraic is assailed by murderous gunmen and rescued only by Davey’s wild sister. This is comedy at its blackest. But a play that was hair-raisingly risky to stage in 2001, when bombing of the UK mainland was still current and the peace process was a pipe dream, now seems strangely prescient. It is obviously about Ireland, but its portrait of the sentimentality and sanctimonious rhetoric that often lies behind terrorist violence has acquired new resonance. McDonagh especially skewers the puritanism that is part of purblind devotion to a cause. When Padraic tortures a drug pusher who corrupts Catholic kids or declares, “I’m interested in no social activities that don’t involve the freeing of Ulster”, we might be listening to any form of religious fanaticism. McDonagh’s real gift, however, is for pushing a situation to its most brutal extreme, and being funny with it. This is Titus Andronicus played for laughs. Sometimes, the jokes are barely remarked, as when Davey, speaking of the local cats, says: “They’re all full of themselves.” Other times they are more visible. When Padraic vows not to marry Davey’s sister until Ireland is free, his father concludes: “That’ll be a long fecking engagement!” Far from being frivolous, however, the humour is all part of McDonagh’s ethical assault on the politics of revenge. This comes across clearly in Michael Grandage’s comically horrific production, set in a stone-walled cottage designed by Christopher Oram, where blood sprays the window panes as in a splatter movie. Turner is excellent as Padraic, and plays him not as some wild-eyed barbarian but as a man endowed with a demented innocence. When he tortures the pusher, he appears solicitous for his welfare. In other moments he seems unable to relate cause and effect. Addressing a colleague, one of whose eyes he shot with a crossbow, he remarks: “You never let bygones be bygones, you.” My abiding image, however, is of Turner caressing his dead cat with a tendresse he never displays to humans. Charlie Murphy as the girl for whom he finally falls, Chris Walley as her hapless brother and Denis Conway as Padraic’s dad all give good support. Although I could have done without an interval, this strikes me as a first-rate revival of a play that still instructively shocks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af4b382e9bbe9af38a2d1624c2e84d92a37ce611/0_46_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae844571c8e1923abbaef9edc6433c7b","title":"share your favourite family barbecue pics and win with birra moretti","story":"Celebrate the quintessential British summer tradition with Birra Moretti and you could win a countertop draught beer system for your home, plus a £250 Red Letter Days voucherWhat is it about summer that makes it so fantastic to cook in the great outdoors?

The route is well-signposted and uses a mix of dedicated cycle paths and minor roads. It works its way along the river and the scenery is stunning. The route is flat but there are worthwhile ersions inland – involving moderate hills – to visit chateaux. There is plenty of good accommodation (B\u0026ampBs, small hotels) along the route: we pre-booked it all online. Nantes is a great place to finish as it has Les Machines de L’Île and the amazing giant mechanical elephant. We covered about 400km over two weeks.  Andrew SpencerThis is a wonderful 440km cycle ride through peaceful countryside and the beautiful walled medieval towns of Nördlingen and Rothenburg ob der Tauber. The route also passes through the larger town of Augsburg. Towards the end of the ride, with the Alps in the distance, there is the amazing scene of Neuschwanstein castle in its mountain. The Europabus coach service offers transport for cyclists and their bikes (reservations advisable), as well as offering short packages for cycling tours. It is, however, easy to organise yourself, as most German train stations have bike hire places, and it is easy to get to the start and from the finish by train. Jennie ParsonsGet the ferry to the Hook of Holland or Rotterdam and pick up the Eurovelo 2 cycle trail, also called the Capitals Route. It takes you across the Netherlands and Germany to Berlin (then on to Moscow if you wish). The route is so well-signposted that you rarely have to look at the map (except to find a campsite or hostel, which are handily marked on the route book, which can be ordered from the website for a donation), and it feels a bit like a treasure hunt looking out for the next signpost. You are taken along small, well-paved paths through forests and rambling countryside, with delicious food and beer and friendly people along the way. It’s long enough to be a real challenge (it took me two weeks) but also flat and smooth enough to not feel overwhelming. Rj HahnThe beauty of cycle touring is that you see amazing things while you are in motion. Watching a landscape shift as you pedal round it is a fantastic feeling, and occasionally you stumble upon a path that makes your heart thump. For me, that was the D25 road from Gospić to Karlobag, in Croatia. It takes you from the leafy interior along 24km of gradual climbing up through a mountain pass. Yes, it is gruelling but, if you stick to bottom gear, put your head down and ride it out, you will be rewarded.After a few hours of solid uphill, the enclosed pass suddenly opens out and you enjoy a calf stretch as you free wheel through the village of Baške Oštarije. You are at the top of the mountain ridge. The road goes into a tunnel and on the other side is an entirely new world. I could see a dozen rocky islands in the glistening Adriatic Sea – the first sea I had seen for 60 days of cycling. To see so far and so unexpectedly, I thought I had jumped into Google Earth.The remainder of the journey was a 1,000-metre descent, full of hairpin bends you only see on car adverts. The main danger was keeping an eye on the road while such an incredible view was in front of me. This journey kept me buzzing for days and is the best afternoon of cycling I have ever had.  Alexander Lewis-JonesOur family cycling holiday around the Amalfi coast was a great way to enjoy the amazing scenery and gave us the flexibility to stop and see loads of beautiful spots both on the coast and in the hills and forests. In fact, most tourists were stuck in cars in traffic jams as we rode past them. For €30 a day we rented excellent bikes from cyclingamalfi – they have a choice of trekkers or e-bikes including locks, helmets, kits and panniers and give advice on routes, too. funinfinlandAt the age of 50, I realised my dream of completing a leg of the famous Giro d’Italia cycle race last spring when I biked from Milan to Sanremo. I hired a bike from Bici Rossignoli in Milan. The 200-mile trip did take me four days at 70 miles a day, stopping off at excellent youth hostels in Genoa then in Finale Ligure on the coast. Coming back, I took advantage of Trenitalia’s take your bike onboard service  from €3.50 a day.  TheCapeCruiser It may not be a long distance for some but the 127 miles from Dieppe to Paris provide a beautiful few days’ cycling. The most famous route is the Avenue Verte, but the best route has been pioneered by Donald Hirsch .The early miles of the route meander through little French villages, over rolling downs and past fields of wheat and corn. The roads are quiet, and there are just enough hills to keep it interesting but not exhausting. Donald’s website contains links to cycle-friendly accommodation.As you near Paris, unlike the Avenue Verte, this route takes you through a series of royal hunting forests to avoid the traffic. After 120 miles of villages, fields, and hunting forests, you enter Parc St Cloud. It’s an area of woodland just after Versailles, traffic-free, long and straight, and bordered by tall trees. Then, you see that the road opens out to a paved area, fountains, and something beyond.Donald’s route takes you to the left, so you never see what’s at the end of the road. But it’s worth cycling on to investigate. You find yourself on a cliff, with all of Paris stretched out in front of you. It will leave you breathless from the view, not the exertion. FrancesValdesIf you’re looking for an introduction to cycle touring (or your partner isn’t as keen as you) the 100-mile Baie de Somme route is the perfect way to explore this underrated region. The cycling is easy throughout and a self-guided route with Belle France (£895pp half-board) is easy to follow with comprehensive maps and notes. We took our own bikes, though bike hire (or even e-bikes) can be included.

He has fired TV missivesmissiles from over there before\u0026nbsp– about his native south, native Americans on the big screen and country music. This time, he is taking on the big one: he is Sigmund Freud in a\u0026nbspcowboy hat, and is analysing the American\u0026nbspdream.There doesn’t seem to be much of it\u0026nbsp– the dream\u0026nbsp– around Lancaster, Ohio, today. It is, says Rich, “the kind of town that even Springsteen wouldn’t write a\u0026nbspsong about. It’s that grim.” Very little chance of making a\u0026nbspdecent wage here of having the chance to work with\u0026nbspdignity.What does the American dream even mean? The idea has been embedded in the US’s creation myth since the pilgrims arrived at Plymouth Rock, but the original hard-work ethic\u0026nbsp– and the very definition of success itself\u0026nbsp– has mutated over the years from something spiritual to something material to who-knows-what? Still, it’s the concrete that unifies Americans, even if that concrete looks seriously crumbly in\u0026nbspLancaster.To Plymouth first, though, where it all began, and where Hall’s dream chasing starts, too. No, “chase” sounds too fast. He may cover the first couple of centuries\u0026nbsp– from the Puritans and Calvinists whose character and fate were determined by their labours, or so they thought, to the beginning of industrialisation\u0026nbsp– quite speedily. But then he begins to meander, and I\u0026nbspmean that in the best possible\u0026nbspway.He strays across the Mason-Dixon Line, finds out what the American dream meant for cotton pickers, and mill workers, wage slaves and no-wage slaves. He takes in Grant Wood’s American Gothic recreates it, in fact, with his own pitchfork, though he can’t re-create the humourless blank look in the couple’s eyes\u0026nbsp– I\u0026nbspdon’t think Rich is desperate to get back to work in the fields, or loading pig\u0026nbspiron.The Great Depression, erosion of workers’ rights, Taylorism, false promise, the decline of Detroit\u0026nbsp… often the American dream looks more like a\u0026nbspnightmare. It’s not easy to take pride in your work when you don’t have a\u0026nbspjob.The story is littered with bad dreams, lumpy mattresses and lumpy metaphors. And, again, I\u0026nbspmean that in a\u0026nbspgood way. “As America expanded, more and more Europeans followed, trailing in the celestial prop wash of the floating female godhead of fortune,” he says. I\u0026nbspthink he’s talking about the boats they arrived on, and John Gast’s painting American Progress, in which a\u0026nbspgiant ethereal female spirit strides west, stringing telegraph wire as she goes. Whatever, I\u0026nbsplike it (Rich Hall’s proclamation less so the\u0026nbsppicture).As well as art, he wanders into literature (“in a\u0026nbspway, we’re all not-so-great Gatsbys”), architecture, Frank Lloyd Wright, the arts and craft movement, how modernism finally got to question the American dream\u0026nbsp– and movies and\u0026nbsptelevision.And he gets waylaid, mainly by his own laconic wit, but also by the need to ulge some not entirely important, but nevertheless fascinating, trivia\u0026nbsp– such as the fact that many of the now extremely valuable original mission-style oak rocking chairs designed by Gustav Stickley are owned by Barbra Streisand. Or to have a\u0026nbspdig at something\u0026nbsp– Kasabian (justifiably), Butlin’s (less so, I\u0026nbspthink), familiar reference points for us Britons who have never heard of\u0026nbspStickley.He also\u0026nbsp– justifiably\u0026nbsp– lays into self-improvement nonsense, personal growth and positive thinking, and the massive industry surrounding it. Is that what has become of the American dream? Or is it all on social media, where you can create your own fantasy of what it means to be American, without working at all? The American dream: fake\u0026nbspnews.The title\u0026nbsp– Barry Davies: The Man, the Voice, the Legend (BBC One)\u0026nbsp– says it all, really. (To be read in his voice, though of course he would be far too modest to.) Oh, I\u0026nbspsay, what a\u0026nbspman, what a\u0026nbspvoice, what a\u0026nbsplegend!Even John Motson (a teeny bit begrudgingly?) has to agree. Motty\u0026nbsp– plus many other famous faces\u0026nbsp– takes part in this warm tribute on the eve of his great rival’s\u0026nbspretirement.My favourite bit is Barry’s son Mark remembering going along with his father for his first FA Cup final commentary at Wembley. Imagine it, sitting next to your dad, at work, as he talks the nation through the cup final. Now that’s how to gain filial\u0026nbsprespect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a5c18d5baa104de8436c5525f20e7d18ed9d113/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d61c515ee197be93db5a81f38bce994","title":"driving profits how the car cam became comedys favourite vehicle","story":"From James Corden and Peter Kay to Jerry Seinfeld, comedians are using the cheap and simple device to make lucrative TVJerry Seinfeld’s formula for Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, which returns to Netflix this week, is beautifully simple. Load up a car with GoPro cameras, drive one of your pals around, go and get a drink, repeat. Not every episode is a success – in the case of Christoph Waltz’s episode, it may actively stink – but it’s only 15 minutes long. Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee is rickety and disposable and it will probably end up being one of the definitive shows of the age.That’s because Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee is one of a clutch of beloved car-cam shows. Peter Kay’s final Car Share special in May was so breathlessly anticipated that the whole thing barely even bothered with a story. When James Corden unveiled a Carpool Karaoke segment that he shot with Paul McCartney last month, people were effusive to the point of hysteria. On paper, it sounded dreadful – Corden bellowing over a selection of beloved songs while McCartney told a procession of well-honed anecdotes – but people reacted with joy.A lot of this has to do with the setting. Cars are private spaces. They are small and intimate. They also require great concentration on the part of the driver, which adds a slightly distracted tenor to any conversations that happen within. This offhand nature allows people to open up in ways they would not in a more traditional setting.To return to the McCartney Carpool Karaoke for a moment, try to imagine how unbearable it would have been if it had taken place within a traditional talkshow arena. Imagine James Corden, microphone in hand, witlessly duetting McCartney’s new single between rehearsed reminiscences about life in Liverpool in front of a fawning studio audience. It would have been woeful. It would have been Alan Partridge. Being in a car helped to humanise the pair of them.Not that this is a particularly new phenomenon, of course. Television producers have been putting cameras in cars for decades, ever since the mid-90s, when the BBC created one of the world’s first reality stars in Driving School’s quivering, incompetent Maureen Rees. Carpool Karaoke can probably be traced back to a clip of Peter Kay and Paddy McGuinness belting out the Minder theme tune in a van at the turn of the century, while Car Share owes a very clear debt to Rob Brydon’s 2000 series Marion and Geoff.As for Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, that’s a little more contentious. Its premise is so deceptively simple that people are lining up to take credit for it. Robert Llewellyn’s Carpool preceded Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee by three years and has such a similar premise – the host has a conversation with a celebrity in a car – that it reportedly caused Llewellyn’s agent to look at their legal options. Meanwhile, more recently, the director of the Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee pilot is now claiming that the idea is his and is filing a lawsuit of his own.The latter case is particularly interesting, because it has blown apart one of the biggest myths of car-cam programming. To look at one of these shows – with weird sound, jerky cameras and no sense of any kind of production value – you would think that they were done on the cheap. In fact, the opposite is true. Apple bought a Carpool Karaoke series from Corden and made it a cornerstone of its billion-dollar original content strategy. Car Share caused the revenue of Peter Kay’s production company to spike by millions of pounds. As for Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee – and this has been cited as the cause of the most recent lawsuit – Seinfeld will take home $750,000 for every 15-minute episode he makes for Netflix.In terms of equipment, these shows may not be that expensive to make. But the cost of the talent involved is eye-watering. Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee may be a passable way to spend a quarter of an hour, but when you think of the other, better shows that could be made with its budget, it seems like a tremendous waste. Enjoy you car-cam shows while you can, because the bubble can’t be far from bursting.Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee season six starts on Netflix on 6 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74449c5b72972d5fedfa528728fdc0cc08ea7a00/0_244_5472_3284/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d32e8a0c95b45055f4d746dd6bba3cae","title":"fourth of july alternative celebrations","story":"Alternative things to do if you’re not a fan of hotdogs, fireworks or immigration policyThis year in particular if feels as though there’s not that much to celebrate. Our trollish president has spent his first two long-feeling years in office alienating our allies and was just caught trying to goad Nato countries into paying him protection money like some kind of mob boss. On top of it all, Koko the gorilla, our greatest national treasure, is now dead. It’s enough to make you reassess the totality of our nation’s history and only think about the bad parts – of which there are many – and reach the perfectly reasonable conclusion that our country is not worth celebrating at all and never has been.This leaves us with quite the quandary: what’s a young person to do on America’s birthday when America itself isn’t much of a priority?If you have the Fourth of July off, you might as well put your free time to good use. For some people, that could mean dedicating the day to something bigger than themselves. Others may want to go about their Fourth in a more-or-less normal way while tweaking the particulars to subvert the holiday’s patriotism. Or perhaps you just want to slack off and have a slight reprieve from life in America for just one day. Here are some suggestions – some specific, some more general – as to how to accomplish all that.It’s hot on the Fourth of July, and you know what melts in the heat? Ice. And, if you happen to be in Philly, you’ve also got a chance to help melt Ice, aka Immigration and Customs Enforcement, whose Philadelphia branch is one of the most active – and actively protested – in the country. Head to Ortlieb’s in Philadelphia for a night of dancing to the smooth sounds of the local house DJ Steve J while donating to Juntos, a local Latinx immigrants’ rights group dedicated to resisting Ice from every angle.The greatest secret in all of sports is that minor league baseball games are way more fun than major league games. The tickets are cheap, the players are passionate, and all the teams have weird names like the New Orleans Baby Cakes and the Batavia Muckdogs. You can look up your local team here. Here’s hoping your club is wearing their special Jar Jar Binks jerseys or throwing a George Costanza Appreciation Night.Speaking of the short, stocky bald man, you and some friends could always try to recreate the classic Seinfeld episode The Summer of George and hit your city’s disc golf (or, as George calls it, “frolf”) course. For bonus points, bring along a cooler full of the Summer of George cocktail, a variation of the mai tai that incorporates St George liqueur. (Also, if you do this, please drink lots of water, as it will be very hot out and mai tais are known to be dehydrating.)If you hadn’t heard, weed is legal in Colorado, which means that businesses can take any ostensibly boring activity, introduce marijuana into the equation, and – presto! – have a goofily fun event for the masses. That’s the idea behind CannaBingo at Colorado Springs’ Studio A64, a bar-like “cannabis club” where alcohol is switched out for the sticky icky stuff, and bingo transforms from a yawner of a game into a Sisyphean gauntlet of giggle-filled confusion. If the Fourth of July is a day where you can pretend to be retired for 24 hours, you might as well smoke some ganja and do retired-people stuff.You might have the day off, but you know who doesn’t? The millions of very good dogs and cats stuck in America’s animal shelters waiting to be adopted. Literally all of them would very much like to hang out with you on this wonderful Fourth of July. Even if you can’t adopt or foster one yourself, you can head to an adoption center near you and spend the day helping to socialize the animals so they can learn how to become the furry friends in a forever-home that they were meant to be.It’s totally understandable that, despite how much of a dumpster fire you feel America is at the moment, you might want to do the standard-issue Fourth of July stuff for reasons that have nothing at all to do with America itself. In which case, perhaps consider hosting a barbecue serving co-op-purchased food (find a co-op near you by clicking here) while slamming beers from employee-owned breweries and blasting this playlist of anti-capitalist jams.

Pompeo, on his third visit to the North Korean capital, is expected to press Kim on a recent report suggesting that far from beginning the process of denuclearisation, North Korea was making “rapid upgrades” to its Yongbyon nuclear complex.Unnamed US intelligence officials also concluded that North Korea does not intend to completely give up its nuclear stockpile.Pompeo will also use his visit to consult and reassure Washington’s allies in the region, with meetings planned with Japanese and South Korean officials in Tokyo on Sunday. Japan has voiced support for the leaders’ Singapore declaration, but reacted cautiously to Trump’s decision to cancel a joint US-South Korea military exercise scheduled for August.At present, the US has no reliable information on where all of North Korea’s production and testing facilities are located or the size of its ballistic inventory.In a tweet this week, Trump said Washington and Pyongyang had been having “many good conversations” with North Korea over denuclearisation. “In the meantime, no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months, he said. “All of Asia is thrilled. Only the Opposition Party, which includes the Fake News, is complaining. If not for me, we would now be at War with North Korea!”Sceptics have pointed out that Kim no longer believes such tests are necessary now that the North has successful developed an intercontinental ballistic missile, and that dismantling North Korea’s missile and nuclear infrastructure represents a much tougher diplomatic challenge that could take years and cost billions of dollars, if it happens at all.“Denuclearisation is no simple task,” Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, wrote in a commentary. “There is no precedent for a country that has openly tested nuclear weapons and developed a nuclear arsenal and infrastructure as substantial as the one in North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.”Experts have played down Trump’s upbeat appraisal of his 12 June meeting with Kim in Singapore, where the leaders made a loose commitment to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and agreed goodwill measures such as the possible return of the remains of US soldiers from the 1950-53 Korean war.There are signs Pompeo might abandon all-or-nothing demands for CVID and replace them with incremental steps that South Korea has reportedly suggested would be more likely to secure Kim’s cooperation.Washington has also come to accept that securing Chinese and Russian cooperation would be easier if it backed away from CVID in early talks with North Korea.“The choice was either bend it or break it,” a US official told Reuters. Patrick Cronin of the Center for a New American Security said. “The US may be exploring the degree to which he will dismantle major programs within the coming months, and if dropping some language to do this is required, Washington seems willing to do that at this point.”It remains to be seen if Pompeo will present Kim with a timeline for denuclearisation. National security adviser John Bolton’s claim that North Korea could complete that goal in the space of a year was met with widespread scepticism, even by administration officials.Earlier this week, state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert declined to give a timeframe for North Korea’s denuclearisation, saying “I know some iniduals have given timelines we’re not going to provide a timeline for that. A lot of work is left to be done, certainly. We go into this eyes wide open.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7c28f8847567d70458ea4286ef554edc783ed76/0_0_4675_2631/master/4675.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026q=55\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=\u0026s=cfb484300f6a77fe6288bcdb5ffaa555","title":"london clubs and racism the west end is a hostile environment","story":"It is midnight on a warm midsummer’s night in Mayfair, central London. Across wide lanes of traffic – ceaseless, even at this hour – I can just about make out the dark silhouette of Hyde Park’s trees. But it is a dozen plastic-wrapped parking tickets, slapped on a primary-coloured Lamborghini beside me, that I can hear flapping in the breeze.I am at the Hilton Park Lane hotel, the super-rich heart of the super-rich centre of London. The sports cars are not only symbols of extreme wealth, but of the attitudes that accompany it, that allow the car-owners to treat parking fines as if they were an upmarket meter system.Tonight, the latter is prophetic. The velvet rope separating the “abnoxious” from the rest of us is struggling to contain a show-stoppingly beautiful black woman, who is shouting at the door staff.“They know me. They invited me down here. And now they don’t want to let me in because of my colour,” she yells. “Don’t deny the fact that black people are poppin’. You play our music. Do I need to say any more?”When I talk to the 24-year-old, she explains why she is so furious at being denied entry. “I’ve been standing in the line and seeing bare white people going in before me,” she says. “Personally, I think this is a colour thing. Black people are not allowed in central London, I swear to you. The way Mayfair works for me, you’ve got to look like a certain something – you have got to be white, tall, really slim.”She describes herself as an “influencer” and says she does not want to be named because she fears the consequences to her profile. But, she continues: “I’m a party girl, I go out all the time. And as black women, we are always being disrespected – we can’t go out there and have a good time, without them reminding us about our colour.”In this sentiment she is not alone. Last month, another young black woman, out clubbing to celebrate the end of her exams, alleged that she was charged twice as much for entry to Drama as white girls in the queue. The club denied that this was the case, saying that both white and black members of the group were charged £20 for entry.“We do not tolerate any form of discrimination against any inidual or group,” the club said in a statement. “The standard door charge at Drama Park Lane is £20. Promotions are offered for various reasons, but never on the grounds of discrimination of race, colour or national origin.” The club is now investigating both the allegations.But on social media, the young woman’s mother, TV producer Nadine Marsh-Edwards, said: “My daughter went to a club in the West End last night. Black girls got charged £20 entrance fee – white girls £10 … London life right now. They need to be reminded it’s London 2018 not Mississippi 1962.”The club contacted Marsh-Edwards, although her comments have led to further allegations, many citing almost identical experiences, throwing a spotlight on reviews of Mayfair clubs on TripAdvisor, where allegations of racism are common, stretching back several years.On the night I went clubbing in Mayfair I saw this flexible door policy at first hand. Drama’s £20 entry fee was quickly waved away when I made a vague excuse, leaving me the impression that it is considered small change when compared to the takings inside.Until about a decade ago, I was no stranger to the Mayfair and central-London club scene. Devotees of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB, my friends and I knew the DJ schedule at most of the clubs by heart, and would go wherever they were playing our favourite music. On a good day, we could blag our way in for free, but most of the time, we paid £10 or £20. But, as a black girl, you always felt your game had to be tight. Those of mixed race, like me, had an easier time than our friends with darker complexions who seemed to be judged more critically by doorstaff. The threat of exclusion was always lurking just under the surface.But, descending beneath the Lamborghini-lined entrance to Drama, those days seem like a more innocent time. The first thing that struck me was the prevalence of cosmetic surgery. Next, that this was a club devoted not to dancing, but to “tables” – booths topped with grey ice buckets for super-sized, frosted bottles of spirits that cost those enjoying them up to £1,000. The dancefloor is an afterthought – a few square metres of space we had to share with a disproportionate number of security guards and a couple of women in thongs, who occassionally burst into unprovoked episodes of twerking. Champagne, the drink of choice at the bar, was an eye-watering £17 a glass.About a quarter of the club’s floor space was shut off altogether – an unoccupied and unlit VIP area. It felt like a metaphor for the whole experience of going to a club that is always aspiring to a wealthier, more important and famous clientele.During the period I was in the club, out of about 150 clubbers, I saw just one group of five bored-looking black boys, slumped around a table, and one black woman in a large table-less group of white friends. Among the staff, we observed just one black man.When we moved on to nearby Scandal, a larger club closer to the heart of the West End, there were more people dancing. There were also slightly more people from minority ethnic groups and a black DJ. But with the exception of one dancer among the half-dozen or so women performing provocative moves in little cubby holes built into the walls, I could see no black women at all. The club declined to comment.It is black women, critics say, who are the net losers in the current Mayfair club game. Fashion blogger Fisayo Longe recently described her experience at Libertine, writing that she was denied entry and was told it was: “Maybe because you’re black,” and “… probably because you’re not good looking enough”. The nightclub has denied this, saying the records from their ID scanner prove they have a varied demographic. “We can categorically state that we do not have a door policy that is based on the colour of people’s skin.”In 2015, the nightclub DSTRKT refused entry to a group of black women who say they were told they were “too dark” and “overweight”. The nightclub denied this and says the club was full. The same year, Cirque le Soir rejected a group of New Orleans Saints NFL players, despite the fact that they had reservations. The players reported being told it was because they were “six big guys” (none was over 6ft) and “too urban”. The nightclub denied this, saying the men were refused entry because they were in an all-male group.TripAdvisor reviews of the past few years report clubs including Libertine, Drama and Cirque le Soir splitting up mixed groups of friends, with only the white members allowed in. “Eww, your kind isn’t allowed in here,” one girl reports a staff member telling her and an Asian friend. Other reviews of some Mayfair clubs dating back to January 2017 include the headlines “undercover Nazis” and “Racist Club! No black people allowed!” But in a society where British people of colour face discrimination at work, racist abuse on the streets and even deportation, do unpleasant experiences at a handful of nightclubs really matter?Marsh-Edwards thinks so. “This is the start of a young person’s life out in the world, and these sort of micro-aggressions tell you a lot about how you are seen by society,” she says. “Some of these girls are going to end up running companies, they are going to go into that boardroom one day, probably as the only woman and highly likely the only black person. And they have already been told they are not worthy, and not on a level playing field.”In a world where discretion is seen as a core asset, it was difficult to find anyone who works in the Mayfair club scene who would allow their name to be used for this article. One promoter, who is black, says he witnessed overt racial discrimination over more than a decade working in Mayfair and the West End. “I can go into any club with 10 hot, blond models and be given a table and a bottle,” he says. “But I can go with 10 black girls, who are beautiful, and be kept on the door.“I used to have so many fights with club-owners about this. My own sister got turned away on her 40th birthday from a club I was working at – she came with six black women, they had booked a table two months in advance and there was nothing I could do to get them in. Well-dressed, smart-looking black people getting turned away.” Despite his personal objection to the policy, he continued making money from it. “I was walking away with hundreds of pounds for bringing in girls. The clubs would do a ‘quality check’ – they would give you marks out of 10 for the girls that you bring. They just need to be hot. Hot, and predominantly white.A popular Mayfair club DJ argued that while there was undoubtedly racism, it was elitism that was the main issue. “I remember once bringing two black friends to a club where I worked, and being told: ‘You cannot bring two black people in here at the same time because it looks like a gang.’ So I’m not going to deny there is racism. Some of it comes from the way the media portrays black people. Some is similar to the racism you get in the fashion industry, with this idea that black people just don’t look good.“But this is not so much about race as about money,” he says, describing how a pair of Nigerian clients at Drama regularly spent £30,000 each visiting the club. “Clubs want to attract the people who are going to spend the most, so they want good-looking people, people who look desirable and enticing, because that’s what brings in the people with money. That can work against black people, but I’ve seen it work in favour of black people too.”The importance of catering to the tastes of the super-rich is a recurring theme. Another promoter, who specialises in bringing clientele from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states to London’s clubs, said it was deciphering their wishes that led to some of the most problematic decision-making in some Mayfair clubs.“The objective of these clubs is to sell alcohol, and club-owners have built up stereotypes based on spending patterns,” he explains. “So, for example, some owners will tell you that they don’t want Asians coming in because they drink before they come out. Black people don’t drink much either. The best clients are Norwegians, because they drink a lot. So there is a kind of logic behind the way they discriminate.“Right now, it’s ‘Gulf season’. Societies like Saudi are very restrictive, but Ramadan is especially strict, so as soon as it’s finished, wealthy young people go to the other extreme. All the luxury industries in Europe try to cater to them.” Essentially, racialised stereotypes are being cited as a business model.Yet the serious nature and sheer volume of allegations of racial discrimination have attracted the attention of the local authorities, which are now investigating. When I put the allegations to Amy Lamé, London’s first night tsar, appointed by mayor Sadiq Khan, she said she was in touch with those involved. “We take these allegations extremely seriously and are working with Westminster council and the politan police to stamp this out.”A spokesperson from the council, which has responsibility for licensing – powers some have suggested should now be used to sanction nightclubs who practise discrimination – explained its plans to tackle the allegations: “Racism has no place in Westminster. That is why we have this week launched a task group to look into the standards of inclusion and access to the evening and night-time economy. This will include trading standards and issues such as discounted entry and promotions. If we find evidence of any racial discrimination we will take action.”But evidence could be hard to find. One promoter I spoke to said he could see why black clubbers claimed racism was involved, but insisted: “These clubs are based on image. The reason people come here is because of the exclusivity and glamour. If we let all of them in, it would no longer be either exclusive or glamorous. So in a way, by coming here and getting upset when they get rejected, they are victims of their own fantasy.”Is racism, even if it can be proved, actually a symptom rather than the cause of what is really going wrong in Mayfair clubs? The clubs I visited – Drama and Scandal – are unapologetic about their intentions to be elitist and discriminatory, not on grounds on race, but desirability, beauty and wealth. Scandal, for example, describes itself as “the ultimate nightlife experience for a privileged few”. It is hard not to feel unwelcome in a club that plays black music, in a city with a visible black community, where black people are noticeable by their absence. It was uncomfortable for my friend Lola and I, doing our best to enjoy the music amid the tables, stunts and strippers. But, when you consider what it says about our society, and how we cater to the whims of the super-rich, it really means a whole lot more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bd36dda1f8ae583d3eded02b4d27bf954636f58/0_0_2655_1593/master/2655.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dc46fb2f9eecdbb447307c9fce760cc","title":"merkel defends migration policy after seehofer showdown","story":"Beleaguered chancellor gives first speech to parliament since meeting with interior ministerAngela Merkel has sought to defend her government’s migration policy in her first speech to parliament since a showdown with the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, over the policing of Germany’s borders.The German chancellor spoke up for the compromise agreement the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) struck with its smaller partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU), to erect transit zones along the southern German border to speed up the deportation of ineligible asylum seekers, insisting migration had to be better regulated.“We must have more regulation regarding every type of migration, so that people have the impression that law and order are being enforced,” Merkel told a packed Bundestag, in a speech intended to show she is still in control after intense speculation that her 13-year chancellorship was about to end.Stressing that migration was a “global problem requiring a global solution” and countries could not go it alone, she said the EU’s future was dependent on a solution being found.“How we deal with the migrant question will decide whether Europe continues to exist in the future,” she said, referring to her fraught attempts to secure deals with other EU members to accept the return of refugees who had registered in their countries.At the same time, she underlined the necessity of protecting Europe’s outer borders more effectively as well as agreeing partnerships with African countries to tackle illegal migration and lessen the incentives for economic migration.But the chancellor, looking tired and pale after weeks of late-night negotiations in Brussels and Berlin, came under fire from almost all parties, in particular the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, whose parliamentary leader, Alice Weidel, demanded her immediate resignation.“Under your regime, Germany has shifted from being a motor and stability guarantor to a driver of chaos,” she said. She referred to the battle within Merkel and Seehofer’s conservative alliance as “undignified theatrics”, and Germany as “a madhouse, the headquarters of which is the chancellery”, before urging Merkel to “put an end to this tragedy – please resign at last”.While Weidel spoke, Merkel had her head down, concentrating on the finishing touches to a speech on the nation’s budget.Christian Lindner, the head of the pro-business Free Democrats, accused Merkel of having failed to find a satisfactory solution to the government’s refugee policy since the late summer of 2015, when nearly 1 million refugees arrived in Germany.He accused Merkel of failing to consult her junior coalition partner, the Social Democratic party (SPD), which crucially has yet to give its go-ahead to the transit zones. The party is in a quandary over whether to accept the zones, which many members have compared to prisons and even concentration camps, or risk the collapse of the coalition.The SPD was quick to attack Seehofer, who had offered his resignation as minister and CDU leader on Sunday, blaming him for bringing the government to the brink of collapse with his so-called migration masterplan, over certain details of which he and Merkel have been at loggerheads.Andrea Nahles, the SPD leader, said: “We don’t need masterplans, we need good craftsmanship.”Other SPD members stressed that the transit zones were a fudge, not least because on average, only five asylum seekers a day were currently attempting to enter Germany via the south.Among the fiercest critics of Seehofer was Dietmar Bartsch, the parliamentary leader of the far-left Die Linke. That Seehofer was sitting in the Bundestag on his 69th birthday, he said, should be viewed as a one-off birthday treat. “You will not be sitting here as interior minister on your 70th birthday,” he said. Bartsch accused the CSU of a ruthless attitude towards refugees, insisting the “C” in CDU and CSU no longer stood for “Christian” but for “chaos”.To resounding laughter across the chamber, he said: “I believe you would have smilingly deported Jesus.” Seehofer sat in contemplative silence, his chin in his hand, not once contributing to the debate.Merkel’s next hurdle will be to secure the support of the SPD, which has been holding emergency meetings round the clock to discuss whether it is ready to approve the transit zones, but has yet to reach a unified position, with most misgivings coming from the left wing of the party.Neighbouring Austria’s position also remains open. Its government, which on Tuesday expressed its scepticism about the transit zones, has yet to agree to back them, not least because this would require Vienna to agree to take back refugees who had registered in Austria.Seehofer is due to travel to Austria on Thursday in an attempt to hammer out a deal with the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz.In an interview with German television, Merkel gave a little more detail about the way the transit centres would work, insisting it was wrong to view them like prisons and adding that people would be kept in them for a maximum of two days. The centres work on the basis that they would house those asylum seekers who had registered in other EU countries before being returned to those countries. Asked by German television whether the new policy marked a toughening of her migration stance, and whether the once “open door” Merkel had turned into the “closing off” chancellor, she replied: “No, a clear no.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3554295.1530742657!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"country enters state of absolute drought as heatwave continues","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCalves on John Tilson’s farm at Gartnaskill, Co Cavan, cool off as temperatures remained in the high 20s on Wednesday afternoon. Photograph: Lorraine TeevanThe vast majority of the country officially enters a state of “absolute drought” today with no rainfall recorded at 24 out of 25 weather stations during the last two weeks.The extreme weather conditions has prompted Irish Water to announce that a hosepipe ban will be expanded from the Greater Dublin Area to cover the whole of the country from Friday morning.The hot dry weather is expected to continue for the foreseeable future with Met Éireann saying it does not expect any rainfall within the next 10 days.On average, demand across all water resources nationally has increased by 15 per cent, a feature Irish Water said “cannot be sustained for any period of time”.An absolute drought is defined as 15 or more consecutive days of less than 0.2mm of rainfall. The weather station at Belmullet, Co Mayo, is the only one of the State’s 25 stations to record any rainfall in the last two weeks, though some brief showers were reported in Munster yesterday evening.Senior meteorologist John Eagleton said there would be “practically nothing” in terms of rainfall for the next 10 days, the maximum time period for which Met Éireann can make predictions.Yesterday temperatures hit a maximum of 23 degrees, with the midlands experiencing the warmest conditions. The weekend will see temperatures of up to 30 degrees, “a notch below” those seen last week, according to Mr Eagleton.The average top temperatures will be around 27 or 28 degrees. Humidity levels will remain low meaning the heat will not be clammy or sticky, he said.From 8am on Friday the use of hoses in nearly all circumstances will be banned across the country. Irish Water warned the ban will likely continue until at least July 31st in order to allow water sources to replenish themselves.High demand combined with high levels of evaporation caused by the uninterrupted sunlight has caused significant depletion of rivers, lakes and reservoirs, some of which may take months to recover, Irish Water said.The ban covers the use of hoses to water gardens, wash cars or fill paddling or swimming pools. Households ignoring the ban can be fined €125, and prosecuted if they fail to pay the fine.A hosepipe ban introduced in the Greater Dublin Area on Monday has helped reduce demand from 615 million litres a day to 578 million litres.Engineers Ireland warned yesterday periodic water shortages will continue in Dublin unless water is pumped over from the river Shannon. Water resources are “inadequately maintained, unable to meet peak demand and requiring significant investment”, the group warned in a report.Yesterday parents were told to take “extreme care” in protecting their children from the sun’s harmful rays during the heatwave. The Marie Keating Foundation cancer support group said infants and children should be kept out of the sun between 11am and 3pm and factor 50 sunscreen should be applied every two hours.The Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has said it has received numerous reports of animals being trapped in the heat including about 30 horses tied up in fields with no access to shade and water. The society has also responded to four cases of dogs trapped in cars in the heat.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3554095.1530727239!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"utilities regulator seeks new director of water","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe job will involve protecting Irish Water customers and playing “a key role in the transformation of water and wastewater services in Ireland”.

Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFor all his media savvy, when meeting a group of media savvy young people, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar didn’t think his remarks would get out. File photograph: PASomething serious had to be going down.A harmless photo opportunity involving shovels and shirt-sleeves was there for the taking, but the Taoiseach cried off at short notice. He had been due to face the cameras with Ministers Eoghan Murphy and Paschal Donohoe.“This morning I came off a plane at 1.30 from New York, so that’s where I was.”The tasty photo-op was scheduled for 10am.Presuming he meant his flight departed at 1.30am Irish time, he could have made the gig if he really wanted to.That excuse has a slight ring of fake news of it.Here’s the truth.Leo Varadkar was at home, on the phone, frantically searching for the run of himself, which he has a worrying habit of losing when he travels abroad.What was it this time, sez you?He only went and insulted the media, and political journalists in particular.It happened at a lunch where he was trying to impress a group of high-flying young Irish men and women who are making it in New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of, etc.Trailblazing media, money and techie types. Leo’s kind of people. He gets them. Then they go and rat him out to journalists.He also gets Donald Trump, or at least he gets the president’s irritation with the media and “sympathises” with him. The Donald don’t get no breaks with these media bums. And Leo knows how he feels.Leo gets it. But he doesn’t appear to get how dangerous the Trump rhetoric is for truth and democracy.The Taoiseach sees hacks hanging around Leinster House in packs looking for stories. Did you ever know the like? As the Donald would say, and Leo concurred on this point over lunch with the happening youth, they aren’t interested in the truth. Although when a politician says a journalist isn’t interested in the truth it’s usually because that politician can’t handle the truth.Earlier this year in the Dáil he accused one newspaper of peddling fake news. It wasn’t. But that doesn’t matter. And in January, in Davos, he revealed his sneaking regard for Trump’s attitude to serious journalism.Anyhow, when news of the latest thrilling episode of Taoiseach on Tour hit town, the Leinster House reporters did their best to appear hugely annoyed. Amid fears tablets would have to be administered to bring down the abnormally high levels of dudgeon among the ranks, Varadkar moved to defuse the situation while his opposition counterparts shamelessly milked it.The Fianna Fáil leader talked about the homelessness crisis, blasting the government for the lack of urgency and delivery in its response to it. He cited the many announcements made about various schemes “and the media was very fair to you” and “they reported you faithfully”. Along the way, he craftily stitched in references to the media and its sympathetic treatment of him.Mary Lou McDonald abandoned any attempt to introduce a masking issue and went straight in with a few haymakers on his reported remarks on the Irish media. “You have confirmed in part these remarks that you are in sympathy with president Donald Trump and that you believe that Irish journalists have no interest in the truth.”For all the things he was saying now about context and the rest she believed “you simply wanted to have a go”.The Taoiseach came prepared with a large page covered in tiny handwritten notes, complete with big inky bullet points and shaky lines drawn around particular sentences.When he got a chance to reply, he said his piece. “I profoundly regret if anyone in the country thinks that in any way that I don’t support a free press or don’t respect the work of journalists.” Cornerstone of democracy, and all that.Although the media is not above reproach or criticism, he stressed. Which is proper order.No, it’s people like Donald Trump, or those who share his views on the media, who want to be beyond reproach.Leo is irked that what he said was leaked. “I’d like to be able to respect the privacy of that event, but obviously that isn’t now possible.” He is annoyed that what he said at the lunch was taken out of context, although people in Leinster House on Tuesday were puzzling over what context Trump’s views on the media might be acceptable.They were also puzzled by his comments about the Irish media trivialising the news and chasing tittle-tattle and gossip. (Some of us have to do it.) Leo seems to find this very distasteful. This amused Micheál Martin hugely.Too many political journalists interested in gossip? “I mean, former taoiseach Enda Kenny would have been very interested in hearing that because he considered you quite notorious in feeding the rumour mill in Leinster House on an ongoing basis with journalists and you weren’t remiss in that regard.”How very true.When we throw in fun runs and gym kits and posing with animals and novelty socks, Leo really finds himself up to his oxters in pot calling the kettle black territory.How did the Taoiseach get himself into such a pickle? For all his media savvy, when meeting a group of media savvy young people, he didn’t think his remarks would get out. The same thing happened Boris Johnson recently, and he’s supposed to be very intelligent too.Above everything, Leo seemed miffed that he was caught out.Of course, we’re all rather hurt now. How could you do this to us, Leo? You know how sensitive we are.Indeed, this has been a most difficult sketch to write.It is practically impossible to type while clutching your pearls and reaching for the smelling salts.I’m off to lie down in a darkened room."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3554204.1530731748!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and the media reputation as progressive leader is tarnished","story":"An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that he profoundly regrets if anyone thinks he does not respect the media after comments he made at a private lunch in New York.

Photograph: Win McNameeGetty ImagesFollowing the fatal shooting at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland last week, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported that the United States was the third deadliest country for journalists, behind Afghanistan, and Syria. Newsrooms around the country went on lockdown, and at the National Press Club, one block from the White House, members gathered and mourned.The comments, made to what was reportedly a group of young Irish expatriates working in media, as well as other industries, are particularly striking given the current climate of ongoing attacks against the media in the US.While a reporting fellow with the International Women’s Media Foundation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2014 , I underwent hostile environments training, fairly standard for foreign correspondents such as myself working in conflict and post-conflict zones.Trump’s attacks on the press have escalated since he became president, calling out inidual journalists by name at rallies, tweeting vitriol in their direction, and painting all media as “fake news” as a means to undermine often legitimate investigations into his conduct, relationships and ethics.Journalists have been assaulted at rallies by attendees, and security forces. They’ve been arrested while attempting to cover events. They’ve been threatened online and in person with physical harm. They’ve had their credentials revoked, and their access blocked, in a country where press freedom is so enshrined into the constitution that many consider the First Amendment – which guarantees the freedom of expression by prohibiting Congress from restricting the press or the rights of iniduals to speak freely – the cornerstone of American democracy.In the US, Varadkar is seen largely as the face of a modern, multicultural society. The images of him marching proudly with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau – who immediately and forcefully issued support for journalists and condolences to the victims of the Annapolis shooting – his support of Repeal the Eighth, and his joining the St Patrick’s Day parade in New York City this year with his partner Matt Barrett signaled an Ireland that cares for the rights of its people, and people around the world.That image offers a stark contrast to the current image of the US, where access to reproductive health care is becoming more and more restrictive, the Supreme Court just voted that a baker could deny a gay couple a wedding cake, and harsh immigration policies signal a vision of America\u0026nbspthat is at odds both with our founding, and our current existence.With Varadkar’s comments on the media – and his siding with Trump – that reputation as a progressive, global leader is tarnished. Instead, it appears that Varadkar all too readily adopted the anti-press rhetoric of a reality show executive with a history of manipulating the media now frustrated to discover he can’t edit the ugly bits away in post-production. It might endear Varadkar to the current US administration, but that effect is likely to be short-lived.Varadkar’s bid for the UN Security Council seat comes at a time when Ireland has dropped two places on the Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index, due to the country’s consolidation of its media companies.If Varadkar truly wants Ireland to take its place at the centre of international peace, security and development, what better way, and in what better time, for him to position Ireland as a leader in championing a free and independent press the world over, where journalists are able to practise without threat of harm or death, from its citizens or its leaders.The opportunity is there, and it’s worth seizing.Molly McCluskey is a former EU correspondent in Ireland and the UK and is now based in the US, where she is a journalist, public speaker, and press freedom advocate.

They were discharged in May and are at a secure location.Novichok was identified as the compound used in the attack by experts at the science and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down. Novichok is not a single toxin but a family of  so called fourth generation nerve agents developed by the Russians in the 1970s and 1980s. In some forms, it is reported to be between five and eight times more toxic than earlier nerve agents, such as VX. It can be stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients which, when mixed, react to produce the weaponised nerve agent. This makes it easier to transport and handle – an advantage for an assassin.Michelle Carlin, senior lecturer in forensic and analytical chemistry at Northumbria University, said that it can be used in the form of an ultra-fine powder as well as as a liquid or vapour. It kills after being ingested or absorbed through the skin.Is it the same batch that affected the Skripals?Dr Carlin said it would be unusual if the couple had been affected by nerve agent from the same source as that used against the Skripals four months ago.She said the new case was surprising and, while it is difficult to speculate over where the poison came from, it would be unexpected if it were from same source.It is difficult to speculate whether this is from the original source used in the Skripal case however, if it was from the same source, it is unusual that it has taken four months for someone to be affected by it, Dr Carlin said.Novichok in Salisbury: How could this happen four months after Skripal attack?What is the risk to the general public?Professor Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, said the Skripal episode meant officials had a well-established response in place.She said: You do not need to seek advice from a health professional unless you are experiencing symptoms.She also urged not to pick up any unknown or already dangerous objects such as needles and syringes.What should I do if I visited these locations?You should clean clothing and items you had with you while you were there.Clothing that is dry-clean only should be put in two plastic bags (ie. a double layer), tied at the top and stored safely – PHE is reviewing the best way of cleaning these items and will publish information in due course.Items such as phones and handbags should be cleaned with baby wipes. Jewellery, watches and glasses should be washed with warm water and detergent and then rinsed in clean cold water.Should I destroy items of clothing?Public Health England says this is not necessary but if you want to do this put them in two plastic bags, tie them at the top and dispose of  it in an outdoor bin in the normal way.What effect does Novichok have on the body?Novichok, like all nerve agents, disrupts the chemical signals between the nerves and the muscles which control vital organs, said Dr Carlin.This can lead to breathing difficulties, loss of control of bodily functions, increased salivation, convulsions, paralysis.”Outward symptoms may include white eyes, convulsions, drooling and – in the worse cases – coma, respiratory failure and death.Nerve agents can act within minutes but they can also take hours to take effect. Much depends on the exact toxin, the dose and the delivery method. What is the treatment for those exposed to Novichok?Patients exposed to nerve agents are normally given the drug atropine, which reduces muscle spasms and the production of saliva. It needs to be given as soon after exposure as possible – ideally within minutes.It is likely that atropine was used to treat the Skripals, said Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds.Doctors may also use a drug called pralidoxime, an antidote to organophosphate pesticides and chemicals.Treatments for exposure to nerve agentsWhat are the long-term effects of exposure?Little is known about this, although exposure is thought to lead to long-term harm. One of the Russian scientists who helped develop Novichok, Andrei Zheleznyakov, was accidentally exposed and, according to a book about the history of chemical weapons, War of Nerves by Jonathan Tucker, he suffered permanent ill health including hepatitis, epilepsy, severe depression and an inability to concentrate. He died five years after exposure.The Moscow weapons lab that made the deadly Novichok nerve agentIs there a wider risk from Novichok and other chemical and biological weapons in the UK?The greatest risk comes from the fact that the taboo on the use of chemical weapons, which has held for much of the last 100 years, appears to be breaking down.Politician\u0027s must bend every sinew to reestablish this red line, said Hamish De Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of the UK Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Regiment.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyNHS at 70: the charts that show how the health service has changed since 1948Comment: Let’s celebrate the new Englishness and become a nation of flag waversArmy recruits are being turned away for minor ailments such as eczema despite chronic shortage of troopsAlesha MacPhail: Scottish island on \u0026#39lockdown\u0026#39 as police question teenage murder suspectNovichok in Salisbury: The public thought it was safe ... so how could this happen four months later?Novichok poisons two new victims: Salisbury couple in comas after contact with nerve agent used on SkripalsDark past of Porton Down: The secret nerve agent tests that led to the death of a serviceman  Comment: Why Novichok could be Russia\u0026#39s most terrifying weapon in a war with the WestRevealed: The Moscow weapons lab that made the deadly Novichok nerve agentWhat is Novichok?

But, despite the heat wave temperatures on Wednesday afternoon, the park was empty.Late on Tuesday, Scottish police confirmed that six-year-old Alesha had been murdered and that, as a precaution, told islanders to look out for each other and please look out for your families and the security and safety of your homes.On Wednesday night, police announced that they had arrested a male youth on suspicion of Alesha\u0027s murder. The teenage boy faces further police questioning after his arrest while police repeated a call for information as officers continue their investigation.Anyone who has CCTV at their home or business, or indeed any motorists with dashcam footage which might help with our investigation, are also urged to get in touch, Detective Superintendent Stuart Houston said.Alesha\u0027s grandparents Angela King, 46, and Calum MacPhail, 49, live in the Victorian seaside resort Rothesay, in a house that overlooks the Firth of Clyde and out towards the mainland.Its front garden was supposed to be a place where Alesha\u0027s laughter was heard this summer. But instead, the pavement nearby was lined on Wednesday with flowers, cuddly toys and messages. In the middle, her school photo rests next to two pink balloons. A message said: “So, so going to miss you.”Across the road, a pebbly beach was roped off by police tape. A seagull bobbed lazily on clear waters as local resident Bob Mason, 73, looked at the crime scene.“It’s paradise, it’s beautiful,” said Mason, who lived around the corner from the house. “There’s very little crime, I don’t lock my door, most people don’t.On Wednesday night, police had shifted their focus away from the wooded area where Alesha\u0027s body was discovered. A forensics team was seen at the grandparent’s house, where she had been staying along with her father, Rab MacPhail, 25, and his girlfriend when she went missing. Among evidence collected from the property were two cars that were removed over the course of the day.The news shocked the residents of seaside town, which has long been a holiday resort off the west coast of Scotland. Locals commend the tight-knit community and its absence of crime.Tributes and flowers for Alesha left outside her grandparent\u0026#39s house Local councilor Len Scoullar said: “The community is very dismayed and disappointed that such a thing could happen here. We don’t have crime rates that include things like child abuse and murder.”  Alesha had come to Bute for the summer. On Monday morning, at 6:25am, Angela sent out a plea on Facebook asking friends and neighbours to help her find her granddaughter who had gone missing in the night.Two and a half hours later, a neighbour discovered the girl’s body in public woods less than a mile away from the house.Alesha lived on the mainland in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, with her mother, Georgina Lachrane. The 23-year-old discovered her daughter was missing when she saw the Facebook message.Someone tell me what\u0027s happened to my daughter, Lachrane commented. Angela answer me now.Police forensic officers at the house on Ardbeg RoadPolice later brought Lachrane to the island, where she was seen in tears as she laid a tribute to her daughter.Local resident Winnie Watters, 79, said: They\u0027re such a lovely family. The granddad plays bowls and everyone says he\u0027s a great man. I get the bus with the grandma sometimes and she\u0027s lovely too.lt was that little girl\u0027s highlight, coming to see her grandparents in the holidays. I heard from someone that she\u0027d sleepwalked and maybe got lost or fallen, but I don\u0027t know. You hear a lot of rumours.Less than 7,000 people live on Bute, which is home to Mount Stuart House, the stately home where fashion designer Stella McCartney got married. Prince Charles is the Duke of Rothesay.In the centre of town, near the seafront, three young local girls in summer dresses ate ice creams and kicked a balloon.They seemed to have no cares in the world, but the eldest is the same age as Alesha, and was friends with her.Six-year-old Alesha Macphail\u0026#39s body was found in a wooded area by a member of the publicThe girls\u0027 father, who was sitting on a bench keeping an eye on them and did not want to be named, said: It\u0027s terrible. We know the family. It\u0027s hard sleeping at night in case anything happens. I just hope they get who it was. I\u0027ve never seen Rothesay like this, it\u0027s in lockdown. I feel so terrible for the family.Former oil industry caterer Ian Colville, who runs a coffee shop on the seafront and lives near where the schoolgirl was staying, said: There\u0027s a lot of young kids playing out there all the time but for the last three days there have been none at all.At Cafe Zavaroni\u0027s on the seafront, owner Margaret Zavaroni, cousin of the late former Scottish child singing star, Lena Zavaroni, said the town was far quieter than usual.I\u0027ve never heard of anything like this happening on the island. You can let your kids play out all night and if any kids went missing they\u0027d be found in five minutes because everyone knows everyone. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s out of respect but I\u0027ve only had two lots of families with kids in today, normally it would be packed.Police told residents to keep their children safeBute has a faded charm as an old seaside resort and remains popular with daytrippers from nearby Glasgow who still enjoy trips doon the water on the historic Waverley paddle steamer which still goes along the Clyde.The last murder on Bute was 30 years ago, when two paedophiles killed Allison McGarrigle and dumped her body at sea. McGarrigle, whose body has never been found, went missing in 1997 and was declared dead in 2005.  Councillor Scoullar said: “Rothesay has always been the safest place for ladies and children, but that’s been proved wrong.“Let’s hope when the police get to the bottom of this it goes back to the way it has always been.”NHS at 70: the charts that show how the health service has changed since 1948Comment: Let’s celebrate the new Englishness and become a nation of flag waversArmy recruits are being turned away for minor ailments such as eczema despite chronic shortage of troopsNovichok in Salisbury: The public thought it was safe ... so how could this happen four months later?Novichok poisons two new victims: Salisbury couple in comas after contact with nerve agent used on SkripalsDark past of Porton Down: The secret nerve agent tests that led to the death of a serviceman  Comment: Why Novichok could be Russia\u0026#39s most terrifying weapon in a war with the WestRevealed: The Moscow weapons lab that made the deadly Novichok nerve agentWhat is Novichok?

Weaver, a regular soldier, Private A.D. Maile, a National Serviceman thought to have joined in June or July 1949, and Private W. Philpot, who was wounded and captured and never seen again.“It has been a long time since these men went missing and I expect it will be difficult to identify them after all these years, but everything should be done to confirm their identities and give them the burial they deserve”, said Sam Mercer, who was a private with the Gloucester Regiment - the “Glorious Glosters” - and was captured in the infamous Battle of the Imjin River in April 1951.In the encounter, some 650 men of the regiment defied an estimated 10,000 Chinese troops to hold a key position and blunt an attack that would have overwhelmed Seoul and turned the tide in favour of the Chinese-North Korean alliance.“We had a job to do and I think we did it rather well, giving the Chinese a bloody nose in the process”, said Mr Mercer, 88, who now lives in Streatham, South London.Sam Mercer MBE, 88, served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Gloucestershire Regiment Injured in the early stages of the battle, Mr Mercer lost an eye and was among hundreds who could not be evacuated and went into captivity.And because he was unable to move fast enough, a Chinese soldier shot him in the leg.Mr Mercer puts his survival during two years in a North Korean POW camp down to “a combination of determination, bloody-mindedness and a large slice of lady luck” - but he knows of at least two British POWs who died in captivity and were interred in the North.“A lot of time has elapsed, but they should be brought home”, he said.According to Frank Fallows, the chairman of the British Korean War Veterans Association, a total of 336 British military personnel are still listed as missing.Of that number, 50 were members of the Royal Navy or merchant navy and are considered lost at sea. The remaining 286 were with regular British Army regiments, the Royal Marines or Royal Air Force.Some 1,108 British troops died in the Korean War and 106 spent time in POW camps in North Korea.Edgar Green, who served as a private in the Middlesex Regiment, believes it is very possible that British troops may have been mistaken for US personnel.The truce village at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) which separates the two Koreas“We arrived in Busan from Hong Kong August 1950 wearing our tropical kit, but a few months later it was well below freezing and we were issued with American cold-weather equipment”, he told The . “I know of at least two Middlesex Regiment men who were captured and assumed to be Americans because of the clothes they were wearing. Both of them were very badly treated and died in POW camps.”Mr Green, 87 and now living in Aldermaston in Berkshire, firmly believes that the remains of British soldiers should be returned from the North and, if they cannot be repatriated to the UK, then they should be interred with the vast majority of other British casualties of the conflict at the United Nations Military Cemetery in Busan.A total of 885 British personnel are already buried at the cemetery.“I may be old, but I would go to any funeral for a British soldier that they return”. Mr Green said.“I cannot begin to explain the sense of camaraderie that we had then and still have today”, he added.Please review our commenting policyNHS at 70: the charts that show how the health service has changed since 1948Army recruits are being turned away for minor ailments such as eczema despite chronic shortage of troopsComment: Let’s celebrate the new Englishness and become a nation of flag waversAlesha MacPhail: Scottish island on \u0026#39lockdown\u0026#39 as police question teenage murder suspectNovichok in Salisbury: The public thought it was safe ... so how could this happen four months later?Novichok poisons two new victims: Salisbury couple in comas after contact with nerve agent used on SkripalsDark past of Porton Down: The secret nerve agent tests that led to the death of a serviceman  Comment: Why Novichok could be Russia\u0026#39s most terrifying weapon in a war with the WestRevealed: The Moscow weapons lab that made the deadly Novichok nerve agentWhat is Novichok?

The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations.

The PLSA has commissioned researchers to develop these.Seven in 10 people think retirement income targets would encourage them to save more, increasing to more than 78 per cent of millennials aged 18 to 34, the PLSA found.While a third\u0026nbspof people say they could save more for retirement, uncertainty about how much cash they will need may be holding people back, the report suggests.Automatic enrolment into workplace pensions was introduced in 2012 to head off fears of a later life savings crisis.Minimum contribution rates into workplace pensions are gradually being stepped up to encourage people to save more.But many people wrongly assume that this minimum level is the target they should be aiming for to be comfortably off, the report found.The minimum auto-enrolment pension contribution rate is 5 per cent, increasing to 8 per cent next year. Rates are made up of contributions from staff and employers.Just over half of people wrongly believe the minimum rates are the recommended amount to save.Pension schemes and life insurance payouts at stake because of lowUnder new state pension rules we will all be much worse offMoney roundup video: Bogus landlords\u0027 warning and pension freedomThe report also said minimum contribution levels for automatic enrolment should be boosted from 8 per cent of band earnings to 12 per cent of total salary between 2025 and 2030, with at least 50 per cent of this coming from employers to ensure it is affordable for savers.Nigel Peaple, director of policy and research at the PLSA, said: “Millions of savers are in the dark about whether they\u0027re on track for the lifestyle they want in retirement.“With future generations unlikely to have the same levels of property wealth, or final salary pensions, as current retirees do, it\u0027s vital more is done to ensure people can cover the costs of later life.”Around 1,500 people aged 18 to state pension age (SPA) were surveyed for the report.Sir Steve Webb, a former pensions minister who is now director of policy at Royal London, said: “One of the most commonly asked questions in pensions is: \u0027How much do I need to save?\u0027.“A system of retirement income targets would help people to work out what sort of retirement they could expect if they save at varying levels.“This would also enable pensions to be presented in a positive light as giving people choices over their quality of life in retirement, rather than trying to make people feel guilty about not saving enough - a strategy which has never worked in the past.”Baroness Altmann, another former pensions minister, said: “It is certainly true that people are not sure how much they should be contributing to a pension, to secure themselves a comfortable retirement.“It is also very worrying that so many people think the auto-enrolment minimum levels are an appropriate amount - they are unlikely to deliver a large private pension.“But most people need help with financial planning and would benefit from having an independent expert adviser to monitor their savings over time and recommend what they should do.”She continued: “Pension planning is not an exact science and your pension fund needs to be monitored regularly. If you do not have enough saved, you could decide to keep working longer and save more.”Mr McQueen said: “It\u0027s good to see the PLSA agree with Aviva\u0027s view that minimum automatic enrolment contributions should be increased from 8 per cent to 12 per cent of earnings by 2030.”A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: “Automatic enrolment was introduced so that people who were previously saving nothing towards their retirement could start saving into a workplace pension. Almost 10 million people have been enrolled so far.“We have brought in phased contribution rate increases for workplace pensions and are committed to an ongoing review to ensure we continue to balance the need to save with everyday costs.“For those who would like guidance on their pension, Pension Wise is a free and impartial government service which can help.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That means for instance that an apple and a cannonball, falling from a tower, will reach the ground at the same time.But some worried that might not always be true. In cases of extreme gravity, it was thought, alternative kinds of gravitational behaviour might be observed.By testing the theory in perhaps the most extreme environment possible – in a massive three-star system – the theory still applies.This research shows how routine and careful observation of distant stars can give us a high-precision test of one of the fundamental theories of physics, said Ingrid Stairs, professor in the department of physics and astronomy at UBC and a co-author of the study.The research was done in what scientists referred to as a natural laboratory –\u0026nbspa triple star system called PSR J0337+1715, located about 4,200 light-years from Earth. The extreme conditions there serve as a useful way for scientists to perform tests in such situations.This is a unique star system, said Ryan Lynch of the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, and coauthor on the paper. We don\u0027t know of any others quite like it. That makes it a one-of-a-kind laboratory for putting Einstein\u0027s theories to the test.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

Since the inner white dwarf is not as massive or compact as the neutron star, if the theories gravitational binding energy had an effect then it would be possible to see it from Earth.The researchers didn\u0027t see any effect, suggesting that Einstein\u0027s theory of relativity holds true even at such vast scales.\u0026nbspIf there is a difference, it is no more than three parts in a million, said coauthor Nina Gusinskaia of the University of Amsterdam.Theory of relativityEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

blacklist communists information research department ird","story":"Created with Sketch.In 1949 the man who conceived Big Brother gave a semi-secret government department a list of 38 ‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.“The list invites us to reflect again on the asymmetry of our attitudes toward\u0026nbspNazism and communism,” wrote Garton Ash, whose own experiences of being spied on by the communist East German Stasi informed his book The File. \u0026nbspWhat if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening lines in literature115 Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a

They are considered a near threatened species, and there is a global trade in their tusks.The Ivory Bill being considered by\u0026nbspParliament includes a power for ministers to extend the proposed ban on selling items made from elephant ivory to other ivory-bearing species covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), including sperm whales and killer whales.\u0026nbspBut now the Government has \u0026nbspbrought forward an amendment to the bill that could extend the bn to all ivory-bearing animals, not just those covered by Cites.This would allow the ban to be extended to species such as warthogs and even the tusks of prehistoric mammoths, which some believe increases demand for elephant ivory, if a case for their inclusion was made during the consultation.The consultation will begin as soon as posible after the bill\u0026nbsp becomes law, and will not delay the introduction of the ban on dealings in elephant ivory, ministers said.Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: “Our ivory ban is one of the toughest in the world and will provide vital protection for the African and Asian elephant from the scourge of illegal poachin“But there are many more precious species, like the hippo and walrus, which could fall victim to the callous trade in ivoryUK news in picturesBritish police officers stand facing a residential property in Amesbury, England, Wednesday, July 4, 2018.

What I meant to say was that the NAO had said that there was no practical alternative to continuing with universal credit.”In his letter Sir Amyas said it was “odd” that Ms McVey told MPs that the NAO did not take into account recent changes in the administration of universal credit, when the report had in fact been “fully agreed” with senior officials at the Department for Work and Pensions only days earlier.He added that Ms McVey’s claim that the NAO was concerned that universal credit was rolling out too slowly was “not correct”.UK news in picturesBritish police officers stand facing a residential property in Amesbury, England, Wednesday, July 4, 2018.

The Central Bank of Venezuela, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, has not independently released inflation figures in at least a year.\u0026nbspVenezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has passed blame for the roiled economy onto others, including opposition activists and officials in Washington. At a campaign rally in May, he blamed hyperinflation on criminal mafias.But economists point out that Mr Maduro runs the unorthodox policies they say have pushed the country into economic crisis. The socialist leader has repeatedly refused international aid to Venezuela.It\u0027s internal, Professor Hanke said. Government spending continues to accelerate and the sources of revenue start drying up.The government has defaulted on a majority of their outstanding bonds, which economists estimate add up to about $60 billion (£45 million). Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

A recent university study found that about 90 percent of civilians were living in poverty last year and most of those surveyed had lost an average of 25 pounds in body weight.\u0026nbspThe hyperinflation is devastating the economy, said Andres Abadia, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He expects the economy to contract in 2018, for a fifth consecutive year, and sees no turnaround in the near-term.Mr Abadia said Venezuela is a disaster area and that as long as Mr Maduro is in power, the economy will continue to collapse. But Mr Maduro reaffirmed his\u0026nbsptight grip on power last month, easily winning\u0026nbspanother six-year term in what was widely condemned as a fraudulent election.\u0026nbspMr Maduro tripled wages earlier in June to 3 million bolivars per month, which Reuters reported at the time was equal to just more than a dollar at the black-market exchange rate.When asked if the wage increase might improve living conditions in Venezuela, Professor Hanke replied: No, it\u0027s a joke.

Perhaps some isolated thundery showers in places. Probably cloudier and cooler in the north west Thursday.The World Meteorological Organisation definition of a heatwave is when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5C, the normal period being 1961-1990.They are most common in summer when high pressure develops across an area.High-pressure systems are slow moving and can persist over an area for a prolonged period of time such as days or weeks.They can occur in the UK due to the location of the jet stream, which is usually to the north of the UK in the summer.This can allow high pressure to develop over the UK resulting in persistent dry and settled weather.The scorching summer of 1976 was the hottest summer since records began.It led to a severe drought owing to the exceptionally dry conditions, although it is thought that 1995 was drier.In the summer of 1976, Heathrow had 16 consecutive days over 30C from June 23 to July 8, and for 15 consecutive days from June 23 to July 7 temperatures reached 32.2C somewhere in England.But the single hottest temperature of 38.5C was set on August 10, 2003.When the mercury shoots up there are several obvious precautions to take.It is advised to make sure you drink a lot of water to make sure you stay hydrated during the hot spell.Keeping a bottle of sunscreen with you to soak up those UV rays is also highly advisable as is ensuring you have a hat to prevent sunstroke."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-life stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.

Way better, in fact, without wanting to sling mud, than many other commentators who — regardless of their gender — can barely string two words together.Because, of course, whether or not you are good at your job has got absolutely nothing to do with your gender, right?Until, that is, you are a woman in football, or some other realm that men consider belongs to them.Then, it turns out, it’s a problem. For some men at least.Just to be clear, the idea that football is a “guy thing” is totally outdated. More women watch football in the UK than watch EastEnders (and that’s when there isn’t a World Cup on).And that’s just watching it. I’ll get on to playing it in a minute.Still, Simon Kelner, the former editor of the Independent, wrote in a column this week that women talking about World Cup games “is like getting a netball player to discuss major league basketball”.Then former player Jason Cundy gave his five cents worth, saying that women are unsuited to commentate on football matches because “their voices are too high”.And — although I had to watch it from behind a cushion because I was cringing so much — former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra gave Eni Aluko an actual round of applause for her analysis of one match. . . because he was so surprised that women, you know, know stuff about football too.(Her face when he did so was priceless: Withering look personified.)In case you didn’t know, Eni Aluko has more than 100 caps for England as a player. She also has a first-class degree in law. She is super brainy, bright and articulate — and she knows an awful lot about football.I am full of admiration for her. She is such a strong woman. She is also more than qualified to comment on a football match.Sadly, “more than qualified” is often what women need to be to get ahead in a male world.Eni Aluko is a high-powered lawyer, a professional sportswoman who adds serious value to the commentary of any match.Patrice Evra must know her credentials. But some men, when they feel threatened by a woman, respond by patronising her. They try to put her down. Diminish her. Banish her back into her box.As a woman working in sport I am familiar with this.Lots of men who think women in football are encroaching on “their” territory do the same to me. The number of suggestions I’ve had to get back in the kitchen — and far worse — are too many to count.It doesn’t bother me. But it is tedious and annoying.Men who respond to women in this way can’t quite accept that a new generation of women are coming to the fore and using their voice.They really can’t get their heads around the changes that are happening so quickly — the emergence of women who are using their voice, taking “their” jobs.Luckily, they are a dying breed, these men who want to keep women in the Victorian ages.Plus, it is beginning to dawn on them that we aren’t going back into the box.And they’d better get used to it because it’s not just women commentating on football who are being taken more seriously. It’s women who are playing it too.I’m proud and excited to say that West Ham is one of 11 clubs with new Women’s Super League licences.This really is going to change the face of women’s football.Tier one, the Women’s Super League, starts next year and West Ham is part of that.And the Super League is going to mean a lot more money, professionalism and structure for women in football.So to anyone who is worried about female match commentators all I can say is: Hold on to your hats, boys.REBEKAH Vardy got slammed this week for speaking out about being in Russia.She said that she took the role of supporting her husband – and being there for him before a match – very seriously, saying: “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed, knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.”Of course, some wasted no time laying into Rebekah’s version of feminism since it included being present for her husband which – according to comments I read – undermines feminist values.I have to say I really disagree.Whoever said that you can’t be a feminist and also stand by your man?I LOVED reading about Christine Lampard, who is pregnant, saying she, “couldn’t care less” about putting on weight as long as everything’s OK inside.In an age when many pregnant women barely look like they are expecting, only to “snap back into shape” within days of giving birth, that’s such a refreshing attitude. I felt the same way and allowed myself to eat what I wanted.I know some women crave chalk and coal when they are pregnant but my craving was for Wagon Wheels.At one point I was on about 12 a day. Those were the days.JOOLS Oliver says that being a stay-at-home mum is ten times harder than Jamie’s job running a multi-million-pound cooking empire.She described her role as “brain numbing” and “hell on earth” and said no one respects her in the household. I’m sure lots of eyes will roll at that idea, but I have to say that I agree.The brief run-in I had with being a stay-at-home mum left me full of nothing but admiration and respect for those women who do it on a daily basis.And it made going back to work feel like a walk in the park.LET’S congratulate New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, for being only the second woman ever to give birth while in such senior office.Some people have questioned whether Jacinda can do the job as a new parent. Would that same question ever be asked of a man?WELL this is exciting. Scientists are apparently closer than ever to inventing an invisibility cloak.I’m sure it’s intended for use by top secret agents intent on saving the world.But all I can think about is what a great accessory it would be for any party at which there are people you don’t fancy talking to.Or for eavesdropping on Apprentice candidates.Or spying on the half-time huddle of any team West Ham is playing.In fact, the possibilities are endless.HONESTLY there is no pleasing some people. The number of moans I have heard this week about people who think it is too hot.Just cast your mind back to the past couple of years when it rained solidly for most of June and July – and count your lucky stars.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not Piers, who went on to issue a further challenge: “On Thursday night, you can watch England destroy Belgium, then watch me destroy Love Island straight after.”So I did. No further comment is needed on the first bit of Piers’ equation. But, hell on TV earth, I can’t ignore the second.A “one-off special” called Good Evening Britain which attempted to cash in on the breakfast magic and must have seemed like a great idea until England v Belgium became a loser-takes-all non-event, the wardrobe department shoved Susanna Reid into a Spanish Flamenco dancer’s outfit and someone lost control of the guest list.’Cos all of the pre-publicity for this one assured me there’d be just three present: Danny Dyer, the Labour Party leader and a slightly spooked Pamela Anderson, who set the first alarm ringing by claiming: “When they told me Jeremy Corbyn’s going to be here I thought this was going to be a serious political ­programme.”Why the hell a dissembling old fool like Corbyn would make anyone think that is a bit of a mystery, but ­serious was the last word you’d use to describe Good Evening Britain.They weren’t alone either. The joint was jumping, in fact, with David Ginola, Amir Khan, Ed Balls, Tory MP James Cleverly, Harry Redknapp, BGT comic Daliso Chaponda and live feeds from a reporter in Russia and Andi Peters at Emmerdale’s Woolpack pub.As GEB quickly demonstrated, of course, the reason chat shows don’t invite nine guests to appear is that you instantly have nine chaotic voices clamouring for attention and often talking at cross-purposes.All it then takes is one guest to throw a spanner in the works and the whole vibe collapses, as it duly did when Piers and Susanna started asking Pammie about her French footballer boyfriend, Adil Rami, who she claimed was “doing really well”.Susanna: “He’s not played yet.” I haven’t been watching, I’ve been looking after my father who’s just had a stroke.” When someone drops a bombshell like that, clearly, you need to steer the conversation away pretty sharpish which, in fairness, Piers did by asking Amir Khan: “Do you have a sex ban before fights?”Only with his wife, I’d imagine, Piers, but thanks for asking. It set the perfectly awkward tone for the entire evening. For GEB to be classed as a true TV disaster, though, it still needed three other things to happen.The first were technical glitches, which duly arrived when the satellite link to a bunch of drunk England fans went down. The second was Andi Peters referring to Emmerdale as “Coronation Street”. Check.The third and most important, however, was for one of the guests to get a bit sweary and lairy. Enter Danny Dyer who ensured GEB will enter TV folklore, when he launched into Brexit, asking: “What’s happened to that t**t David Cameron? He’s in Nice with his trotters up. He should be held to account for it . . . t**t.”The far more pertinent bit of his ­contribution, though, was the moment he addressed the host: “Just stop talking, Piers. Just talkin’ talkin’, ramblin’ on.”Breakfast TV would be a hopelessly dull, molly-coddling chore again without Piers’ ego and all his boastful predictions, which just for the record, ended with the following score, on Thursday.Good Evening Britain — 2.91million viewers. Love Island — 3.2million. Boom.Martin Keown: “When you play in midfield you’ve got to have legs.”Guy Mowbray: “We haven’t seen anything of Di Maria in Argentina’s first three games. Although he only played in two of them.”Alan Shearer: “Portugal were very much like Portugal.”And Lee Dixon: “We’ve had five balls that have gone flat. Three times that’s happened.”(Compiled by Graham Wray).WHATEVER our differences elsewhere, I hope there’s one thing on which we’re all agreed.The greatest quiz show in television history is Bullseye.An opinion confirmed when I tapped those magic eight letters into my Sky Planner’s search engine last week, and its back catalogue unfurled before me, including episode one of series one, which, for a TV critic, is like finding the source of the Nile.I don’t expect you to watch every episode, obviously, but if you have time for one, make it episode eight of series two. It’s as funny, heart-warming and brilliantly formatted as you remember. But the most remarkable thing is, hardly any of it would now be considered fit for broadcast.For not only is Jocky Wilson smoking a fag as he attempts the 301 or more challenge, Jim Bowen, can’t help drawing attention to a facial scar on a contestant’s face.“You’ve obviously had an accident, tell us how.” “I was 11 years old, it was a petrol can blew up on a building site.” “Lovely to be able to talk about that, smashing.”Broadsheet newspaper columnists, right-on comedians and other handbag-clasping s of the nation’s morals will, of course, say: “Well thank goodness we’ve moved on since then.” Which is precisely the reason none of them will ever create a show as beautiful as Bullseye or say anything remotely as funny as the bellowing climax to the prize board, on show eight.Bully’s special prize?“What every woman dreams of. A full-length Scandinavian mink coat.”RANDOM TV irritations: Jeremy Corbyn’s insanely annoying habit of giving a triumphant little sniff every time he thinks he’s made a good point.BBC presenters turning Aneurin Bevan into the L Ron Hubbard of their NHS cult. News ­reporters describing everything that’s happened quite a lot as being: “On an industrial scale.”Over-familiar BBC continuity announcers suddenly greeting me with a: “Hi, I’m Russell.” (Don’t care.) And a bite massage therapist from Hollywood called Doctor Dot failing to provide the necessary health and safety warning before she told This Morning’s Eamonn Holmes: “Ruth’s going to be biting you tonight.”’Cos she’d have bitten off more than she could chew if she did.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “Alphabetically, what day of the week comes first?” Andy: “Tuesday.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “In which decade of the 19th Century was the Crimean War fought?”Simon: “The 1950s.”Andrew O’Keefe: “TV series Twin Peaks is set in which fictional town?”Dan: “Transylvania.”“No, Twin Peaks.” NHS cultists gathered last week to applaud, grovel, sing, dance and grin like madmen in its honour.I exaggerate a bit, obviously. The singing and dancing doesn’t begin until tomorrow night on ITV.It was still an unsettling experience though, watching BBC2’s NHS At 70: Live, from The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Birmingham, hosted by Anita Rani a level eight cultist from The One Show, Nick Robinson and Helen Skelton, who was in the maternity unit warning that we may “hear screaming”.As well as the massed ranks of staff, there were also NHS bigwigs and former patients who were encouraged to stand, clap and thank nurses, doctors, ambulancemen, chemists, the woman on reception, everyone.The nasty suspicion is, of course, that all this BBC worship, which makes Kim Jong-un’s birthday celebrations look really half-ar*ed, carries a political edge and is designed to shut down every single argument apart from the ones that say:A)The NHS needs more money. Or B) the NHS needs a s***load more money.As righteous as it might make them all feel, however, deep down they know it makes for wretchedly dull television.Hence the presence, on this one, of Britain’s Got Talent winner Lost Voice Guy, who not even the resuscitation unit could help with gags like: “Laughter is the best medicine. So instead of going to hospital when you crack your head open you will be prescribed tickets to go and see Russell Brand . . .”AAAAAAAAARRGH!The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “In 2017 which Hollywood star was made a dame at the age of 100?”Will: “Joan Collins.” Oof.King Kylian Mbappe taking the World Cup by the scruff of the neck with France’s thrilling 4-3 victory over Argentina.The Sky Planner’s damningly accurate verdict on Bear’s Mission With Warwick Davis: “Contains scenes of moderate peril.”Love Island narrator Iain Stirling breaking into a water fight discussion to announce: “God I’m lonely.” And the magnificent Laura going all Malcolm Tucker on Wes after he admitted he wanted to “crack on with Megan”.“Do me a favour then, f*** off.” Truly, hell hath no fury like a Scottish woman scorned.GOOD Morning Britain, Wednesday,  rent-a-gob Afua “problematic” Hirsch says: “I am English, but why do I feel uncomfortable ­answering that question?”Because if you ever stopped playing the professional victim and admitted this great liberal democracy had afforded you all the most ­extraordinary privileges in life, including an ­expensive private education, you’d swiftly have no point, purpose, job or income, obviously.ON Monday’s This Morning, the arrival of “Britain’s Sexiest Cow”, a Jersey milker called Char, prompted the obvious Schofield question: “What was the competition?”Two Friesians, an English Longhorn and Naomi Campbell, I’d imagine.THIS week’s winner is Simon Cowell and a Hawaiian feather god from the Royal Academy’s forthcoming Oceania exhibition, which you’ve probably booked already.Emailed in by Spud, of London.Picture research: Amy Reading.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they do.Remarkably, one in 20 British nurseries is banning superhero costumes because they believe these colourful outfits are making our children aggressive.This attempted taming of tots doesn’t stop there though.Four in five nurseries won’t allow any weapons — whether they are plastic pirate ­cutlasses or harmless pop guns.This is totally wrong.When I was with my mates on the school yard or messing about on building sites I ­pretended to be Superman or ­a soldier, replaying what I had seen in John Wayne war films.These games teach you vital lessons that you will carry on into later life, like I did with the military.There is kinship, holding your own and negotiating with the kid who is getting a bit rowdy.I learned right and wrong, how to ­interact with others and when I was ­stepping out of line.But it didn’t make me think: “I want to join the Army and kill everyone.” ­Everyone plays those games, and some become accountants.I certainly allowed my daughter to play “fighting” and there is no evidence such activities make people more violent.When kids get out their toy swords or bows there is laughter and joy.This is about the normal competitive urge. Whether it’s sport, watching The X Factor or wishing to be top in your class, there is a desire to win.It is wrong to pretend ­otherwise, because when these kids enter the real world of work they will face a very ­competitive atmosphere.If you don’t fight to get to the top, you will go under.We can’t all be soft and cuddly. ­Societies need people with different talents and attitudes.There is a clear antipathy towards the armed services as a career in these ­nursery bans.Britain is struggling to find new recruits at the moment, and the last thing we need is children growing up believing this is a bad choice.Being a soldier, sailor or part of the RAF are valid ­professions. We need these real-life superheroes.My daughter considered ­joining the Armed Forces. She looked into the idea of a ­military scholarship when she was 18.I was all for that, but in the end she decided upon ­something else.There is an idea that these games are just for boys, but girls want to be involved as well.Warfare is part of our genetic make up.It has been like this since the time of hunter-gatherers who had to defend their food sources — first their hunting grounds then later, when we became farmers, our lands.The reason we have been so successful as a species is the ability to defend ­ourselves.Back in medieval times kids would play with wooden swords and it was once ­obligatory for all males aged over 14 to practise the longbow on Sundays.We all go “ahhh” when we see puppies or kittens tussling and rolling about with their siblings, but what they are doing is learning to defend themselves.The idea that stopping any gameplay which involves ­fighting is going to change hundreds of thousands of years of human development is ­nonsensical.The complaint that toy weapons fuel a chaotic atmosphere in our nurseries is nothing more than a sign of laziness among the employers and employees.They are taking the easy route by simply banning lively games. This is more about making life easier for the staff than it is about helping our kids. They just want the ­children sitting there passively, possibly watching television or playing on a tablet.That is not what young ­children are about. They have a huge amount of energy to burn, and it is wrong to corral them into increasingly sedate life-styles.We have enough problems with obesity without demanding the next generation sit quietly all day long.The truth is that children will use up calories when they run around pretending to be in Star Wars or The Incredibles.The staff shouldn’t be bringing their own political ideas into the playground. They shouldn’t be making the children conform to what they think. Instead they should be focusing on ­fostering the imaginations of children by allowing them to explore these ideas.Steve Jobs, who helped to bring the iPhone and the iPad to the world, was inspired by Star Trek, and there were quite a few people getting zapped on that.By allowing children to play cops and robbers or pirates or cowboys or superheroes they are developing storytelling skills which will be vital in their ­education.Do we want them to come to read ­William Shakespeare with no prior ­knowledge of what conflict is?Any writer will tell you great storytelling needs drama and to have drama you need conflict.Going back as far as Greek literature there was greed, envy and jealousy underpinning the narrative. These nurseries fail to recognise the quality of the gameplay generated by young minds.They should be harnessing the roleplay and getting involved. The staff could ask why one person is always the baddie and what the kids enjoy about being the goodie.Superhero movies always contain a ­positive moral tale that children can learn from. There is good, there is evil, there is a recognition that someone has acted wrongly and they explore ways to improve our behaviour.When kids play cops and robbers, it is the police who win.The baddie always gets their comeuppance and the cops are the smarter ones.It’s not about arming our children with guns, it’s about arming them with the tools they need to be more creative.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet targeting struggling families is political cowardice. The international aid budget is now so vast that even the Secretary of State in charge cannot justify it.Cut it by two-thirds to fund the NHS.

I want to apologise for that and for misleading you.But she doubled down on claims that the NAO had failed to take into account all of the changes the Department had made before they released that report.In the letter Sir Amyas Morse also wrote: Your department confirmed this to me in writing on 6 June and we then reached final agreement on the report by 8 June.Ms Mcvey said that the impact of advances in cash for those on Universal Credit and the removal of waiting days for payments were still being felt and cannot have fully been taken into account by the NAO report.The letter claimed Sir Amyas had asked her for meetings but has yet to have secured one. The DWP said its working on getting a date secured.Green MP Caroline Lucas today said she was lying and should resign from her position.She tweeted: Things have reached a new low when the National Audit Office accuses a Cabinet Minister of lying. #UniversalCredit is failing, and if Esther McVey is not up to the job of sorting it out – as seems to be the case – then she has to go.And Labours Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said she could consider her position.It comes after the NAO gave a damning report into Universal Credit, revealing just how its failing.The new welfare scheme is designed to wrap a number of benefits into a single monthly payment, and replace payments like child tax credit, housing benefit and jobseekers allowance.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the payments if youre part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £348 if youre single, £464 if youre part of a couple or £812 if you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, even if you stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Payments if your payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.The report said that a fifth of claimants payments are delayed, it costs more to run, is taking six years longer than planned to roll out, and is driving people to food banks.But the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions claimed that Universal Credit IS working.In a statement in the Commons in response to the report she dismissed the study, and said it was a unique example of great British innovation.Former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan-Smith announced the introduction of a Universal Credit in 2010 designed to simplify the benefits system and improve work incentives - making it the landmark policy of his time in government.He backed his successor last week, saying the NAO report was a shoddy piece of work.The Department for Work and Pensions has been approached for comment.But the upfront payment is a loan which means youll have to pay it back.The repayments will be automatically deducted from your Universal Credit payments after youve taken the loan.You should ask for the advance if you dont think youll have enough money to live on between when you apply and when youll get your first payment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418038157.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"roman skeletons lincoln take away viking house","story":"It’s though they are part of the same burial ground where 23 skeletons were unearthed in a 2015 dig.One of the graves contained a burial pot which would have been filled with a drink to take to the afterlife.They were unearthed at the former site of the Taste Of Marrakesh restaurant in the city centre where a development of 400 student flats is to be built.Among the discoveries were some from the Medieval era - including cellars, wells and a bone ice skate.Network Archaeology and city archaeologist Alastair Macintosh have spent a month on the dig in collaboration with developer Jackson \u0026amp Jackson.Claire Lingard, a director of Network Archaeology, said: There are three burials which are all believed to be male.Logic dictates they were buried in the same burial ground as the earlier finds of 23 skeletons.One is buried with a votive pot which we think is late fourth century and that enables us to date the burial.The pot would have been filled with a drink to take to the afterlife and thats a ritual that was common in the Roman period.”She added: The medieval finds are really fascinating.I like the skate made from animal bone - you can imagine the owner skating on the Brayford.”Work is now ongoing to catalogue, date and archive the finds. It comes after the remains of King Richard III were discovered under a car park in Leicester in 2012.Richard Buckley, lead archaeologist at the University of Leicester, said tests on the full remains proved they were the king’s “beyond reasonable doubt”.Richard III’s demise was dramatised by Shakespeare, who had the king calling out “a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse” before he was killed on battlefield."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000417805262.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"asda bans shopper every uk store","story":"Mulkh Chumber, 53, went to buy ten bottles of Comfort Creations after the supermarkets advert in The Sun promised it for £1 a bottle instead of £3.Mr Chumber was stunned when he got to the checkout and was told it really cost £2 a bottle.He says staff called the police on him because he refused to leave without his bargain laundry products.Cops said they will take no action - but Asda said he is not allowed in any store in the whole of Britain, claiming he was abusive.Mr Chumber, a newsagent of Basford, Staffs, said: “Asda security staff handed me a letter saying I am banned from every single Asda in the UK and I was shocked. It is not fair.“If something is advertised at a certain price then you should give it to the customer at that price.I used to go to Asda three or four times a week and have never had any problems before.I can do without them and go to Morrisons instead.”He said after the wrong price came up at the checkout he went to the customer service desk where staff said again the fabric softener was £2.He said: I showed her the advert, which stated they were £1, and she said it was subject to availability, even though the shelves were full.“Then I was told it was selected stores only. But they could not tell me where the offer was available, and I was told I would have to put them back.“I said I didn’t go to the store to waste my time putting the items in the trolley and then putting them back and then Ive wasted petrol going to the store and back.The Asda staff called security and they told me they would call the police if I did not leave.I did not leave, the police arrived and I spent half an hour with them explaining the situation.Staffordshire police confirmed they were called to Wolstanton Retail Park on June 15.The force said: We were called to reports of a man being abusive to staff. The man, in his 50s, was spoken to by officers at the supermarket.Asda said: “We would have honoured the advertised deal, but do not tolerate abusive behaviour towards colleagues.”Last month shopper Andrew Gregory was banned from a nearby Asda in Tunstall after he complained about the toilets.In 2016 mum-of-two Natasha Hamlin was banned from all UK Asda stores, meaning she could not spend a £142 voucher she was given as a refund moments earlier."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000417804309.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"roger curry simon hayes granny dumping dementia hereford","story":"Roger Curry, 76, and no ID was unable to remember his name or personal details when he was discovered outside a bus station in Hereford in November 2015.The case baffled police and sparked a global appeal to find out who Mr Curry was and how he came to be in Britain.Simon Hayes, 52, of Taunton, Somerset, appeared at Worcester Crown Court on Tuesday in connection with the case.He is accused of helping Mr Currys son Kevin Curry to intentionally abandon the OAP.Hayes is charged with one count of fraud, one of perverting the course of justice and two counts of possessing fake letters and references for the use in fraud.In court yesterday Hayes, wearing a white T-shirt and jeans, denied the charges. He will stand trial next April.Prosecutor Simon Davis said: The defendant and [Rogers son] Kevin Curry effectively dumped Roger Curry in Hereford city centre knowing full well they just left him there.The motive was to put him into care - its known as granny dumping.Having left Roger Curry there, the defendant made contact with the police.

Park Infant School in Plymouth, Devon, sent a newsletter to parents letting them know pupils were not allowed to bring sun cream into school.It instead urged parents to use “once a day” lotion on their kids – despite Cancer Research UK advising people to re-apply cream regularly.Former RAF office Mark Jones claims his eldest daughter Poppy, seven, was told to put away her sun cream when she got it out at lunchtime.Mark, 41, also dad to five-year-old pupil Alice, said the “ridiculous” and “bonkers” decision is putting kids at risk of sunburn as temperatures soar.Hyde Park Infant School have put the ban down to concerns over the chemicals in sun cream and its storage.The Royal Navy Reserves officer, from Plymouth, said: It’s absolutely bonkers that the girls can’t take sun cream into school.“Lots of sun creams rub off easily onto the kid’s uniforms which means when they go out at lunch time they’re no longer protected.“These ‘once-a-day’ creams haven’t been proven to work and even the Cancer Research UK website says that cream must be re-applied regularly in order to maintain adequate protection.”Mark has now set up a petition calling on the school’s board of governors and head teacher to change their minds.He claims when wife Nicola 39, contacted Elizabeth Hill, the school’s headteacher, she was told there were concerns over the chemicals contained in the cream which could potentially cause harm.Taking his concerns to the board of governors, Mark claims he was later informed the reason the sun cream wasn’t allowed in school was due to storage space.Mark is also confused Hyde Park Junior School – which sits on the same campus and has the same board of governors – does allow its pupils to bring in sunscreen.Newsletters on Hyde Park Infant School’s website state: “Please apply sun cream to exposed parts of your child’s body that will last the day.“Please apply any sun cream before school as it cannot be applied in school or brought to school.”Mark said: “The fact that the head teacher and the board of governors couldn’t give me the same reason just didn’t add up.“They couldn’t provide a plausible reason for not allowing cream in the classroom.“I understand that they have rules about not being allowed to apply sun cream to pupils because of safeguarding, but I want my children to be able to apply it to themselves, so why can’t they do this?”Mark has since made an official complaint and his petition has already been signed more than 100 times.In a statement, head teacher Ms Hill said: “Mr Jones has made an official complaint to the school which is at ‘stage 3’.“I am unable to make a comment during this process.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418096973.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eating a handful of nuts a day significantly improves fertility

the odds of becoming a father.Nuts are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, which are known to benefit sperm.The findings come from tests by Spanish researchers on 119 healthy young men.They ate a Western diet but half were given a 60g mix of almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts.After 14 weeks, the nut group had a 16 per cent higher sperm count.Its swimming ability was six per cent better and

Do you be extremely reasonable and adjust, or do you face down the EU?“They will come to us eventually, we just need to hold our nerve.”At the same time, Mrs May mounted her own battle against time to try to persuade senior Cabinet ministers to side with her during a make or break Cabinet showdown at Chequers tomorrow.The PM called in Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson yesterday afternoon – seen as two key swing votes around her bitterly divided top table.She argued that her plan to align with Brussels rules on goods and collect EU customs tariffs in order to keep borders with Europe free flowing will only affect 4% of all UK trade, and crucially not stop Britain from pursuing an independent trade policy after Brexit.Mr Davis was coordinating a “ring round” of Brexiteer Cabinet Ministers to make sure they were “all on the same page”.An ally said the ministers would “be ready at Chequers to show very simply where promises made in the PM’s speeches were crossed by the new proposals”. The Brexit Secretary is working closely with Boris Johnson, with both confident that Mr Javid was also still opposed to collecting customs on behalf of the EU – a new system dubbed the Facilitated Customs Arrangement.Ardent backbench Leaver Andrea Jenkyns called on the Brexiteer Cabinet ministers to “show their steel” and block the blueprint, as she ominously warned that Mrs May could be ousted, saying: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs who keep their promises”.Jacob Rees-Mogg led an angry deputation of 40 anti-EU Tory MPs from the eurosceptic European Reform Group to protest at Chief Whip Julian Smith yesterday morning.Mr Smith was told during the stormy meeting that the Tories will be “toast if we welch on Brexit”. Former Leave campaign boss Michael Gove insisted it was for the full Cabinet to decide whether her plan will go forward, in a veiled hint they could overrule the PM.The Environment Secretary – who angrily ripped up a paper on her customs plan in No10 last week – would also not rule out Cabinet resignations, equivocally saying only when he was asked: “I don’t think so”.Another minister predicted there would be resignations after the day-long Chequers showdown.The former Remain backing minister told The Sun: “The time has come to chose.“She cannot take everyone with her any more, so someone is going to walk”.As tensions spiralled on all sides of the Tory party, Business Minister Richard Harrington insisted that no deal “would be completely disastrous for business” – deviating from the Government’s line.Ministers such as Boris and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt who attack firms for going public with their worries “don’t really understand how business works,” Mr Harrington added.GOT a story?

Now he may have saved these kids’ lives.“The funny thing is that at first the authorities didn’t want to pay attention to him.“But Vern convinced them and now they consider him as some kind of magician.”The practice is common in Thailand to bring good luck on occasions such as New Year.Pilgrims to the site in Chiang Rai province also took fruit and flowers.In a picture posted on Twitter, Thai navy divers could be seen taking a garland of banana leaves to the cave.Thailand is a famously superstitious country.Getting a hair cut on a Wednesday is considered bad luck, while bees and toads are good omens.The No 9 is lucky, but Thais are said to be reconsidering the superstition against the No 13, with 12 boys and their coach stuck in the cave.GOT a story?

Unsurprisingly, Labour MPs defended their party leader, with Wigan MP Lisa Nandy insisting Mr Corbyn was \"so right\" to focus on buses, adding that they are \"used by far more people than trains and have been among the many casualties of Tory austerity\".Indeed, official Department for Transport figures show there were 4.44 billion local bus passenger journeys in England in the year ending March 2017.By contrast, there were 1.7 billion rail passenger journeys over the same period, with most rail journeys made in London and the South East.Meanwhile, Labour\u0027s shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald posted on Twitter: \"That Tory MPs were cackling with laughter as Jeremy Corbyn detailed the extent of the crisis in bus services demonstrates how little they care for buses and those who rely on them.\" Coinciding with Mr Corbyn\u0027s questioning at PMQs and Catch The Bus Week, Labour also released a new analysis of government figures, which they claimed showed bus passenger numbers have \"collapsed\" in the North and the Midlands since 2010.As \u0027s Andrew Sparrow noted, a study of last year\u0027s general election from the Hansard Society, titled Britain Votes 2017, showed the single factor that most seems to drive people towards voting Labour in English and Welsh constituencies is not having a car.Perhaps enjoying the break from discussing Brexit or attempting to deal with cabinet divisions, Mrs May defended the government from Mr Corbyn\u0027s attacks.She said: \"What we are seeing across the country is that, as people\u0027s working habits are changing, there is less usage of buses, but we are working with local authorities on this.\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-samara-stadium_4353531.jpg?20180704200115 ","title":"got world cup fever how to get to samara to watch the game on saturday","story":"The embassy says it can arrange flights, accommodation and insurance but does not say anything about tickets.The arrangement applies to anyone who does not already have a ticket - which automatically provides holders the right to a Fan ID.The Fan ID acts as a entry and exit visa to Russia, enabling fans to travel to the country until 15 July and stay until 25 July.To obtain one, a traveller must hold a match ticket, even if they don\u0027t actually intend on attending the game. The UK Foreign Office told Sky News that the process of applying for a Fan ID once a match ticket has been purchased is quick and an electronic version is suitable to travel on. A physical version can be picked up in Russia.Travellers also must have a passport valid for the duration of their trip.The Foreign Office website advises that if travelling on a British passport issued since January 2017, it must be signed with a black pen before anyone travels as some British nationals who haven\u0027t signed theirs have been denied entry into Russia.But the whole package is unlikely to be cheap.

It\u0027ll set you back around \u0026#163665. I don\u0027t want to fly, how else can I get there?The drive from London takes an estimated 46 hours and needs you to cover almost 2,500 miles (4,000km).

Thai authorities are looking at several possibilities depending on the water levels inside the caves and the weather, she added.Much work has gone into stemming the flow of water into the cave and pumping out the water that is already there, in the hope the boys may not need to dive and if they do, it will be for a shorter distance.Chongklai Voraphongston, deputy director-general of the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, said Huai Nam Dan stream, which runs into the caves, has been completely blocked. The Huai Makok stream meanwhile, which is located to the south of cave and flows into it, has been diverted, using six 200-meter-long (656ft) pipes.Several natural shafts, which allow water to pour into the cave system from above, are being plugged.Major General Bancha Duriyaphan said the volume of water draining from the cave had fallen and was expected to decrease further provided there is no rainfall. The governor of Chiang Rai province said the extraction of the football team and their coach would depend on their physical condition.Mr Osatanakorn said that a new cave, suspected to be connected to the area where the group are located, has been discovered and was being explored.Video footage released overnight showed the group appearing to be in reasonably good health, with a team of Thai navy SEALs treating them for minor injuries on their feet as the boys smiled and made gestures to say \"hello\".One of the boys and the 25-year-old coach are said to be suffering from \"medium\" health problems, but they have all been provided with reflective blankets to keep them warm and further supplies of food. A team of British cave divers, two of whom were the first to locate the footballers, are continuing to help move food and equipment to the place where the team are waiting, which is known locally as Pattaya Beach.The boys are being looked after by seven navy SEALs, including medics, who are staying with them inside the cave.Two of the boys are wearing English football shirts - one the red away kit of the national side and the other a Chelsea top.

Labour is already committed to a \u0026pound10 minimum wage by 2020 and the latest research for the Unite union found that the rise for workers aged 18-plus would boost public coffers by \u0026pound5.6 billion a year. Workers in hospitality and retail, where low pay is rife, would be the biggest winners from the increase, according to the research conducted by an economic think-tank. A \u0026pound10 minimum wage would boost net income by more than \u0026pound1,300 a year and would benefit 5.2m female workers and three out of four young workers aged 18 to 20. An ‘intermediate’ increase to \u0026pound9 an hour for workers aged 25 and over, \u0026pound8.70 for those aged 21-24 and \u0026pound8 for 18-20-year-olds would benefit 6.25m workers. The current full National Minimum Wage rate is \u0026pound7.83 per hour for workers aged 25 and over.  The research comes ahead of today’s speech by Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell at Unite’s policy conference in Brighton. Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary, said: “Workers’ wallets are running on empty and incomes are being squeezed by cuts to in-work benefits and the government’s chaotic introduction of Universal Credit. “There is something desperately wrong with our economy when 60 per cent of people in poverty are living in working households and over one million food parcels are handed out each year. “As in-work poverty grows, big business is benefitting from corporate welfare which is subsidising low pay across the economy in the form of in-work benefits. “Increasing the minimum wage and national living wage to \u0026pound10 per hour would be a huge boost for young workers and help end poverty pay rates that hospitality workers have to endure. “It would be a virtuous circle helping ease the squeeze on incomes, while increasing the public finances through greater tax revenues and reduced spending on in-work benefits. “A \u0026pound10 per hour minimum wage would mean extra money in people’s pockets which would be spent in communities and on high streets across the UK. It would help breathe life into a flagging economy and make work pay.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tory minister admits no deal","story":"NewsTory minister admits no-deal Brexit would be \u0027complete disaster\u0027 as tensions mount ahead of Chequers summitThe Prime Minister has always insisted “no deal is better than a bad deal”\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter22:25, 4 JUL 2018Updated22:31, 4 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA NO-deal Brexit would be “completely disastrous for business in this country” a minister has admitted, in a fresh blow to Theresa May’s authority. The Prime Minister has always insisted “no deal is better than a bad deal”. But, referring to fears raised by car giant BMW, Business Minister Richard Harrington said: “It’s very hard to see the advantage to businesses like that of us crashing out of the European Union.” No 10 insisted: “We are working hard to secure a good deal on behalf of the British people.” Mrs May is reportedly planning the “softest possible Brexit” ahead of tomorrow’s crunch Cabinet showdown at Chequers.  The beleaguered PM hopes to forge unity among her top team behind her latest customs blueprint. Bidding to quell a Leavers’ revolt, she told the Commons yesterday: “The Brexit that this Government will be delivering and is working to deliver is a Brexit that ensures that we are out of the customs union, we are out of the single market, we are out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, we are out of the Common Agricultural Policy, we are out of the Common Fisheries Policy, we bring an end to free movement, we take control of our borders, we have an independent trade policy and that we are also able to have a good trade arrangement with the European Union, protecting jobs and prosperity of the future.”  More than 40 Eurosceptic Tories met Chief Whip Julian Smith to warn against a soft Brexit. Former Cabinet Minister Owen Paterson said: “We cannot deliver any of the economic benefits of Brexit without leaving the customs union cleanly and completely, freeing ourselves to forge our own trade relationships with friends and allies across the world and committing to the principles of free trade. “The Conservative manifesto at the last general election - which secured the most votes of any party since 1992 - was unambiguously clear: ‘As we leave the European Union, we will no longer be members of the single market or customs union’. “For the good of every citizen in the country, that promise must now be delivered.” Leading Leaver MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: “I won’t be reassured until I know the details of what comes out on Friday, one way or the other.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tube posters telling commuters not","story":"NewsTube posters telling commuters not to grope women could help stop sexual harassment, says ministerVictoria Atkins believed posters on the transport network could help curb sexual harassment suffered in the rush-hour.\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor20:05, 4 JUL 2018NewsMinister Victoria Atkins believe (Image: Getty Images Europe)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTube bosses could wage an ad campaign telling commuters not to grope women passengers, a Government minister suggested today. Victoria Atkins believed posters on the transport network could help curb sexual harassment suffered in the rush-hour. Some travellers see their rail journeys as an opportunity to touch up women, the Minister for Women said. “We know sadly it is a place where people seem to think it’s an opportunity to behave disgustingly,” she told MPs. Ms Atkins believed an advertising drive could be “very powerful”. “Having a campaign on the Tube carriages about, ‘Please don’t think this gives you the right to grab someone’ - that could be very effective because you are all standing up, pressed together, looking at the advert - you can’t avoid it,” she told the Commons Women and Equalities Committee. “I’d be interested in a targeted campaign if the evidence was that would be a good way to spend taxpayers’ money.” Giving evidence on how to tackle sexual harassment of women and girls, she hit out at how females are portrayed in music videos. “Look at how women are depicted in some music videos - it is offensive actually,” she said.  “How we persuade companies that produce those videos to work towards reducing or stopping that, that is a huge piece of work and it has to come from society as much as government.” Research has been commissioned into the impact of online porn on attitudes to women and girls, she told MPs. “Pornography online has exploded exponentially in the last decade and I think that is presenting us with very worrying challenges as to how women are viewed in relationships, in healthy relationships, and what boys expect of them, and what girls expect of themselves.” Outlining a “heartbreaking example”, she told how one boy being helped by a charity “said to his youth worker that he didn’t realise that girls weren’t supposed to cry during sex”. Ms Atkins added: “Where he has learnt that from? We know online pornography played a very, very big role. “People viewing that sort of pornography - why are they doing that? “How does that then influence their treatment of their loved ones, their girlfriends, their wives, their daughters?” Labour MP Jess Phillips asked what would happen if a schoolgirl was targeted by a motorist shouting “nice t**s”. She said: “Do you feel confident that if a 16-year-old girl waiting at a bus stop wearing her school uniform and somebody drives past and shouts that she’s got nice t**s, that she would have a legal or criminal sanction at her disposal?” "},{"url":null,"title":"best tents buy summer best","story":"AdvertorialThe best tents to buy this summer and the best deals - whether you\u0027re going to a festival or on a family holidayHere are the best bargains around if you\u0027re looking to snap up a new tent\u0026nbspShareByDave Masters09:58, 4 JUL 2018Updated13:00, 4 JUL 2018Advertorial\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSummer is the perfect time to pitch up a tent and explore the great outdoors.

Greg and Maria Toole together attacked 60-year-old Dorothy Matthews following the senseless argument about the tray being taken away from an engagement party. Maria, 32, was described as being completely out of control when she dragged Miss Matthews from a taxi in front of her three grandchildren and repeatedly punched her. Her 33-year-old husband Greg then began kicking the grandmother as she lay on the ground of a working men\u0027s club car park in Snodland, Kent. Miss Matthews described how she thought she was going to die as she heard her body cracking.  She told a court all she could do was curl up in a ball and said she thought she would never be able to get up. Greg and Maria Toole, who have six children, acted together in a most unpleasant attack on Miss Matthews, a judge said. Self-emoloyed builder Greg, who has previous convictions for violence, joined in after shouting they should not start on his wife, who gave birth to her sixth child while awaiting trial. Miss Matthews suffered a fractured sternum and three broken neck vertebrae in the violent onslaught, dubbed a sandwich tray war by Judge Adele Williams. It occurred after Miss Matthews\u0027s daughter-in-law helped herself to the plastic sandwich platters as they left the celebrations on February 18 last year. Described in court as being a trial with aspects of the soap opera about it, Miss Matthews was first hit up to 10 times by Maria Toole, whose youngest child is just 15 weeks old. The gran was then kicked and stamped on by Greg. I heard cracks in my body, I could hear my body cracking inside, and then I felt a deep crack. I was in agony, said Miss Matthews. It (the attack) felt like forever. I didn\u0027t think it would end. I thought I was dying. I thought I would never be able to get up and I felt I would die on that spot.  The Tooles, of Snodland, denied inflicting grievous bodily harm but were unanimously convicted by a jury on Friday June 29. Sentencing them today at Maidstone Crown Court in Kent, Judge Adele Williams said jail was inevitable despite the impact on their children. This was a most unpleasant attack upon a woman older than each of you. There was a senseless argument about sandwich trays and you, Maria Toole, began to exchange verbal abuse. You were very drunk and angry and pursued them to the taxi, she told them. It was a joint attack and each of you is equally culpable and responsible. Dorothy Matthews sustained serious injuries and I have heard a victim personal statement from her which makes clear the pain, suffering and distress that she has suffered. She has, not surprisingly, found this to be a deeply traumatic experience and experiences ongoing physical problems. It has also affected her psychologically. She has lost confidence and fears for her future. I\u0027m satisfied proper arrangements have been made for the care of your children but I do not underestimate the effect on the children of separation from both parents. The judge added: You, Maria Toole, were completely out of control. You started the violence. CCTV showed how you ran after them and had to be pulled away and prevented from returning to continue the attack. You, Greg Toole, used your foot to inflict injury by kicking and stamping on your victim. It was a sustained attack, a shod foot was used and two of you were involved. Also, the victim\u0027s grandchildren were present in the taxi.  The court was told the Tooles\u0027 children, three of whom are under school age, will be cared for in their family home by an aunt and their grandmother. However, Judge Williams remarked it would be an advantageous arrangement if Maria and the youngest child were reunited in a mother and baby unit. Miss Matthews, known as Dot, was leaving Snodland Working Men\u0027s Club with her family when she was attacked at about 11.30pm. Just seconds earlier her daughter\u0027s partner, Chelsea Farinaro, had been confronted about leaving with the sandwich servers and so they were returned. Prosecutor Iestyn Morgan said at the start of the trial on June 26: This is a sad case, as most cases are, with aspects of the soap opera about it because this occurred after an engagement party where everything had gone well throughout the evening. Then, at the very end, an argument starts over a plate or tray of sandwiches being taken from the party. That argument ends up with a 60-year-old lady in hospital with a fracture to her sternum and several fractures to her neck. Miss Matthews spent two weeks in hospital recovering from her injuries, needed full-time care for several weeks after her discharge, and was off work for three months. In a statement to the court, the one-time keen walker said: I feel like I want to put a sign around my neck saying \u0027Fragile\u0027. One thing the assault has taught me is that you don\u0027t know what is ahead of you. I went out for the evening to what was considered a safe place. I am now nervous about being out and about and fear for my future. I don\u0027t want this to turn me into an old lady. I\u0027m 60 years old and have always considered myself to be young at heart. But since this has happened I feel my age. I am angry this has happened and I am upset my grandchildren were there and this will be in their memories. I cannot believe they did this in front of my grandchildren. It is despicable.

She was the most amazing and beautiful little girl that there could ever be. The distraught mum-to-five, of Croydon, south London, added: My heart is just broken that she has been taken away from me, I would give anything to get her back. Everyone that saw her smile fell in love with her. To know that we are never going to see that smile again has just broken us.  I was sat outside [on Tuesday] and a white feather flew down, I thought it was an angel coming to look after her, not take her away. But she was gone that night. She started going cold. I thought if I just put my body on her and warmed her up she will come back to us, but it didn’t work. I can’t bear the thought of not seeing her smile again.

Elsie Allcock was born in an upstairs bedroom of the two-bed home and has no plans to leave. She grew up there with her four older siblings and parents, who rented the property. Elsie then bought it in 1960 for \u0026pound250 with the help of a council loan, following her parents’ deaths. Recalling the Hall family’s early days at the house in Nottinghamshire, she said: “My mother and father came to live in Huthwaite in 1900 when my sister Emma was two years old.  “My father was a coal miner at Blackwell Colliery. My mother was a hard-working woman. She did washing five days a week for us and other people. “She had no washing machine, just a tub to boil clothes in. It was very hard work. “My sister Mary and I would take the baskets of washing back to the customers all ironed and ready to wear. All for half a crown that is two shillings and sixpence.” The mum of two was born in June 1918, towards the end of the First World War.  Back then, the house was lit and heated using paraffin oil lamps and candles. The family had an outdoor toilet in the 12ft x 8ft garden, which is still used to this day. Elsie, who turned 100 last Thursday, went on: “When I was eight years old in 1926 the coal miners were on strike and the men were off work for weeks, with no money coming in. “In those days you had to have coal to get hot water. We had to put pennies in the gas meter. Weeks went by. No work. No money. No coal.” Growing up in the house with a big family also meant space was a challenge. At bedtime Elsie often found herself topping and tailing with her older siblings.  She left school aged 14 and stayed at home to look after the family following the death of her mum Eliza in 1932. Her dad Mark died 17 years later. And apart from a one-month stay in hospital in the 1960s, Elsie has lived in the house ever since, raising her sons there with husband Bill Allcock.

Smiley Alesha, six, was reported missing from her grandmother Angela King\u0027s home on the Isle of Bute, Scotland, on Monday morning.  Her body was found less than three hours later in woodland on the site of a former hotel in Rothesay by a member of the public. This morning, a team of police vans were seen arriving outside Ms King\u0027s property, where Alesha had been staying while on holiday.  Officers entered the Ardbeg Road home, near Rothesay, shortly after 11am and could be seen searching the gardens surrounding it.  Police tape has also been put up around the building, while tributes have been laid by stunned locals, the Daily Record reports.  Cops had yesterday seized a vehicle on the island as part of their investigation into the death of friendly and popular Alesha. The schoolgirl, from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, was a few days into a three-week break to visit family when she disappeared. She was reported missing at 6.25am on Monday, with her body discovered in woodland at about 9am.  Last night, following the results of a post-mortem examination, police confirmed that they were treating the schoolgirl\u0027s death as murder. Cops have warned islanders to be vigilant about the safety of their children and the security of their homes as investigations continue. Meanwhile, locals have spoken of their shock at the death of Alesha. Reverend Owain Jones has opened his United Church of Bute in Rothesay to allow people to visit at any time. He said: We\u0027re all absolutely staggered, we have no words for this and it\u0027s beyond any power of words to express. We\u0027re all just really sitting in a kind of shared stunned silence just trying to uphold each other.  Bute is one of these places that is incredibly safe, you take all sorts of things for granted here and don\u0027t panic if you forget to lock the house or whatever. It\u0027s not a remote island in the classic sense - it\u0027s only 90 minutes to Glasgow - but even so it is an island and we all know each other at least by sight, and it\u0027s an extremely safe place and there is no context for this. We wondered what we could do as a church by way of a response and we have opened the church, after the news overnight, to people of all faiths and none to just come and sit and use the space as is helpful to them. Meanwhile, Detective Superintendent Stuart Houston said Alesha\u0027s family were utterly devastated at her death and appealed for anyone with information to come forward.  He is still keen to speak to people who were involved in the search for the missing girl that was conducted early on Monday. He added: Alesha had lots of friends who will no doubt find it very difficult to comprehend why they will never see their friend again. For such a young girl to have her life taken away is incomprehensible. Earlier yesterday, Alesha\u0027s devastated mum Georgina Lochrane, 23, whom she lived with, sobbed uncontrollably as police escorted her to see tributes that had been laid for her daughter outside the flat. She placed a school photograph of her little girl beside the flowers. It is understood that Georgina carried out a formal identification of her daughter\u0027s body after it was taken to the mainland.  Alesha’s dad Robert MacPhail, who is estranged from Georgina, also went to see the tributes to his daughter yesterday. He was supported by his girlfriend, Tonii Mclachlan. Alesha was a pupil at Chapelside Primary School in Airdrie, where the headteacher said she would be greatly missed. Wendy Davie said: “Alesha started with us at Chapelside Primary in August 2016 and had just finished primary two. “She loved being at school and enjoyed all aspects of literacy, in particular writing. She was such a perfectionist in her handwriting and was very proud of her work.

He’s barred the vehicle gate too, so the owners have to trudge to the nearest village and carry back bottled water for drinking and washing. The locked gate also means that there’s no access for the emergency services. The dispute at the site at Claverley, Shropshire, began after a company called Sought After Location Limited bought the land and an adjacent caravan park. The chalet owners claim that they’re being strong-armed into leaving by company director William Flannigan, 28. Brian and Carrianne Byrne renovated their chalet after buying it last year. “He wants us to sign a holiday site licence, which he could revoke at any time and force us out,” Brian said. Carrianne added: “We have to climb over the stile when we bring back bottled water. “We use rain water to fill the toilet cistern. We can’t really shower.” The pair spent \u0026pound25,000 sprucing up their chalet with a new bathroom, kitchen and carpets. “It’s really nice but we can’t move it, it would fall apart if we tried,” said Carrianne.  Another couple, June and David Northcote, bought their chalet in 2000 and say that they were promised a 99-year lease by the previous land owner. “William Flannigan visited me and promised the same lease, shook my hand and promised to put details in writing, but never did,” says June. “They’ve told us to sign the new licence or take our bungalows away. We cannot move them, they are permanent structures with planning permission.” She added that there had been no site maintenance this year and now the dry overgrown grass was a fire waiting to happen so close to the wooden bungalows.  Another owner, Jo Finzi, bought her chalet 10 years ago and says: “Mr Flannigan promised me an offer for my chalet but never confirmed any price other than saying ‘It won’t be what you paid for it’.” William Flannigan responded through his lawyer Lewis Griffiths of Excello Law, who says that the owners have no legal right to remain. “They are not residents, they never have been, they never will be and they have never lived permanently on the park,” he said.  “Mr Northcote in particular keeps blarting on about ‘I was promised this, I was promised that’, well, you can’t sue on a promise. “If I say I’ll clean your car and then don’t do it, you can’t sue me. “The chalet part of the site does have planning permission for permanent residential use, but that’s nothing to do with the people who own the chalets and everything to do with the person who owns the land, which is now my client.”  Griffiths says the owners only have themselves to blame for not taking legal advice when buying the properties. “Why would you spend a load of money on something without securing your position. Did you not speak to your solicitor?” he demanded. “They just don’t seem to grasp the fact that they’ve got no security of tenure.” Meanwhile, he says, the water is staying off until the new site licences are signed. “They are not in a position to negotiate,” Griffiths adds. “You’ve got to have something setting out the legal basis between the landowner and the person occupying the land. They don’t seem to grasp that.  “It may have been that the previous owner was a bit laissez-faire and didn’t renew the licences every year but I don’t care about that and neither does my client. We own the land now and not the previous owner.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mother explains chooses breastfeed two","story":"NewsMother explains why she chooses to breastfeed her two year old - even when sitting on toiletBecky Vieira, 42, said she receives regular criticism from online trolls after posting about her extended breastfeeding of her son, Archer - and has even been him as he now has teeth\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAlyce Collins13:34, 4 JUL 2018Updated13:37, 4 JUL 2018NewsWriter and stay-at-home mum, Becky Vieira, 42 (Image: Becky Vieira)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mother has explained why she still breastfeeds her two-year-old despite being bitten by a son who now has teeth. Writer and stay-at-home mum, Becky Vieira, 42, has perfected her technique so well she now feeds son Archer while she\u0027s cooking and even while she\u0027s on the toilet. The mum, from San Francisco, USA, has become an Instagram heroine for other mums after posting about her extended breastfeeding of her son, Archer, 22 months. But not everyone agrees with her decision - and she has been targeted by online trolls who have told her she\u0027s freak and even contacted by men who find it sexual and send her graphic photos.  Becky was overjoyed when her wish of becoming a mother was finally answered at the age of 40, but with this came so many unanswered questions and an overwhelming struggle to get everything done \u0027right\u0027 by society\u0027s eyes. Becky has been breastfeeding Archer for 22 months, and she shows no sign of weaning him off her milk, despite the criticism she faces on a regular basis. Mums are told that we must breastfeed our babies, but it\u0027s considered wrong if we breastfeed for more than a year or so, Becky said. I breastfed my son at first because I knew it was good for him, but it was painful and awkward at first.  It was uncomfortable initially, it felt like someone rubbed sandpaper on my nipple and put it into a pencil sharpener. But I saw how healthy he was and how he was growing. Like everyone tells you, it gets better with time, patience and practice. Archer was diagnosed with acid reflux, so his paediatrician was worried formula would aggravate his situation. So originally, I just wanted to get my son passed his reflux but look at us now! We take it day by day, and as long as it works for both of us we\u0027ll continue to breastfeed. But it is getting more uncomfortable as he gets older and bigger now.  In many ways it\u0027s easier because we\u0027ve been doing it for so long that we\u0027ve perfected things. I can do other things while I breastfeed, like vacuuming or go to the toilet. But he will grab my breasts which isn\u0027t fun. Some people say they could never breastfeed a child with teeth and he has bitten me a handful of times if he\u0027s been falling asleep. Archer started eating solid food at the age of six months, but he still has breast milk every day on top of this. Usually, Archer will be breastfed in the morning and then have two feedings later in the day. Many people believe there are lots of benefits to extended breastfeeding, and Becky has even had her breast milk analysed for its nutritional value which showed it was still full of vitamins and healthy fats.  Other mums have said I made them feel less alone and helped normalise extended breastfeeding, Becky explained. Many mums who were unable to breastfeed are incredibly supportive and encourage me to continue. I\u0027ve had mums tell me how much they miss it themselves and wish me well it\u0027s amazing, it feels like a true community. Of course, there are trolls who offer unsolicited opinions and tell me I\u0027m wrong for nursing still and that I\u0027m enabling bad behaviour on my son\u0027s part. There are even some men who find it sexual and send me graphic photos. I\u0027ve had people call me a \u0027freak\u0027 and had men say it\u0027s \u0027sexy\u0027 and that my son is \u0027lucky\u0027. It\u0027s funny, with all the mums in the world you\u0027d think we\u0027d be more supportive and open about things. There\u0027s still pressure to present an image that everything is neat and tidy at all times.

Forecasters say there is a risk of showers of a thundery nature and downpours tomorrow. But it\u0027s not all bad news - as the rain is not expected to last for a long time. The heatwave is set to continue and by the weekend temperatures are likely to get to as high as 31C. A Met Office spokesman told : There will be lots of sunshine across the UK but through the day tomorrow there is a risk of heavy showers and some will be of a thundery nature. There is a risk of thunderstorms tomorrow particularly in the south and south east of England. Some places might see a downpour.  But there will still be sunshine. And by Friday it will be dry as temperatures continue to rise. Temperatures could hit 31C in the south by Saturday.  The glorious heat in Britain is forecast to remain even through the second half of July and August. Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts previously said: “There’s no sign of an end to the heat. Warmth looks like continuing for the first half of July. And forecast models point to above-average temperatures for much of July and August.” High pressure over the UK is causing the high levels of sunshine and clear skies.

Jack Shepherd, 30, allegedly caused the death of Charlotte Brown, 24, when they were thrown into the water after the boat they were in hit a floating tree trunk. The vessel was travelling at twice the speed limit for the stretch of water on the River Thames in London, the Old Bailey heard. Shepherd is accused of breaching his duty of care to Charlotte by letting her take the wheel without wearing a jacket, having a kill cord or the skill to steer. The steering wheel was not fully responsive and needed to be moved extra degrees, jurors were told. The court heard how in a video she filmed before the crash, Ms Brown could be heard saying oh my God, you\u0027re going so fast. The pair were on their first date and had dined at The Shard where they downed two bottles of red wine, having met just hours earlier, the court heard. After getting a taxi to Shepherd\u0027s houseboat in Hammersmith, west London, at around 9.15pm on December 8, 2015, the pair went to see the Houses of Parliament in Westminster.  The court heard how after drinking some more wine the pair jumped into his speed boat and downed Champagne, which he used as part of his seduction ritual. On the return journey to west London Shepherd and Charlotte swapped places so she could steer, it was alleged. But as she tried to avoid construction barges at speed she swerved and struck the log and the boat capsized, the Old Bailey heard. Shepherd\u0027s calls for help were heard by residents near Plantation Wharf at around 11.45pm and the Met\u0027s riverboats, police helicopter, the Coastguard, and the London Fire Brigade alerted, the court was told.  Charlotte, also known as Charli, was pulled from the water between Putney Bridge and Wandsworth Bridge at around 12.10am after floating upstream, jurors were told. She died later that morning in hospital, the cause of death was given as cold water immersion, a post mortem revealed. Shepherd managed to cling to the boat and was also hypothermic when he was found by rescuers in the river clutching the upturned bow. The Old Bailey heard today that on the start of the journey to Westminster, Shepherd was travelling at three times the speed limit of 12knots, and when Charlotte started coming back she was going at 20knots at the point of impact, when the limit is 12knots.  One witness told police he saw the boat going so fast he thought it was a chase. The boat was also seen veering from side to side when Charlotte was driving, jurors were told. Aftab Jafferjee, prosecuting, said there were a number of safety features the boat did not have, including a kill cord which stops the engine during an emergency. He also said the 14ft vessel\u0027s windscreen suffered from crazing which made it hard to see through and the driver had to sit on the back of the seat. Also, the wooden planks under the driver\u0027s seat were rotten, jurors were told. Mr Jafferjee added: It was an accident waiting to happen, we say, due to the state of the boat that night and one of these features could have so easily been the cause of her death and the cause of her going in to the water. The steering system should have been flush but it didn\u0027t do that. It just went in partly, which was a problem for the steering column shift. That was not secured properly on the side so the cable would slide. It meant the steering needed to be moved several extra degrees from left to right before the motor even reacted to the input from the driver.  Whilst the owner maybe over time become used to it, but a novice or inexperienced driver would have great difficulty controlling this boat and keeping it on a straight line. The kill cord should have been attached to Jack Shepherd\u0027s wrist in case he fell into the water the engine would stop. If the kill cord is not used there is nothing to stop the boat from circling around and around. Jurors heard Shepherd had been speeding before handing 24-year-old Miss Brown the wheel to give her an extra thrill. The court heard it is not a legal requirement to wear a life jacket, but that Shepherd had been warned by police it was the right thing to do. Me Jafferjee added: This was an extremely busy waterway at night in an extremely challenging location. There was a considerable degree of rubbish and large number of floating tree trunks. The danger to small vessels is high and high competence in needed. Anyone who frequently travels on the Thames would be aware of this. The change of driver, experts say, allows for the somewhat erratic behaviour as the boat approached Plantation Wharf as well as the apparent last minute actions to avoid a submerged object.

Natasha Scott, 21, wept as she was sentenced to three years in prison for causing death by dangerous driving .  A court heard the mum had only passed her driving test 11 months before the smash, which happened after she lost control of her Vauxhall Corsa on a rural lane near Ayr, west Scotland. Scott ploughed her car into a fence, brick wall and telegraph pole before coming to a halt. Her boyfriend Kai Milligan, 21, died at the scene after a fence post smashed through a rear window and struck him in the face on July 24, 2016.  Three teens were hurt in the collision. One - a 15-year-old lad - needed major surgery to reconstruct his face. Scott was caged on Tuesday after she admitted causing death by dangerous driving and injuring the other passengers. She was also banned from the roads for five years. Sentencing at the High Court in Glasgow, Judge Lady Stacey said: You know your dangerous driving caused the death of Kai Milligan and you have to live with that knowledge.  You also caused serious injury to another young man. The accident happened because you failed to negotiate a hill crest and a left hand bend. Your exact speed cannot be ascertained but you increased your speed on the straight and failed to decrease it despite there being a bend and signs on the road to slow down. You knew that road having driven it many times.  The court heard how Scott had increased her speed  seconds before the crash. The Vauxhall became airborne after the reckless motorist lost control at a bend.  Scott, from Ayr, later gave a no comment interview to police.

She\u0027s had an allergic reaction so strong she\u0027s effectively become housebound.  It\u0027s got so bad that she\u0027s been waking up in the morning with eyes swollen and her throat closed and has had to call in sick at work.  But at least her boyfriend is on her side.  He sent her a text in which he\u0027d claimed to have done some research on home remedies,and informed her that anal sex is the best thing for hay fever. In case you\u0027re wondering, this is not true or backed up by science.

Finding a message from the previous owner of the home inside the wall is probably not one of them. But that\u0027s exactly what happened when Alex and Jess Monney decided to spruce their house up a little. In a post on Twitter, which so far has been liked more than 40,000 times, Alex revealed that their contractor had uncovered something unusual when demolishing their bathroom. They were sent a photo of part of the wall, which to their surprise, featured a message.  It said: Hi! We\u0027re the Shinseki\u0027s. We remodelled this bathroom summer 1995. If you\u0027re reading this, that means you\u0027re remodelling the bathroom again. What\u0027s wrong with the way we did it? Alongside the message was an image of Mr and Mrs Shinseki and a photo of a rabbit. Another message informed Alex and Jess that the rabbit was potty trained and also lived in the house. It\u0027s name was Cassie.    Jess said the discovery \u0027made her day\u0027. The couple have since confirmed that they will be adding their own message into the wall during the remodelling process. They are now on the hunt to find the Shinsekis and may already have found a lead - with someone tweeting that Mr Shinseki is his younger brother.

And it ended with a viral tweet and a possible new romance. You just can\u0027t make this stuff up. Actress Rosey Blair and her boyfriend Houston Hardaway were flying home to Dallas, Texas but realised they hadn\u0027t booked seats together. Hoping to enjoy each other\u0027s company, they asked a woman if they could switch seats with her. She agreed and they made a joke that her new seat partner could become the love of her life. What happened next is just incredible.    Seriously, you\u0027ll want to get the popcorn out for this - we\u0027re talking rom-com levels of entertainment.  A flirtation began between the woman and a \u0027hunky\u0027 man who came to sit beside her and because it\u0027s 2018, Rosey live tweeted the whole thing.  Her thread begins: Last night on a flight home, my boyfriend and I asked a woman to switch seats with me so we could sit together. We mad a joke that maybe her new seat partner would be the love of her life and well, now I present you with this thread.    The first post revealed that the mystery pair had instantly hit it off and started flirting. Turns out they had a lot in common - they\u0027re both personal trainers and vegetarians. And after some snooping, Rosey noticed that neither were wearing wedding rings. She continues to watch and can\u0027t help but get excited every time their arms touch.    Things progress gradually during the flight, with the pair sharing a cheese board, following each other on Instagram and even talking about what they want for their future - including marriage and kids.  Rosey originally posted the story to her Instagram , where her followers were hooked.  After much sleuthing, Houston managed to find them on social media and discovered they both lived in the same city and were both single - a perfect coincidence.    Rosey ended the thread with a short video, which showed her jumping around excitedly, proclaiming that the pair were going to \u0027get married and have babies\u0027. The \u0027hunky\u0027 guy was later revealed as 30-year-old former professional footballer Euan Holden, who played for Stockport County and Bury.

Anthony Doolin bought the property, in Brisbane, Australia, over three years ago for $1.35million (\u0026pound754,000). But it wasn\u0027t until he went wandering around his 16.5 hectares of land that he made the startling find. And it turns out the estate, which is just 12 miles from the central business district of Brisbane, is home to number of other mines. They had remained hidden in the hills since the turn of the century - until now. A surprised Mr Doolin revealed he immediately thought of movie character Indiana Jones when he stumbled upon the mines.  He told realestate.au: We weren’t told about it, we just found it there one day. “I nearly fell over, I just pictured Indiana Jones and underground railroads. There was a lot of mining at the turn of the century and in those hills there are quite a few little mines. It’s about six metres deep and is still intact.”  Despite the spectacular discovery, Mr Doolin didn\u0027t explore the mines further in search of precious gold. And he parted ways with the stunning estate last week. His mother Jane sold the property for him. The reported asking price of $1.65million (\u0026pound922,000) was not met and the Mr Doolin eventually settled for the same fee he had initially paid for it.

Chiang Rai provincial governor Narongsak Osatanakor, who is heading rescue efforts , says the boys may be removed in stages, saying all 13 may not come out at the same time.  Footage shows how the 12 boys and their 25-year-old team coach are in good spirits despite their harrowing ordeal that has left them trapped underground for 11 days. The boys, aged 11 to 16, are seen laughing and joking with Thai Navy SEAL divers in a minute-long clip released to the public on Tuesday.  Wrapped in foil blankets, the schoolboys appear gaunt and underweight as their faces are illuminated by the divers\u0027 flashlight. Rescue teams have been giving the group crash courses in swimming and diving as they prepare to get them out safely amid fears they could remain trapped for weeks or months. Organisers are willing to act fast to free the boys if waters subside, but will take a no risk approach to the operation. The water is very strong and space is narrow. Extracting the children takes a lot of people, Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters. Now we are teaching the children to swim and dive, he added.  Nearly 125 million litres of water have been pumped from the cave in a bid to keep the boys safe. Rick Stanton and John Volanthen were the first divers to reach the boys who disappeared in Luang Nang Non Cave, in Chiang Rai province, on June 23. Two elite British cave divers have revealed they are willing to once again navigate the challenging 2.5 mile journey to the boys, which three hours each way. Mr Stanton, a fireman in his fifties from Coventry, and Mr Volanthen, an IT consultant in his forties based in Bristol, have broken diving world records together and both received medals for a complex 10-day rescue attempt in France in 2010.  But rescuers are now grappling with the challenge of safely extracting the group through nearly a mile of tunnels, large portions of which are underwater, with heavy rainfall forecast. Mr Grass said he thinks the British divers would be happier diving with another four or five Brits who they know, who they\u0027ve shared danger and experiences with, rather than people they do not know. We have other divers that are ready to go out, and with other equipment, he said, adding: There are various things that we have in the UK that are fairly unique to caving in as much as we have a radio system that will work underground.

But to have that high-quality urbanism, you must also have the population.“We need to have enough people in the city to be able to justify investing in our buildings and infrastructure to create smart sustainable spaces, so it is exciting to hear we are on the right path.”Dundee City Council’s city development convener Lynne Short said a bustling centre could yield benefits for the whole of Dundee.“Living in the heart of a city can be a great experience and we already have the infrastructure in place to welcome people and help them make the most of living in Dundee,” she said.The increase in city living across the UK has been driven by young people attracted to a growing number of high-skilled, high-paying office jobs in spaces rich with amenities.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39f0252c187-516x564.jpg ","title":"huge turnover of players has cost dundee united dear","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSince relegation from the top flight in 2016, Dundee United have seen a massive 86 transfers in and out of Tannadice.The remarkable turnover of players just shows what the price of failure is – by the club as a whole and those players, some of whom have been and gone with very little success.And, with business still to be done over the next couple of months in re-shaping the current squad, that total is expected to rise even further before too long.Since the departure of Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven at the end of January 2015 – the point where United’s downfall from cup finals and European football towards the second tier can be traced back to – the complete lack of continuity is an obvious factor in the club’s failure over recent seasons.Add in four managerial changes in that time and that’s a recipe for a whole lot of trouble.The number 86, obviously, includes a few players twice – i.e. they were transferred in and then transferred out – but since relegation the Tangerines have signed a huge 42 players in the past two years.Manager Csaba Laszlo has lifted the lid on how unorganised the club were last season and the number of ins and outs only strengthens that perception.This summer, Csaba, with help from chief scout Paul Sturrock, has brought in nine players already – with more expected.The big hope is this completely revamped team can finally get them back to the Premiership – something the 33 signings before them have distinctly failed to do.The pressure is on Nicky Clark, Callum Booth, Sam Wardrop, Fraser Aird, Craig Curran, Frederic Frans, Benjamin Siegrist, Matej Rakovan and Christoph Rabitsch to be the men that fire the Tangerines back up and have Arabs watching top-flight action come 2019/20.Last summer, 19 players were brought in by then manager Ray McKinnon and 13 the previous one immediately after suffering the drop.Of those 32, only 10 remain at the club and a few of those probably have a short future. They are Lewis Toshney, William Edjenguele, Stewart Murdoch, Fraser Fyvie, Deniz Mehmet, Billy King, Paul McMullan, Tam Scobbie, James Keatings and Sam Stanton. How many of them play a meaningful role in the push for promotion this coming season, however, is certainly up for debate.In the past two campaigns under McKinnon and Laszlo, United haven’t been a million miles away from getting themselves up through the play-offs.Add in a bit of continuity through their playing squad and around it surely can only help the club get back to where they feel they belong.A list of those 86 transfers, who have arrived, departed or done both: Harry Souttar, Darko Bodul, Eiji Kawashima, Chris Erskine, Michal Szromnik, Callum Morris, John Rankin, Paul Paton, Florent Sinama-Pongolle, Henri Anier, Edward Ofere, Guy Demel, Ryan Dow, Gavin Gunning, Toshney, Frank van der Struijk, Nick van der Velden, Willo Flood, Cammy Bell, Edjenguele, Murdoch, Tope Obadeyi, Alex Nicholls, Tony Andreu, Thomas Mikkelsen, Cammy Smith, Wato Kuate, Paul Dixon, Coll Donaldson, Simon Murray, Sean Dillon, Charlie Telfer, Luis Zwick, Blair Spittal, Brad Smith, Ali Coote, Grant Gillespie, Fyvie, Emil Lyng, Patrick N’Koyi, Paul Quinn, King, Scobbie, McMullan, Keatings, Craig Slater, Scott McDonald, Jordie Briels, Harry Lewis, Stanton, Brandon Mason, Anthony Ralston, Bilel Mohsni, Clark, Booth, Wardrop, Aird, Curran, Frans, Siegrist, Rakovan and Rabitsch.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"improving dundee city cycle routes in future vital","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans to improve cycling routes in Dundee will be put in place after data from a new bike counter showed more than 10,000 cycle journeys were made through Broughty Ferry last month.The counter was installed on May 29 at the cycle lane near the beachfront to record how many people use the path and to predict demand for similar routes elsewhere.In just 30 days, a total of 10,062 cyclists were recorded passing the counter.Councillor Kevin Cordell, cycling spokesman for Dundee City Council, said it was “vital” for the city to improve its connectivity.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]  if (d.getElementById(id)) return  js = d.createElement(s) js.id = id  js.src = \u0027https://connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1\u0026version=v3.0\u0027  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))Photo taken last night of the cycle counter in the Ferry.

I just couldn’t believe it.“It is hard – it gets me down sometimes. But I think I just need to be as positive as I can – especially for the kids.“They have been through so much, just seeing me so ill all the time has been really hard on them.“For them to see me upset about this would make it even harder for them – I have to stay strong.“The two older ones have been told and I think the third one knows too but the youngest two don’t.”Jennie said partner Francis had been “her rock” throughout the treatment and subsequent diagnosis.Despite only being together for two years, Jennie said she “knew he was the one” almost immediately – and looks forward to them becoming man and wife.She said: “We were engaged before I was first diagnosed with cervical cancer but we didn’t even have an engagement party because I had to get chemotherapy.“After that we didn’t rearrange because of everything that was going on. I had lost my hair and put on weight from the steroids I was having to take.”Friend Roni Christie, manager of the Ambassador Bar, who is involved in fundraising for the wedding, said a special night is to be held at the venue.Roni said: “We have got everything people can think of – we have fortune tellers, mascots and the raffle prizes are looking brilliant so far.“We just want to make sure that they both get the day they always wanted and so that they can concentrate on their family for the time they have left.”Roni added that any surplus money will be used to fund a stay-cation type holiday for the family, as Jennie is unable to travel abroad.Jennie has called for people given the all-clear from all types of cancer to be given regular, full body tests. She said she had “begged” doctors for one on a weekly basis, after sensing something was wrong with her lungs, since she was told she was free of cancer.She said: “I just think that it is stupid. I was at the doctors every week – sometimes more – asking for a full body scan because I knew that something was wrong.“I just think it is crazy – I just wonder if it could have been found ages ago.”The fundraising night takes place on Clepington Road on Saturday July 14.People who want to help Jennie and Francis ahead of their wedding can do so by visiting gofundme/t5jx8-jennies-final-journey.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39f01324c04-e1530527591774-817x564.jpg ","title":"new boy elton looks to rocket dundee up the premiership table and says the skys the limit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew boy Elton Ngwatala insists the sky’s the limit for Dundee as they look to make an assault on the Premiership top-half next season.The French midfielder, signed from Kidderminster Harriers earlier in the summer, made his second appearance in dark blue in last night\u0026#8217s 1-0 win at Cowdenbeath.This followed his debut on Friday night in a 1-1 friendly draw with Brechin City at Glebe Park.Fellow summer arrival, Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy, got the visitors’ only goal just before the hour-mark as Kharl Madianga, Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph and trialist Brian Nana-Sinkam also got their first run-outs for Dundee.And 25-year-old Ngwatala believes there is no stopping him and his new team-mates from scaling the heights in the top flight next term – with a top-six finish a known aim of manager Neil McCann.“Friday night was my first game and it felt good to play with the new lads,” he said.“They are all new team-mates for me but, with 45 minutes in the tank, now I can improve.“Hopefully, within the next couple of weeks it will be perfect.“I think there is no limit next season. We have to take each game one by one and do the best we can to get the win.”Ngwatala admits the appeal to take his game to the next level was a huge factor in his move north of the border after playing in England’s sixth tier for the past three campaigns.As well as playing in front of terrific atmospheres at Dens Park, he is looking forward to testing himself on live television and under the spotlight of big crowds at Parkhead and Ibrox.He went on: “Dundee play in the Premiership so, for me, it was a big step up from playing in the Conference North in England.“It was important for me to move to Scotland and it feels like the right time to make this step.“I want to play at the highest level and going up against Celtic and Rangers is a big deal.“I have to test myself at the highest level.”Ngwatala also heaped praise on boss Neil and the rest of the staff at the club for welcoming him to the fold.The midfield man feels he has settled into the club with ease, though when asked if he has picked up on the local lingo yet, he said: “No, nothing yet!“The training has been nice to be fair, everybody has made me feel very welcome to the club, so it’s good,” he added.“The sessions have been good with the manager.”The Frenchman’s focus now is to show supporters more of what they can expect from him in the new campaign.He added: “I like to get on the ball, create things, make things happen.“Connecting and playing with my team-mates in short spaces is important but sometimes I do like a long shot!”Ngwatala’s new gaffer Neil was delighted his new boys got some valuable minutes under their belts despite drawing in Angus, saying: “I’m not really looking too much into the performances.“It was more just fitness and we had a number of new faces who joined us for the first time on Friday and it’s going to take a wee bit of time to get that understanding.“Overall, I was quite happy with the two 45 minutes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3c949e69a6e-466x564.jpg ","title":"revamped dundee united impress in victory at glebe park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew-look Dundee United looked good as they strolled to victory in the sunshine at Brechin on Tuesday night.Playing what could be the only public friendly of their build-up to the new campaign, the Tangerines started with eight of their nine summer signings.And all impressed as Csaba Laszlo’s men knocked the ball around well and breached the home defence on two occasions.Encouragingly for the several hundred fans who chose to escape England’s World Cup win over Colombia and made the journey to Glebe Park, there was a cohesion about United’s play that probably no one had a right to expect so early in the rebuilding process that’s been undertaken since the disappointment of missing out on promotion at the end of last season.What was apparent within a few minutes of kick-off was Laszlo has added strength and energy to his squad.From a defence that was well marshalled by Frederic Frans to a front line led ably by Craig Curran, the team looked sharp and powerful.Frans looks exactly the kind of dominant defender that was needed to replace Bilel Mohsni, who’d done so well during his short stay towards the end of last term.And out wide Callum Booth showed his Premiership quality at left-back, while Sam Wardrop on the right did enough to suggest he will be an able replacement for his former Celtic youth team-mate Anthony Ralston.In the middle of the park Austrian Christoph Rabitsch added bite, while ahead of him Curran and Nicky Clark showed good understanding for their first outing up front together.Elsewhere, wide man Fraser Aird was first to show what he can bring to the team when he picked up the ball 40 yards from goal and jinked his way past several challenges before netting with a low shot.That opener came with just seven minutes or so on the clock but already United were knocking the ball around in the manner their gaffer likes.It wasn’t just about the new boys, however, and the few familiar faces in the line-up gave a good account of themselves.Sam Stanton was his usual industrial self in midfield and used the ball well. Likewise, young Scott Allardice slotted in comfortably alongside Frans in central defence.Originally a midfielder, he’s now impressed a few times in that deeper role and would certainly be worth another look there when the Betfred Cup group matches kick-off in under a fortnight.Returning to the new faces, a clue who will be handed the goalkeeper’s jersey when the competitive action starts was perhaps given when Swiss Benjamin Siegrist was preferred to Slovakian Matej Rakovan in goal.Siegrist was almost caught out when he was slow to field a pass back in the first half but, generally, looked sound.Rakovan did come on for the second half and did nothing wrong but right now it appears he has work to do to be in the side when Arbroath are faced in that first Betfred tie on Saturday week.While the game did fizzle out a bit in the second half, another boost for United was the appearance of James Keatings for the final 15 minutes or so.The attacker’s first season at Tannadice was ruined by injuries but, if he can stay fit, he’s a player who can play a significant part in what lies ahead.It was his shot with ten minutes left that struck the bar and went in off home defender Euan Spark for the second.Keatings then struck the post with a clever curling effort from 16 yards out.Had that gone in, the score would have provided a fairer reflection of United’s good work.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3c93831d801-846x564.jpg ","title":"special hands on event at dundee science centre this weekend","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSome of science’s more intriguing mysteries, such as humans’ genetic link to bonobos (a species of chimpanzee) and the journey of our digestive system, will be brought to life on Saturday at a one-off special event.Organised by University of Dundee masters students Hannah Newey and Lissie Cowley, the free event invites members of the public to get hands-on with human and bonobo anatomy.“The Art of Anatomy”, which takes place at the Dundee Science Centre between 10am-4pm, will include interactive 3D models, a kids’ crafting station and scheduled talks from anatomist Luke Reid.Hannah said: “Humans share 99% of their DNA with bonobos.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

It also aims to guarantee that all commitments to suppliers are fulfilled.The Inverness franchise has been held for about the last two years by American Jack Alldredge who is understood to be from Florida.The company\u0027 managing director Mike Williams said Mr Alldredge had hoped to settle in the UK after visiting the country.\"He loved the idea of living here and fell in love with Inverness,\" Mr Williams said.\"But he has had immigration issues. Sometimes we make it difficult for people to invest in this country. It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements were in place while Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans called for glass panels to be removed from canopies at all the city\u0027 retail parks.Thursday 5 Jul 2018 6:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/01828000/01828031.jpg","title":"Druim Ba wind farm rejected","story":"Plans for 10 turbines at Druim Ba between Kiltarlity and Abriachan have been rejected today by the Scottish Government after a second public inquiry.\u0026nbspGeneral wind farm campaigner Lyndsey Ward was \"delighted\"She said: \"The community has had seven years of wind farm developers trying to get a wind farm in that area.

changes to a funding formula which he claims leaves busy urban routes at a serious disadvantage.Milton Crescent in Hilton is to be completely resurfaced at a cost of \u0026pound100,000 and the work is due to start on Monday.Other roads across the city \u0026ndash including Midmills Road in the Crown area and Caledonian Road and Montague Row in Dalneigh are also set to have their potholes filled in.But Ness-side councillor Ron MacWilliam has called for a rethink on the way damaged roads are prioritised.At present, funds are allocated according to a formula which gives more weighting to length of road than traffic volumes.As a result, Mr MacWilliam said roads in Inverness were having less money spent on them than rural roads in the far north of Sutherland. He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate. The roads office has a fantastic team but they are fighting a losing battle.\"With regards to the funding formula, Mr MacWilliam said he was continuing to press the matter but he faced strong opposition from the much larger number of Highland councillors who represent rural wards.However, residents in Milton Crescent are just happy that work there is finally going ahead.Edward Dyce (76) relies on his vehicle to get around and said: \"I have had a lot of problems with my car because of the road surface. It\u0027 getting worse because of the amount of traffic.\"A lot of people use the road and the potholes have become a real problem.

into hostel dorm","story":"\u0026nbspA WOMEN\u0026rsquoS rights group has expressed concerns for the safety of guests staying at a Highland hostel after one of its bloggers was able to book herself into a male-only dormitory.Inverness Youth Hostel in Victoria Drive allowed Trina Budge to stay in a men\u0027 room after she told a receptionist she self-identified as a man.She went on to write a blog post about her stay and said she is concerned women could be at risk as a result of people taking advantage of the self-determination policy.She said: \"There are huge concerns over safety. When you book a single-sex room at a hostel you expect it to be exactly that.\"We are not anti-transgender but we are concerned there are people who will take advantage of the policy.\"There\u0027 a danger that people who are genuinely transgender will become scapegoats because of people who abuse the policy.\"I have emailed Hostelling Scotland with regard to what happened and have asked to discuss with them how they plan to protect the needs of all their guests.\"Mrs Budge\u0027 blog post included a screenshot of an email in which the hostel revealed it did not have \"a specific transgender policy\" but would book accommodation \"based on how our guests choose to be recognised\".A spokeswoman for the Highland LGBT Forum said: \"The hostel decided to take her at her word. I don\u0026rsquot think that was the correct decision.\"A person who identifies as a specific gender will always try and present themselves as such.\"This woman found a loophole in the way the hostel treats transgender people. It\u0027 a difficult problem, and the youth hostel need to look into it.\"The important thing that stuck out in the original blog post was that Hostelling Scotland does not have a specific transgender policy.\"They allocate rooms based on how guests choose to be identified but people who genuinely are transgender will present themselves as the gender they wish to be recognised as.\"Despite the incident, Hostelling Scotland insisted that it will maintain its policy.A spokesman said: \"Hostelling Scotland is an organisation open to all and we treat all our guests with respect and dignity.

Milne said: “This is one of the most important occasions for the club.“What we are going to embark upon over the next three to four years is this facility and then move on to the stadium.“That is really going to transform the club and set us up on a fantastic basis to move into the next period.“To finally get on site and see the diggers working is a massive day for the football club.“I am very proud that we have achieved that.”Aberdeen put the application for the £50m stadium and training facility on hold last October as they wanted more time to discuss the matter with planners.In January the plans were approved by councillors when members voted 32 to nine in favour of the application to build the new stadium and training facilities.“It has been a long, frustrating journey, the best part of 20 years that we have been trying to get a site for a new stadium and the much-needed training facilities,” said Milne.“At times you feel you are making progress and then for whatever reason things grind to a halt.“The fact this is the third site we have actually got planning permission for speaks for itself.“The other two we got the consents but for various reasons outwith the club’s control we weren’t able to go ahead with them.”The first phase of the £50m development will include the construction of the training pavilion, groundsman’s accommodation, three professional training pitches, two 3G pitches and two grass pitches.Milne confirmed the full £10m has yet to be secured but he is confident of raising the funds.He said: “We still have work to do to get the balance of the funding in place.“But we are confident that one way or another we will get that lined up.“Everyone knows it has been a really challenging last few years economically for everyone in the region.“It is not the ideal time to be raising funds but one way or another we will get that.”The No Kingsford Stadium protest group are pursuing a judicial review in a bid to stop the project going ahead.Aberdeen-based McIntosh Plant Hire now have the go- ahead to begin the initial earthworks and ground remediation in preparation for the building work, which is scheduled to start in October.Milne said: “This is the start of delivering the much-needed facilities for the club.“Hopefully this time next year we will be standing here and seeing the first phase come into completion.“Seeing the guys come back for their pre-season training next year with their base here will be absolutely fantastic.”Following the completion of the training complex the Reds will then have to secure the £40m for the stadium, which is scheduled for completion in 2021.At the club’s AGM last December Milne confirmed the sale of Pittodrie would raise 40% of the £40m, i.e. £16m.That still leaves a £24m shortfall.Milne said: “Once the first phase is delivered we will have to step back and take a deep breath before we tackle the stadium.“That will be a major challenge to raise all the funds that are required for that.“If we can deliver the first phase it will be a massive step forward.”Aberdeen are now the official owners of the 25-hectare site at Kingsford and contracts are due to be agreed in the coming weeks for work such as pavilion construction and the formation of the pitches.It is now almost two decades since Aberdeen first announced their intention to move from Pittodrie in January 1999.The club had earmarked a site on the road between Aberdeen and Kingswells to become the new home for the Dons.Planning consent was eventually granted, but on the condition that the Scottish FA were successful with a bid to host the Euro 2008 finals.When the Euro bid failed, so did the proposal.Aberdeen also planned on a move to a stadium at Loirston, but with an additional smaller stadium at Calder Park. But in August 2012 city councillors voted by 24-19 to retain control of Calder Park.Then aspirations to house the training complex at Balgownie, Bridge of Don, collapsed in 2015.Throughout all those setbacks Milne never gave up hope of delivering a state-of-the-art training complex.“You always have to believe that you will get there in the end,” he said.“It would be easy to give up when you keep hitting brick walls and are thinking you are not going to get there.“But we have a lot of good people around us as part of the team over the years and they have been a good driving force as well.“This is a reward for an awful lot of people who have put hard work in including Derek (McInnes), who has played a key role in helping us get consent.“He hasn’t just stayed there in the background to wait and see what happened.“He took very much a forward role in the whole thing and that has been very beneficial to us.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen park car park to shut for resurfacing","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe car park at a popular Aberdeen park will be shut for two days this week.Duthie Park\u0026#8217s Riverside Drive car park will be closed tomorrow and Friday for resurfacing work.Visitors to the park are still able to park on Great Southern Road, beside Allenvale Cemetery and also on Riverside Drive.Aberdeen City Council are also reminding people that motorists should not park on the grass or in any other areas outside the designated parking spaces or they could be issued with a ticket.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeens boozy cow to reopen under new name after major refurb1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPopular Aberdeen bar and restaurant The Boozy Cow is to reopen this summer under a new name next month.The venue will reopen under the name The Spiritualist and will under go an extensive refurbishment.It will include a food and drinks menu filled with cocktails, craft beers and a selection of wines and will be serving breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks.Signature Pubs, the company behind the new eatery, has also vowed to support local suppliers by using their produce.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"first speakeasy in city set to bring spirit of jazz age1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen’s first-ever speakeasy is to open in the autumn after councillors gave the green light.PB Devco, which runs eight venues across Aberdeen, will launch the 21 Crimes “secret” bar at the former Filling Station premises on Union Street in late autumn.The bar – named after the number of offences that would result in deportation to Australia in the 1920s – will be at basement level and a grill house restaurant called Vovem will be on the ground floor.The project took a step forward yesterday when Aberdeen City Council’s licensing board met to grant the premises a licence.It means the bar can open until 3am at weekends. NHS Grampian asked PB Devco to explain how the premises would fulfil the licensing requirement of providing “significant entertainment”.In a letter to the board, NHS Grampian’s public health consultant Dr Tara Shivaji said: “I understand the basement bar will possibly be themed as a prohibition/1920s type premises with jazz, informal and recorded music provided.“The entertainment on offer at these premises would appear to be low key.”However, according to licensing board member Councillor David Cameron, PB Devco successfully argued at the meeting the bar itself would be a draw.“They put forward a very convincing argument and the idea of a secret bar with hidden entrances is very clever,” said Mr Cameron.He added: “Most importantly, they made a well-rounded argument to address all the concerns of NHS Grampian and the police.”PB Devco operations director Paul Clarkson said: “We are delighted with the licensing board’s decision.“It is great news. The venue will be exciting, though we want to keep certain details under wraps for now. It will create between 30 and 40 jobs and will be something completely new for Aberdeen.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/EE2_Meerkats-07.jpg-525x564.jpg ","title":"meerkat2","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA beloved meerkat which helped boost visitor numbers at an Aberdeen petting zoo has passed away.Don, who arrived at Hazlehead Park’s Pets Corner last July, died on Thursday.The cause of the cute critter’s death is currently unknown but Aberdeen City Council, which owns the attraction, said a post-mortem examination would be carried out.Its operational delivery convener John Wheeler paid tribute to the “hugely popular” meerkat, who was around one year old.He said: “We are very sad to have to report that Don the meerkat passed away on Thursday.“Earlier in the day, staff noticed that Don was unwell, and they took him to the vet, however, he died a short time later.\u0026#8221A post-mortem has established Don died of a hole in the heart.Don was hugely popular with visitors to Pets Corner at Hazlehead Park along with fellow meerkat Dee.Meantime, council staff are trying to source another meerkat so Dee isn’t on her own for too long.Male Don moved to Pets Corner just under a year ago, along with female Dee – the duo were named by local primary school pupils.They arrived following a £750,000 renovation and helped set a new record day for visitors with 1,640 heading through the attraction’s doors on July 8 last year.Other animals at the facility – which has been a firm favourite with Aberdeen families for more than five decades – include alpacas, kune kune pigs, geese, turkey, chickens, sheep, goats, a Shetland pony, miniature donkeys, fish, reptiles, budgies, ducks, finches, chipmunks, guinea fowl, ferrets, rabbits, chinchilla, guinea pigs, Vader the Burmese python and Gethin the pygmy goat.As part of last year’s renovation works the council replaced the roof, undertook internal alterations and installed new fish and reptile tanks, a new external access ramp and paths, and an upgrade to the staff facilities.An education room was also added.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"musicians praise for service which put him on road to recovery","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen musician who battled cancer today praised the NHS and its staff.Sean McBain, 34, from Torry, was 20 years old at the time he found a lump on his tongue that turned out to be tongue cancer.He said: “I was diagnosed with cancer in the tongue back in 2003.“From diagnosis to operation the service was professional, comforting and above all fast.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland. The last time I crossed Scotland for the appeal I was swimming and running, so cycling has to be easier… right?\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216Thanks to everyone who gets involved and I look forward to riding with you.\u0026#8217Mari Slavin of the STV Children’s Appeal said: \u0026#8216Mark is a fantastic ambassador for the Appeal and we are all in awe of the gigantic challenge he’s about to take on, together with cyclists from across the country. STV’s cameras will be there – and trying hard to keep up! – to capture the highs and lows of this incredible marathon venture\u0026#8217After a 4am start in Argyll, Mark’s 240-mile cycle route will pass through Tarbert, Ardrishaig, Lochgilphead, Inveraray, Tyndrum, Crainlarich, Killin, Aberfeldy, Pitlochry, Glenshee, Braemar, Ballater and Peterculter \u0026#8211 among many other towns and villages \u0026#8211 before finishing in Aberdeen.If you think you’re up for this epic feat of endurance, get in touch with Mark on aroundtheworld@thehunterfoundationA corporate offer is also available with four-person relay teams invited to enter for a minimum donation of £5,000.Can’t face the cycle but still want to be involved?

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen. This throw ensured fifth place overall for Sophie out of almost 200 girls and the points gained allowed the B team to finish above the A team. The A team finished only half a second ahead of the B team in the 4 x 100 metres relay. The B team consisted of Maisie Gilmour and Jodie Allan from Ardrishaig, Sophie Balkeen from Lochgair and Erin Naisby from Furnace.The girls contest was won by Law and District.This national competition was a great experience, not just for the young athletes competing in the big arena, but also for the supportive parents who provided transport on the day.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"picts and vikings in focus for strachur youth drama club","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/07/18, 7:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowStrachur Youth and Drama Club\u0026#8217s summer film school is back this year.The young filmmakers are blazing a trail around the Cowal peninsula to create a historical adventure movie made up of early Celts, Picts, Scotti and Vikings.Club founder Sheena Dowse said: ‘We are following the path of early settlers and telling their stories of faith, bravery, family and determination to survive in the breathtaking wilderness that was Scotland\u0026#8217s west coast 1,000 years ago.’The programme gives opportunities to explore filmmaking, from the technicalities of visual and audio, to creating costumes or sets.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"watch-glorious-sunshine-marks-the-start-of-a-braw-week","story":"THERE couldn\u0026rsquot have been a more perfect evening to kick-off the biggest week in Galashiels\u0026rsquo calendar.\nThe Braw Lads\u0026rsquo Gathering has already seen a packed schedule with Spurs Night, Threepwood and the Braw Lads\u0026rsquo Sports Day all taking place to name just a few.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    callback: function() {        RelatedArticleBlock.init(false)    },    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716334561,16334557,16333168,16332304,16332276\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

However, the highlight was riding up the Bealach na B\u0026agrave. This is every road biker\u0026rsquos dream climb, and to be able to ride it in the heat was a treat.\n\u0026ldquoThe Bealach na B\u0026agrave is a notorious mountain pass to Applecross.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet.

Galashiels, is working with Commsworld to provide a \u0026lsquonext generation network\u0026rsquo that can deliver speeds 500 times faster than the average UK broadband connection.\nThe smart network

will be dedicated to business users, meaning customers won\u0026rsquot have to contend with residential users using the same connection, which can slow down internet speeds.\nGordon Brown, founder and

boosted.\nCommsworld is an Edinburgh headquartered firm, with offices in Glasgow and Aberdeen and more than 80 staff operating across public and private sector contracts.\nFounded in 1994, it is Scotland\u0026rsquos leading Telecommunications Network Provider, providing customers with a full range of integrated communications solutions.\nCharlie Boisseau, chief operating officer at

download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-prestonpans-childrens-gala-day","story":"  Gala Queen Grace Millar was crowned by Honourable Gentleman Eric Yule before leading her court to the playing fields.

Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.  Areas for improvement were identified and discussed with the headteacher and a representative from East Lothian Council.  They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out.

The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes.

The six-month trials are designed to help the company better understand consumer perceptions and appetite for plastics-recycling technology across the UK.  They come ahead of the expected launch of a national deposit return scheme to which the Scottish, UK and Welsh Governments have all announced their commitment in principle.  The trials will help Iceland to provide government and industry with insights that might support the creation of a national scheme.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"  The phonebox, outside the police station on Court Street, was removed by BT last Tuesday.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

In his speech, headteacher Colin Gerrie thanked both for their \u0026ldquolong and committed service to the school and wished them every happiness in their retirement.  Mrs Cavers, who is originally from Kirkcudbright but now lives in East Lothian, said that her 39 years at Musselburgh Grammar were a great example to pupils of \u0026ldquosticking in at school.  She is planning to travel and spend more time in her garden.  Mr Gellaitry, from Edinburgh, added: \u0026ldquoHaving taught at least two generations at Musselburgh, I feel that it is time to move on.  A speaker of nine different languages, he is hoping to travel the world now he has more leisure time.  Each guidance teacher at Musselburgh Grammar cares for about 200 pupils.  Their work involves teaching classes on internet safety, substance abuse, anti-bullying, sexual health, giving assistance to pupils on college and job applications, motivating pupils, showing commitment to pastoral care and welfare of pupils, and liaising with parents over concerns."},{"url":null,"title":"budding-provosts-receive-praise","story":"  The competition, which asked young people what they would do if they were \u0026lsquoin charge\u0026rsquo, was run by the council as part of the Year of Young People.

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.

Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.

The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.

The proposed \u0026ldquofacilitated customs arrangement would see technology used to determine where goods arriving into the UK will ultimately end up.  This would allow the correct tariff to be paid \u0026ndash either at the UK or EU rate.  According to the Financial Times, Brussels will express concern about the reliance of this plan on untested technology and will question how it is not \u0026ldquoan open invitation to smugglers.  Meanwhile, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) warned that a \u0026ldquobad deal on Brexit could cost it \u0026pound1.2 billion every year.  It follows similar warnings in recent weeks from Airbus and BMW who have voiced concerns about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on UK jobs and investment.  The Prime Minister is trying to find a compromise that will secure support from both wings of her Cabinet on Friday, but critics called for the Government to maintain its red lines on leaving the single market and customs union.  A group of more than 40 Eurosceptic Tories met Chief Whip Julian Smith on Wednesday to air their concerns about the prospect of a soft Brexit which would restrict the UK\u0026rsquos freedom to diverge from EU rules in future.  Mrs May heads to Berlin for talks on subjects including Brexit with Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday, leaving behind a bitterly divided party and Government.  The intervention from JLR saw it warn of \u0026ldquoan unpredictable future for it and its suppliers without \u0026ldquofree and frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market.  Chief executive Dr Ralf Speth, said: \u0026ldquoWe urgently need greater certainty to continue to invest heavily in the UK and safeguard our suppliers, customers and 40,000 British-based employees.  \u0026ldquoA bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than \u0026pound1.2 billion profit each year.  \u0026ldquoAs a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile. We have spent around \u0026pound50 billion in the UK in the past five years, with plans for a further \u0026pound80 billion more in the next five.  \u0026ldquoThis would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.  The Daily  reported that Mr Davis had written to Mrs May, arguing that her new plan to reconcile warring factions over customs arrangements would be rejected out of hand by the EU.  In an attempt to address concerns, Mrs May said at Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions the Government would ensure \u0026ldquowe are out of the customs union, that we are out of the single market, that we are out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, we are out of the Common Agricultural Policy, we are out of the Common Fisheries Policy, we bring an end to free movement, we take control of our borders, we have an independent trade policy.  Her comments came after Jacob Rees-Mogg hit out at reports suggesting the meeting of Cabinet ministers at Chequers would be asked to support close continued alignment on rules for goods and tariffs.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hard to think of a worse idea, he told the BBC\u0026rsquos Daily Politics.  Adopting EU tariffs would be \u0026ldquoabandoning the benefit of Brexit and \u0026ldquoa really foolish policy because it would curtail the UK\u0026rsquos ability to strike its own trade deals.  Asked if he would be prepared to rebel if the Cabinet\u0026rsquos conclusions at Chequers were unacceptable to him, Mr Rees-Mogg said: \u0026ldquoIf the agreement from the Cabinet is that we will give the EU \u0026pound39 billion merely on good faith of the EU\u0026rsquos negotiating a trade deal, I will vote against that. I don\u0026rsquot think I can be clearer than that.  In a sign of the tensions within the Tory ranks, one MP said a meeting of the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) on Tuesday night was the \u0026ldquoangriest he had ever been to \u0026ldquoeven stretching back to Maastricht \u0026ndash referring to the bitter battles fought during John Major\u0026rsquos premiership.  The subsequent meeting with the Chief Whip was used by the ERG MPs to spell out their demands for the forthcoming White Paper, stressing that there must be no watering down of the position set out in the Conservative manifesto.  There was also widespread concern among the MPs about the role being played by Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Europe adviser and the senior official involved in negotiations with Brussels.  And there were demands for a greater emphasis to be placed on preparing for a \u0026ldquono deal Brexit.          Cabinet #Brexiters please stand up for the 17.4 million people who voted to leave.

Local Unite Scotland convener Tommy Robertson said: \u0026ldquoStrike action is always a last resort designed to try and force management into reversing a decision that we oppose and reach an agreement. It is not something we want to do but we are being forced as the changes to member terms and conditions cannot\u0026nbsp be tolerated.

Mr Robertson added: \u0026ldquoI would like to make it clear that we are not asking for anything to be added to our terms and conditions, only that what we currently have is preserved. Staff have already endured several cutbacks and are expected to provide services at the same levels even though many of their colleagues have left.

Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For almost 30 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

Set in a stunning location in the beautiful Ayrshire countryside amidst the Craufurdland Estate near Kilmarnock it is only short drive from Glasgow city-centre.    Surrounded by mature Ash trees and Hawthorn hedgerow, this natural burial ground is quiet and peaceful, set in a long established designated rural area it has stunning countryside views only interrupted by a scattering of farms far off in the distance. The \u0026ldquoWoods is part of Craufurdland Estate, lands given to the Craufurd family in 1245 which has remained in their careful ship ever since. The Craufurds are dedicated to the continued stewardship of the estate, and it is with this in mind that the woodland burial ground was established to allow other families in the West of Scotland and further afield to secure a beautiful and peaceful resting place for their loved ones.  Still operated by the Craufurd family today, brothers Alex and Simon, are always on hand, to walk with you and your family through the tranquil pastures of Craufurdland Woods taking time to show you around before selecting this most serene resting place for your loved one. At Craufurdland Woods natural burial ground no embalming is permitted and all coffins must be biodegradable. Types of Coffin recommended are Pine, Bamboo and Wicker \u0026ndash Cardboard, or any other biodegradable coffin.    The funerals here are as diverse as the people whom are represented or the lives they celebrate. We have prepared broad and varied funerals, several have had religious services, where the ground has been consecrated, to a 5piece ceilidh band to a biker funeral with a sidecar hearse.  Craufurdland Castle can be used for a beautiful and secluded venue for an intimate and exclusive funeral ceremony, and/or for the funeral tea.  What about a funeral director- Do we need one?\u0026nbsp The simple answer is no - It\u0026rsquos about what\u0026rsquos important to you and how you want your funeral conducted, with or without the assistance of a Funeral director all are welcome. Having bespoke options is what makes Craufurdland Woods special for so many who have laid their loved ones to rest in this tranquil setting.  An indigenous tree of your choosing marks the graves, should you wish the graves can also be marked with engraved natural stone plaque. Early each year, families are invited to plant their chosen tree (from the list of indigenous native species). The plot is pre-prepared for the family to plant the tree, Simon or Alex is on hand should the family request help in planting the tree.  \u0026ldquoThe families who have chosen Craufurdland Woods as a resting place for their loved ones tell us they like the fact that the tree planting is sometime after the funeral as it gives them the opportunity to celebrate their loved ones continuously, long after their passing says Simon Craufurd. Security isn\u0026rsquot an issue at the burial grounds. With the gates unlocked, and right of responsible access means anyone can pass through the land. \"With no tombstones, there\u0027s not much to steal, only peace, stillness and beauty to enjoy. says Simon Craufurd.

This is one of the easiest questions to answer. It\u0026rsquos a privilege and it\u0026rsquos impossible for us to call this a job when it so intertwined in our lives. It is not a case of closing the office and leaving our work behind us. Every family we meet and help their story stays with us.  For us at McLeans, as a small family team, it is about helping every family that walks through the door and treating them as if they are one of our own. No request is either too small or too farfetched. If a bereaved family member or friend find it important, it is.  From the simplest things we can do for people, which may just be to listen or to go as far as arranging a full stable of horses, if it is going to bring them some comfort we will always strive to meet there needs.  All this has been learned from Chris, Dad and Papa to us. He always taught us to have an open heart and the importance of people\u0026rsquos lives.

President Quim Torra, who backs independence for the region, was sworn in by Catalonia\u0027s parliament in May.  He is due to arrive in Scotland on Tuesday following a meeting with Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday, according to Prof Ponsati\u0027s lawyer Aamer Anwar.  He will meet with Prof Ponsati before joining the First Minister at her official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh, on Wednesday, Mr Anwar said.  Mr Torra\u0027s visit will follow the latest procedural hearing for Prof Ponsati\u0027s case at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday this week.  It comes ahead of a four-week hearing scheduled to take place in the summer.  Prof Ponsati\u0027s legal team, who describe the prosecution as \"politically motivated\" by Spain, say she could face a total sentence of up to 33 years if she is sent there and convicted of the charges, raising fears the 61-year-old could spend the rest of her life in jail.  Her team maintains that the condition of \"dual criminality\" - the issue of establishing equivalent charges in Scots law - is not fulfilled, and a European arrest warrant should not be executed.  However Mr Anwar said the Advocate Depute, acting on behalf of Spain, has advised she faces the equivalent charge of treason in Scots law.  He said: \"Clara Ponsati maintains her innocence of the charges and our instructions remain to robustly defend her from extradition to Spain.  \"Clara regards it as surreal that she is now accused of treason, when the Spanish state blames the Catalan government for executing a law that was voted on in the Catalan Parliament elected by the Catalan people.  \"From the very beginning we have submitted that the condition of dual criminality is not fulfilled in Scotland, and the European arrest warrants should not be executed.\"  READ MORE: \u0027Scotland\u0027s independence day is coming soon\u0027, says Ian Blackford  A Crown Office spokesman said: \"In extradition cases in Scotland, the Crown is required by statute to act on behalf of the requesting state or territory.  \"Once proceedings are active, any question as to the progress of the case is a matter for the court.

Producers are warning that Scotland\u0026rsquos staple potato crop - already behind thanks to late and deep snow - will struggle in soil baked by weeks of sun and dried out by the wind.  But the same weather threatening our chips and crisps is great for our berries. Farmers are talking about a bumper crop of soft fruit - provided they can find the labour to pick it.  There are real worries, however, about supplies of fodder going in to next winter with Scotland potentially facing a shortage of straw. Some farmers, insiders warn, may have to sacrifice less productive cattle for mince if feedstock prices rise.  Andrew McCornick, president of the National Farmers Union in Scotland, explained the very mixed picture brought for the sector.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis year started with a long and expensive winter, caused by a combination of poor weather and a hangover from the previous year\u0026rsquos difficult harvest.  \u0026ldquoMany farmers and crofters found themselves chasing their tails for the whole of the winter and most of the spring.  \u0026ldquoFrom an arable perspective, the delays in sowing and crop husbandry during the difficult winter and spring, on top of the delays caused by a poor harvest last year, mean that the true effects of the weather will not be truly known until after this year\u0026rsquos harvest.  \u0026ldquoThe recent dry spell has been a welcome relief for many of our members who, after suffering a dreadful 12 months of weather previously, have had an opportunity to cut hay and silage, graze livestock outdoors, and generally enjoy the simple pleasures of working outside in good weather.  The upside is that the winter fodder harvested so far is good but farmers will be watching the weather carefully to see how much hay they have. They may not be able to swap straw for hay if the grass does not grow well.    Scottish arable farmers used to have so much straw left after they gathered their barley that they burnt it. Now many mash the stalks back in to the ground - even as demand from power generators for the product rises.  But Mr McCornick and other experts have been warning there may not be a lot of straw left this year, for both food and bedding.  He said: \u0026ldquoStraw supplies look like they may become an issue later on in the year and we are encouraging those who will need straw to negotiate a reasonable price sooner rather than later. \u0026ldquo  \u0026ldquoI am always wary when discussing the downside of warm weather in Scotland, as it is such a rarity. That being said, many parts will be hoping for a spot of rain. A little bit of moisture would be a great help to grass growth and for those who are relying on a second cut of silage, as well as our arable members who will be looking for some wet weather to swell grain as we quickly approach harvest time.  There may not be much straw but there is plenty of strawberries, which boom in the sushine.  Mr McCornick said: \u0026ldquoEarly reports on the soft fruit harvest suggests exceptional quality, the hot weather fuelling excellent demand and packhouses at full throttle.  Farmers last month reported a glut of the fruit. Aldi, the discount supermarket, took 80 tonnes of extra deliveries and started selling them in bigger punnets.  The crash in the pound means Scottish farmers are struggling to attract pickers from eastern Europe to bring in their harvest. Producers have raised wages and offered signing-on bonuses as workers fail to materialise.  Some farmers in Scotland may benefit from smaller crops of other produce, including English lettuce wilting in high temperatures, meaning lower labour requirements. There are concerns over other products too, including courgettes. Some growers expect supermarket shortages of greens within the next two weeks.  Growers of potatoes and salad crops need water right now as the plants, delayed by the Beast from the East, move in the period when they should bulk up.  Ayrshire new potatoes arrived in the shops a fortnight later than usual as spring arrived late and the March deep cold frosted off young plants. Yields in Ayrshire were down about 10 per cent, according to figures from earlier this month. Crops further south, which appear earlier, were affected even more seriously. Prices are not expected to compensate farmers for smaller crops.  Ice-cream sales, meanwhile, continue to boom, with or without strawberries. Britain may spend as much as a \u0026pound1 billion this year.  Sales across the British Isles are understood to have doubled Waitrose said customers had bought a record number of children\u0026rsquos lollies, up 175 per cent. Adult lollies, it said, grew even faster, by 188 per cent.  The Aberdeenshire ice cream maker Mackie\u0026rsquos said its sales were up more than a quarter from May last year. It sold the equivalent of 1.1m scoops in the month, enough for every man, woman and child in Glasgow to have one each. The business also said sales of ice were roaring."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-independence-day-is-coming-soon-blackford","story":"  The SNP\u0027s Westminster leader warned the Conservative Party\u0027s treatment of Scotland would accelerate separation, as he told of \"real anger\" among Scots at seeing Holyrood and their rights being \"attacked\" by the UK Government.  Mr Blackford reiterated fears over Scottish Parliament powers being taken away via Brexit legislation, which has resulted in ongoing parliamentary skirmishes in Westminster between the parties.  At one stage, Speaker John Bercow urged MPs to \"lower the temperature\" due to the ferocity of the heckling and shouting in the chamber.  The SNP\u0027s motion urges the Commons to endorse the principles of the Claim of Right for Scotland and acknowledge the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of government \"best suited to their needs\".  Leading the debate, Mr Blackford said: \"Is it very fitting today, Mr Speaker, that the Scottish National Party uses our opposition day (debate) on July 4 - independence day (in the United States) - to defend the interests and the rights and the will of the Scottish people?\"  After being heckled by a Scottish Tory MP, Mr Blackford said: \"Listen, it might not be independence day to you but I\u0027ll tell you this - the way the Conservative Party is treating Scotland, our independence day is coming and it\u0027s coming soon.\"  Labour\u0027s Ian Murray (Edinburgh South), intervening, said: \"You say Scotland\u0027s independence is coming... the Scottish people did have a vote in 2014 and they agreed to stay in the United Kingdom.\"  Mr Blackford said there had been a change in circumstances, including Scotland\u0027s desire to stay in the EU while the UK Government wants to ignore them and \"drive us\" out of Europe.  He also railed against the \"biggest power grab\" conducted by Westminster since devolution in 1999, in a nod to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act, which transfers EU law into UK law.  Only about 19 minutes were left for debate on devolution changes linked to the legislation when MPs considered amendments made by the House of Lords last month.  The Scottish Parliament did not grant a legislative consent motion for the key Brexit legislation, prompting claims the Sewel Convention had been ignored.  This is the precedent that Westminster must have the consent of Holyrood to legislate on devolved matters.  The UK Government has previously said the Act delivers \"significant further powers\" to the Scottish Parliament, and it would seek consent unless there are \"not normal circumstances applying\" - describing Brexit as such an exception.  Mr Blackford said \"unknown territory\" had been entered and urged the UK Government to bring forward legislation that protects the Scottish Parliament\u0027s powers.  He added: \"If (Scottish Secretary David Mundell) recognises his role in defending devolution he should do so.  \"A failure to do that should mean, quite frankly, he should resign because he is not standing up for the interests of Scotland.\"  Scottish Secretary David Mundell later said the SNP were guilty of \"power-grab scaremongering, hot air and grandstanding stunts\".  He said: \"All we have now is manufactured grievances, they invent, they misrepresent, they abuse, they try to shout down those who disagree with them, they glory in childish stunts which embarrass the people they purport to represent.\"  Earlier Mr Mundell told MPs the debate told the public \"everything about the SNP and their obsession with independence\".  He said: \"They\u0027re like a broken record, it\u0027s less than two years since Parliament debated a claim of right at the behest of the SNP.  \"Of course in the intervening time we have had an electoral test in Scotland, a General Election, the result as I recall it was the SNP losing 21 seats and 12 Conservative gains.  \"That debate was a charade then, an excuse to talk about independence and it\u0027s a charade today.\""},{"url":null,"title":"fresh-pressure-on-pm-over-brexit-deal-ahead-of-crunch-cabinet-talks","story":"  With little more than a day to go before senior ministers meet in Buckinghamshire to thrash out a white paper, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) warned that a \u0026ldquobad deal could cost it \u0026pound1.2 billion every year.  It follows similar warnings in recent weeks from Airbus and BMW who have voiced concerns about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on UK jobs and investment.  As the same time, Brexit Secretary David Davis is reported to have told the Prime Minister that her \u0026ldquothird way plan to solve the customs issue on the Irish border was unworkable.  The Prime Minister is trying to find a compromise that will secure support from both wings of her Cabinet on Friday, but critics called for the Government to maintain its red lines on leaving the single market and customs union.  A group of more than 40 Eurosceptic Tories met Chief Whip Julian Smith on Wednesday to air their concerns about the prospect of a soft Brexit which would restrict the UK\u0026rsquos freedom to diverge from EU rules in future.  Mrs May heads to Berlin for talks on subjects including Brexit with Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday, leaving behind a bitterly divided party and Government.  The intervention from JLR saw it warn of \u0026ldquoan unpredictable future for it and its suppliers without \u0026ldquofree and frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market.  Chief executive Dr Ralf Speth, said: \u0026ldquoWe urgently need greater certainty to continue to invest heavily in the UK and safeguard our suppliers, customers and 40,000 British-based employees.  \u0026ldquoA bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than \u0026pound1.2 billion profit each year.  \u0026ldquoAs a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile. We have spent around \u0026pound50 billion in the UK in the past five years, with plans for a further \u0026pound80 billion more in the next five.  \u0026ldquoThis would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.  The Daily  reported that Mr Davis had written to Mrs May, arguing that her new plan to reconcile warring factions over customs arrangements would be rejected out of hand by the EU.  In an attempt to address concerns, Mrs May said at Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions the Government would ensure \u0026ldquowe are out of the customs union, that we are out of the single market, that we are out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, we are out of the Common Agricultural Policy, we are out of the Common Fisheries Policy, we bring an end to free movement, we take control of our borders, we have an independent trade policy.  Her comments came after Jacob Rees-Mogg hit out at reports suggesting the meeting of Cabinet ministers at Chequers would be asked to support close continued alignment on rules for goods and tariffs.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hard to think of a worse idea, he told the BBC\u0026rsquos Daily Politics.  Adopting EU tariffs would be \u0026ldquoabandoning the benefit of Brexit and \u0026ldquoa really foolish policy because it would curtail the UK\u0026rsquos ability to strike its own trade deals.  Asked if he would be prepared to rebel if the Cabinet\u0026rsquos conclusions at Chequers were unacceptable to him, Mr Rees-Mogg said: \u0026ldquoIf the agreement from the Cabinet is that we will give the EU \u0026pound39 billion merely on good faith of the EU\u0026rsquos negotiating a trade deal, I will vote against that. I don\u0026rsquot think I can be clearer than that.

The subsequent meeting with the Chief Whip was used by the ERG MPs to spell out their demands for the forthcoming White Paper, stressing that there must be no watering down of the position set out in the Conservative manifesto.  There was also widespread concern among the MPs about the role being played by Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Europe adviser and the senior official involved in negotiations with Brussels.

A group of nerve agents which are more potent and lethal than VX or sarin.  They are made of two separate non-toxic substances that work as a nerve agent when brought together.  Dr Andrea Sella, professor of inorganic chemistry at University College London, said: \u0026ldquoNovichok is not really very different from all the classics, you\u0026rsquove got the same basic chemical framework at the heart of it.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not sure it\u0026rsquos ever really been used. There\u0026rsquos not much experience of seeing these things, they would have recognised it was some sort of nerve agent, which is part of the reason for the delay [in identifying it].  \u0026ndash Why was it created?  Novichok, which means newcomer in Russian, was developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s as a new kind of chemical weapon that would be harder to detect, more potent than existing nerve agents and exempt from the Chemical Weapons Treaty.  Dr Sella said: \u0026ldquoNovichok agents are ones that were kept very quiet by the Russians and developed to try and gain advantage against the more conventional things they knew Western governments had.  \u0026ndash How does it work?  Novichok and other nerve agents attack the nervous system and stop chemical messages getting around the body.  They cause the heart to slow down and airways to become constricted, leading to suffocation or brain damage.  \u0026ldquoIt must be excruciatingly painful and unbelievably violent, Dr Sella said.  \u0026ldquoYou have very painful muscle contractions, vision goes pretty quickly and what little you can see is blurred, then you can\u0026rsquot breathe.  \u0026ndash What are the symptoms?  Nerve agents, including Novichok, can be inhaled as a fine powder, absorbed through the skin or ingested.  Symptoms can start within seconds or minutes of being exposed and include convulsions, paralysis, respiratory failure and death.  \u0026ndash How can it be treated?  The treatment for nerve agents is to administer an antidote immediately, but some of the damage from the chemical and oxygen starvation can be irreparable.  It is not known if there is an antidote available for Novichok."},{"url":null,"title":"amazon-named-best-uk-organisation-for-customer-satisfaction","story":"  Iceland beat Aldi and Waitrose to be named the highest performing supermarket and is the only food retailer in the top 10, having climbed 26 places in the last six months in the UK Customer Satisfaction Index published by the Institute of Customer Service.  Amazon took top place for the sixth consecutive time in the biannual survey with a score of 86.7 points out of 100, only just ahead of John Lewis on 86.5 and Next and Yorkshire Bank, both on 86.1.  Yorkshire Bank was one of four financial institutions to make the top 10 alongside first direct, Nationwide and M\u0026ampS Bank.  The banking sector overall performed better than ever before, reaching a score of 80.4 and exceeding the overall average score of 77.9.  However, the index shows a slight fall in overall customer satisfaction after a peak in 2012/13.  The Institute warned that the difficult retail environment meant that survival would be driven by how well customers were served.  The index rates customer satisfaction across 13 sectors based on the views of 10,000 consumers.  More than 30 different customer measures are surveyed, such as staff professionalism, the quality and efficiency of the service, trust and transparency, the actual customer experience and complaint handling.  Jo Causon, chief executive of the Institute for Customer Service, said: \u0026ldquoThe stagnation in customer service levels should be of concern for the UK economy.  \u0026ldquoThis comes at a time when, just nine months from Brexit, we need more than ever before to show that Britain is a great place to do business with and in.  \u0026ldquoAlongside tangible financial measures, trust, reputation and recommendation are crucial benefits of a deliberate and consistent focus on achieving high levels of customer satisfaction.  \u0026ldquoThe UKCSI shows that customers who give the highest ratings for customer satisfaction express strong levels of loyalty, which brands will need in difficult and unpredictable market conditions.

This ungracious, unkind, generally beelin\u0026rsquo 50 per cent of the population (Mori Polls don\u0026rsquot confirm these stats but my Whattsap comments don\u0026rsquot lie) simply refused to accept England had been the better, less criminally active team who deserved to beat the team known not entirely affectionately as \u0026ldquoEscobar\u0026rsquos Eleven.  But where\u0026rsquos the connection with Love Island, the paradise created by ITV producers in order to seize the summer ratings I hear you wonder? It\u0026rsquos schadenfreude. It\u0026rsquos the ugly desire to see those who do us no real harm suffer.  This week in Love Island, the drama unfolded when Dani Dyer, whose dad happens to be the famous Eastender (who so neatly summed up David Cameron last week as being a \u0026ldquotwit, give or take a vowel), saw her sunshine smile wiped off her face by a bucket of freezing, dirty rainwater in the form of a bad news.  The show\u0026rsquos producers decided to up the watching ante by having her new love\u0026rsquos ex girlfriend parachuted onto Love Island, (figuratively) then led Ms Dyer to believe her beau was enjoying Biblical relations with the ex. (Unknown to the TV star\u0026rsquos gel, her hunk was being a perfect gent.)  As a result, Dani Dyer broke her heart on national television, and ratings soared. Now, the success of the show is predicated upon viewers looking on vicariously to see couples coupling, but a great many love to see the beautiful bodied come unstuck. And schadenfreude is a sport we Scots excel in. Gore Vidal\u0026rsquos maxim \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not enough that I succeed, others have to fail, is in our DNA.  Yes, there is the argument that those who enter the likes of Love Island should know there is no such thing as a free holiday. Over the years the reality format has excelled in creating conflict Sylvester Stallone\u0026rsquos mother entering the Big Brother house, Richard Blackwood\u0026rsquos Celebrity Detox demanding contestants reveal the contents of their colonic irrigation, which meant this literally was s*** TV. And we can go back to Channel 4\u0026rsquos The Word, to recall a segment \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod do anything for fame, in which one week a teenager proved this point by snogging an 80 year-old toothless granny.  But those who arrive on Love Island don\u0026rsquot always see this coming. They\u0026rsquore part of the selfie generation whose purpose in life is to look great, get an advertising deal and meet another self-absorbed narcissist. That may not be up there with finding a cure for cancer, but that\u0026rsquos no reason for taking pleasure at watching someone\u0026rsquos mind unravel like a ball of wool attacked by a manic cat.  Why do we Scots find it so much easier to trash others\u0026rsquo success or fame? It\u0026rsquos because we\u0026rsquore not, (even though we like to think we are) a confident nation. We\u0026rsquore not big enough to applaud success. This is partly down to the fact Scotland has a long had a strong egalitarian notion, but this fosters the idea that no-one is special, that we should all be trapped on the lower level. Scotland\u0026rsquos Centre for Confidence and Wellbeing suggests that paradoxically, in a society where people do not set out equal in life, our instilled sense of egalitarianism actually reinforces class (and gender) inequality.    There\u0026rsquos another reason for us not being confident. Strong Labour and Calvanistic conditioning has told us we shouldn\u0026rsquot draw attention to ourselves. And it is conditioning. You aren\u0026rsquot born with alack of self-worth, as the song from South Pacific, You\u0026rsquove Got To Be Carefully Taught, underlines. \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquove got to be taught before it\u0026rsquos too late. Before you are six or seven or eight. To hate all the people your relatives hate. You\u0026rsquove got to be carefully taught.  What\u0026rsquos clear is we have national low self-esteem issues. We have not become Europe\u0026rsquos worst drug abusers for no reason. But in being too quick to criticise success, or deride those who achieve fame, for whatever reason, we perpetuate this cycle of astonishingly heavy criticism, while reducing our own possibilities. In that sense, we need to be less Scottish.  But there\u0026rsquos some hope. As far as Love Island is concerned, Ofcom has received 2500 complaints about the treatment of Dani Dyer. It would be nice to think some of them came from Scotland. When England marched around Celtic Park before the Commonwealth Games of 2014 they got the biggest cheer of the night, apart from Scotland. And half of the Columbia match Whatsapps were supportive of England, which wouldn\u0026rsquot have been the case a decade ago.  So let\u0026rsquos analyse ourselves. If we don\u0026rsquot want England to win has it anything to do with the Act of Union, or years or perceived subjugation? Or more to do with the fact we can\u0026rsquot beat Slovakia to qualify?

Around 40 Tory MPs reportedly warned chief whip Julian Smith their party would be \u0026ldquotoast if the Prime Minister abandoned her Brexit red lines.  The third way is understood to involve the UK collecting EU import tariffs, a central plank of the supposedly abandoned \u0026ldquocustoms partnership model, which Boris Johnson dismissed as \u0026ldquocrazy.

Threatening to denounce the JMC as a joke if nothing charged, they added: \u0026ldquoIf we do not have this opportunity, we will have to make it very clear that we have been given no real possibility to consider, let alone influence the content of a document which will purport to speak on behalf of the whole of the United Kingdom, about matters, many of which are devolved... of the greatest possible importance to the people of Scotland and Wales.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds.

That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is simply not acceptable.Whatever the outstanding disagreement there may be between the government and commercial operators, Mr McArthur feels that people in Orkney have every right to expect both sides to get this sorted without delay.\u0026#8220The Transport Secretary also needs to confirm that the fare reductions, once agreed, will be backdated to 30 June, in keeping with the firm promises made by his predecessor and the First Minister,\u0026#8221 he said.“This sorry saga has rumbled on for far too long.

wildflowers.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiative is being led by Scottish Natural Heritage to tackle alien species.Lynn McKelvey, Cromarty Firth Fishery Board project officer, said: \"Here at Garrie Island, in the River Conon, we have fantastic wet alder woodland, which is designated as being important at both a UK and European level.\"However, the woodland habitat has been under threat from invasive species, particularly Himalayan balsam, which spreads so quickly growing in dense stands, meaning no native wildflowers can grow.\"Head teacher Tania Mackie said: \"Outdoor learning is fundamental to the curriculum at Ben Wyvis Primary School, as is working with local partners.\"We are delighted to be working with Cromarty Firth Fishery Board and the SISI project.\"Not only are the children being supported by experts, but the pupils of Ben Wyvis Primary are also learning about their local environment.\"Learning in context is a valuable experience for all our young people and as a school we are encouraging our young people to step beyond the classroom, whilst developing the young workforce\".Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham praised volunteers for the vital role they

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to. Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos nieces and nephews from as far afield as the Canary Islands, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Sussex headed north for the event.Her birthday cake, baked by a relative, was shaped as an artist\u0026rsquos palette to represent one of her great passions in life.Mrs Foster was born in Surrey and spent her childhood with her three siblings in Kent, where her father had a grocery business.She started her working life in an office at a department store and then worked as a secretary mainly with legal firms, in England and Edinburgh.Mrs Foster said she and her husband Tony had been \"gradually moving up the country\" before settling in their cottage in Muir of Ord. Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not! I\u0026rsquove lived a normal sort of life and I\u0026rsquove been lucky, particularly with my health.\"In recent years she has taken up using an iPad, can send emails and enjoys playing Candy Crush.Exhibition and sale days at The Muir Hub, which is on Great North Road, will be staged until\u0026nbspThursday between 9.30am and 4pm.Thursday 5 Jul 2018 6:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A number of new schools have been built, which is brilliant for the pupils and communities that benefit.\"Despite receiving more funding than nearly all other local authorities, Highland Council still has the worst school estate in Scotland.\"The funding recognises the rurality of Highland Council, but most schools have been built in more densely populated areas like Inverness.

She added that Scottish Schools for the Future funding was welcome but added that current levels of funding from Holyrood are \"simply not enough to adequately invest in our schools\".She urged the Scottish Government to provide funding levels which recognise the unique challenges facing the Highlands, \"and in particular the very large number of schools, many of which are smaller schools, requiring urgent investment\".And she called for it to consider capacity pressures when allocating funding.\"If Kate Forbes wants to help Highland schools, then she should support our asks from government.\"Thursday 5 Jul 2018 6:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762978.1530605465!/image/image.jpg","title":"darren mcgarvey i m struggling to cope with success","story":"\t\tAbscesses, insomnia and migraines - Orwell Prize winner Darren McGarvey writes candidly about his mental and emotional struggle with success.\t\t\t\tIt’s 1.38 on Monday morning and, in an abandoned hotel foyer at the Holiday Inn Express in Stratford, I am about to start writing my column. I’m so tired I could cry. \u2028In the morning, we’re taking my son to Thomas The Tank Engine Land and we decided to drive down on Sunday evening to avoid the traffic.             I don’t want to have to work on what should be the first day of a family holiday, which means pulling an all-nighter, so I can file without missing quality time with my children.            This time last week, I was in another hotel in London. The week before that, Edinburgh. Or was it Salford? Or Dundee? It’s hard to say, if I’m honest. The workload has fried my brain to the point I often cannot recall the prior day’s events when asked what I’ve been up to. I feel like I am losing my mind. Every day bleeds into the next, with no respite in sight. But complaining about the fact I feel like I am on the cliff-edge of a mental health crisis seems utterly futile because, from the outside, it appears I am enjoying wonderful, unprecedented success. Success for which I ought to be grateful.Of course, I am grateful. If anything, I am in a state of permanent disbelief about what is going on. The truth is I haven’t had a minute to reflect on or even savour anything that has happened since November last year when the publication of my book began a chain of events that culminated, last Monday, in being awarded the coveted Orwell Prize.More people than ever seem to want to speak to me, for different reasons. Some just want to say, “well done” and others want to share their stories. Some want to me to come and visit their projects and others want to buy the film and TV rights to my life story.             I did some business in London last week that will make your eyes bulge out of their sockets when its announced, yet somehow, in this haze of physical and emotional exasperation, nothing feels real. I don’t even feel real.READ MORE: Scotsman columnist Darren McGarvey wins Orwell Prize for political writingPeople love a good rags-to-riches story. Hell, I know I do. But imagine how surreal it feels when you become the centre of one. You are suddenly inundated with requests, calls, offers and correspondence, without any frame of reference for what is going on. It’s incredibly disorientating and sometimes frightening, if I’m honest. But there is rarely an opportunity to express that truth, because you are always being prompted to describe how it feels to become “successful”. People want to hear a specific story. The story about a diamond in the rough, escaping poverty, surviving neglect and abuse to become an award-winning author. People are less interested in what it took to get into this position.             The fact I am struggling mentally and emotionally is even less interesting. The details about my cluster migraines, abscesses and insomnia are met with looks of confusion, as people instinctively attempt to direct me away from what I want to say and back to the “narrative”: my capitalist hero-journey. They don’t want to hear about the thousands I’ve spent on hotels, trains and flights, travelling this island by myself, with a heavy bag over my shoulder and a box of books under my arm, literally selling hand-to-hand. The hundreds of books I’ve purchased with my own money, to sign and post all over the world to plug gaping holes in my finances. They don’t want to hear about the anxiety attacks I often experience as notifications flood my devices or the fear I suffer every time I give an interview to a newspaper or broadcaster. Nobody cares that I live in constant dread that I will misspeak on a sensitive issue and become a target for people online. Nobody is interested in me describing what it feels like to come home after weeks of being on the road, to find my two-year old sitting with his back to me – his way of letting me know he isn’t pleased with my absence. I haven’t made a penny off my book yet. I am living off advances. But any time I try to express that these overwhelming mundanities – and not the successes – are what currently consume every moment of my waking life, I feel the weight of other people’s expectations bearing down on me. READ MORE: Darren McGarvey: Journalists must leave their ivory towers to gain respect            To the extent that I am learning it’s best to simply conceal the reality of my life, or risk appearing ungrateful or worse, spoiling the vicarious thrill others might experience when they enquire, “how does it feel?”I don’t know how it feels. I haven’t had a minute to take anything in. I run around like a mad-man, I fall asleep somewhere, and I wake up and do it all again. Every. Single. Day. No matter who I speak to, my constant refrain – that I am in urgent need of rest and fear I may be heading for a fall – never seems to be heard. The only thing I haven’t been offered in the last seven days is a good night’s sleep. I feel obligated to so many people, for different reasons, that my own needs fall to the bottom of the hierarchy of concern. My problems are marked as low-priority and so must remain hidden, revealed only in late-night social media outbursts when I feel trapped on Scotland’s decrepit public transportation network.All I need is a few days where I am not expected to do anything. Where I am not obligated to speak to anybody. Where I can gather my thoughts and rejuvenate after two years of non-stop, high-pressure work, couched in constant financial insecurity and stress. Anybody getting any ideas that I’m too far removed from the working class to write about it, ought to refer to my seven-day-a-week schedule for proof that I am more working class now than I ever was – with no holiday entitlement. It’s 3.10am. The kids will be up in four hours.

If the UK cannot decide what it wants, it will end up getting exactly what they want. Politicians of all parties need to realise the old fault lines do not apply on this issue and that, for the sake of the nation, they must form an ad hoc ‘national coalition of the sensible’ to secure a Brexit deal that will outrage the hardliners but save the economy from disaster.READ MORE: Lesley Riddoch: Doomsday report exposes Brexit vulnerability"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4763516.1530642722!/image/image.jpg","title":"professor john elliott what scots and catalans can learn from history","story":"\t\tRelations between Catalonia and Madrid soured in the 1800s as the Romantic Movement took off and inspired a new kind of nationalism, writes John Elliott.\t\t\t\tAs the current generation of Scots and Catalans face up to unusually agonising decisions about the future they want for themselves and their children, it is perhaps salutary to take a step back and consider how and why this dilemma has arisen.            This is what I have tried to do in my book, Scots and Catalans. Union and Disunion, a comparative  history of two peoples without states of their own, whose attempts to define, reassess and perhaps transform their relationship to the larger polities to which they belong has been drawing headlines across the world.             The book begins with the Middle Ages and ends in December 2017 after the flight to Belgium of the Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, following the failure of a unilateral bid to break away from the Spanish state and establish Catalonia as an independent republic.Many years ago I wrote a study of the origins of the Catalan rebellion of 1640 against the royal government in Madrid – a rebellion that inspired the creation of a Catalan republic which lasted for a week. As I contemplated the unfolding of today’s Catalan separatist movement and the simultaneous rise of Scottish separatism, I thought it might be illuminating to attempt a sustained comparison of the historical experience of the two countries and of the ways in which a sense of national identity has manifested itself over the centuries.READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Stop treating Catalonia as a proxy for ScotlandNaturally there are important differences between the two national histories, but differences can be as revealing as similarities in reaching historical conclusions. One obvious difference is that Scotland was for centuries an independent kingdom, whereas Catalonia was never a truly independent state. It was a principality that formed part of a federation, the Crown of Aragon, which was united with the Crown of Castile as a result of the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile in 1469. This dynastic union created the country that came to be known as ‘Spain’. Dynastic union between Scotland and England came more than a century later, when James VI of Scotland’s inheritance of the English throne in 1603 created ‘Great Britain’.  The immediate effect of these unions was similar, in the sense that, although both Scotland and Catalonia preserved their traditional forms of government, they were now linked to a far more powerful neighbour. This produced inevitable tensions, and at the start of the 18th century attempts were made to resolve them, although in very different ways. The 1707 Anglo-Scottish Union created a British parliamentary monarchy, in which the Scots surrendered their Edinburgh parliament in exchange for access to England’s expanding commercial and colonial empire.             In 1716, following the surrender of Barcelona two years earlier to the forces of Philip V, who was the monarch of the newly enthroned Bourbon dynasty, Catalonia, like the rest of the Crown of Aragon, was stripped of its traditional laws and liberties, and was merged into what became an authoritarian monarchical Spain.Scotland and Catalonia both benefited economically from the constitutional changes of the early 18th century, although the expansion of Britain’s overseas empire gave the Scots many more opportunities than those enjoyed by the Catalans. The British empire of the 18th and 19th centuries was a joint Anglo-Scottish creation, whereas the Catalans remained on the margins of Spain’s long-established American empire. Instead, they turned their energies to economic development, and became the pioneers of Spanish industrialisation, based on a rapidly growing textile industry. READ MORE: Brian Wilson: Catalonia is evidence of the benefits of a UnionScotland, too, was being transformed by the growth of its industries in the same period, but, unlike Catalonia, it never became the main power-house of the wider, national, economy. The long-term effect of these differences is still to be seen. In Spain, economic and political development were out of kilter in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While Madrid was the country’s political capital, its economic capital was Barcelona. In Britain, London was both.            In the 19th century, Catalonia’s relationship with the government in Madrid soured. This was partly the result of Spain’s chronic political instability in the decades following the Napoleonic invasion and the Peninsular War. But it can also be explained by a pan-European phenomenon, the emergence of a new-style nationalism inspired by the Romantic Movement. The researches of historians, literary scholars and folklorists into the origins of their societies generated a sense of the nation as an organic community with its own distinctive characteristics. Such explorations of the Catalan past helped produce another significant difference between Scotland and Catalonia. It was language that became the point of reference for national identity in Catalonia, in a way that Gaelic would never be for that of Scotland. The Catalans clung to their language when the repressive regime of General Franco sought to replace it with Castilian, the predominant language of Spain. After Franco’s death in 1975, a reaction was inevitable. The autonomous Catalan regime created by the 1978 Constitution of the newly democratic Spain was determined, through its control of the educational system, to ‘Catalanise’ Catalan society in the face of the encroachment of Castilian through the national media. The resulting linguistic question has played a large part in creating the current impasse between Catalonia and the Spanish government.It is one of the ironies of this stand-off that the 30 years between 1978 and the financial collapse of 2008 have been the most prosperous and successful in Catalonia’s colourful history. But the economic crisis gave radical Catalan nationalists a chance to depict Catalonia as the victim of a malign Spanish state, and the inflexibility of a Spanish government determined to treat the secessionist movement as a constitutional question that should properly be left to the courts handed the separatists a propaganda victory that they have exploited to the full. Referendums, whether authorised or unauthorised, as in the Catalan case, are at best blunt instruments for determining the will of the people. In forcing binary choices they can be deeply divisive, and Catalonia is now a bitterly divided society, in which intimidation is being exercised by secessionists who claim to speak for all its inhabitants. A highly creative people with a long and distinguished history, the Catalans deserve better than this.

So it is a shame that Mr Yousaf continues to play the same tired old games, even after the commendable efforts of councillors and MSPs of all parties and none has secured at least some action towards correcting this patently unfair situation.\nThe transport minister is right in congratulating the island councils for their tenacity in pursuing this issue. It\u0026#8217s just a shame it was the actions – or inactions – of his SNP government which forced them to be so tenacious.\nAnd what is now abundantly clear is that, in spite of the SNP\u0026#8217s protests, the money was always available to address this issue. The SNP managed to magic up an extra £170 million yesterday which, apparently, they didn\u0026#8217t have when the budget was first presented. So the question many in the Northern Isles should be asking Mr Yousaf is why didn\u0026#8217t the SNP include fair funding in their draft budget in the first place?\nWhen SNP ministers were trying to dismiss fair funding, I was regularly questioning them in the Scottish Parliament on their commitment. I was meeting with representatives from the island councils – in Lerwick, in Kirkwall and in Edinburgh.\nI put forward the amendment which, accepted by the entire Scottish Parliament (including Mr Yousaf and the SNP), recognised the lifeline nature of our internal ferries. And I wrote to Mr Yousaf and to his boss, Nicola Sturgeon, on the issue.\nSo I suppose it is flattering that, of all the opposition MSPs who voted against the SNP Budget, Mr Yousaf has chosen to single me out in this way for his faux outrage. I would suggest it\u0026#8217s an indication of the effectiveness of my consistent and vocal opposition to the SNP\u0026#8217s attempt to sweep its own fair funding pledge under the carpet.\nAnd in relation to the vote itself, Mr Yousaf seems intent on misleading Shetlanders. The truth is that MSPs do not vote on individual parts of the budget, but rather on the budget as a whole.\nSo, even with the late U-turn on additional ferry funding, this budget remains, overall, a disappointing budget for people and businesses in Shetland. It will mean that many of my constituents – in fact, anyone earning over £26,000 per year – will pay more tax.\nIt will hit the incomes of local people and businesses, something numerous business organisations have warned will harm Scotland\u0026#8217s already sluggish economic growth. And it leaves our local councils across the region still having to make tough spending decisions. So it is for those local and regional MSPs who supported the SNP\u0026#8217s budget to defend their decision. I simply wasn\u0026#8217t prepared to back a budget which will leave too many local people out of pocket.\nAnd an inconvenient fact Mr Yousaf, too busy patting himself on the back for belatedly delivering something even the SNP in Orkney accept was always an SNP commitment, choses to ignore is that this is only a deal for this year and not a long term solution. So the real risk is that we will have to go through this process all over again for next year\u0026#8217s budget.\nI hope next year, the SNP will deliver a long term settlement on fair funding, not another one off. That a long-term solution will be found that will meet the needs of the local communities so reliant on these lifeline links. And that Mr Yousaf, Derek Mackay and the SNP will avoid the political theatrics that have dominated this year\u0026#8217s budget process.\n Edinburgh.\n If all politicians behaved in this manner it is likely that every budget in every parliament would fail, even though every single clause had enthusiastic and popular local backing no one was willing to support the package as a whole.\n Clearly these are not the section of his constituents Mr Halcro \u0026#8211 Johnston is interested in.\n The tartan Tories are living up to their name for sure and their blind supporters still try to defend them.\nMr Halcrow objects to political parties playing games?\n\nWhich party does Christopher \u0026#8216up-skirting\u0026#8217 Chope belong to again?\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"6 herrisdale park tingwal ","story":"Offers over £145,000\n nursery.\nIn addition to the two double bedrooms, the accommodation includes a single bedroom, dining kitchen, livingroom, shower room and separate toilet.

The skipper handled the situation extremely well.”\nThe 40-year-old converted fishing boat, with an all-female crew and female passengers, was heading to Shetland for a diving trip, and will be in the isles for the next few weeks.\n since January last year and has 22 years experience as a power boat instructor, said she called the coastguard as a precaution.\n was [originally] a fishing boat and well able for the conditions.”\nThe problem started when the boat began taking in water from the rudder gland and a deck hatch, she said. The boat was equipped with a three bilge-pump system but one of the pumps had failed, meaning they only had one as back-up. Ms Weaver said: “We try to be two failures away from a problem.” Also, she said, she had to “err on the side of caution” because the boat was carrying 12 passengers.\n was able to proceed “under her own power and pumping under her own power” into Lerwick. She is currently in the small boat harbour.\n and two sunken klondykers.\n is used for various types of dive trips, including recreational and wreck diving in locations in Orkney and Shetland, including Scapa Flow and Fair Isle as well as in northern Scotland and Faroe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]
