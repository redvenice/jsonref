Smollett\u0027s bond was set last week by Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke (pictured).

The leader of the European Research Group writes that the Northern Ireland backstop in its current form would last indefinitely and needs to be changed The Northern Ireland backstop has always been the biggest sticking point in the negotiations – and for a very good reason. I am as determined as anyone that the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland should remain as peaceful and problem-free as it is today.However, in its current form, the backstop – which would allow for an open border between the two countries, leaving Northern Ireland subject to certain rules of the EU\u0027s single market – would last indefinitely.May survives latest Commons showdown as hardliners start to...EU could insist on a Brexit delay of TWO YEARS if May\u0027s deal...Share this articleThe whole point of leaving the EU is to take back control, not to leave the EU with the potential for lasting effective power over trade and regulations in Northern Ireland, or any other part of the UK.If this issue can be resolved, then I would be content to support the Prime Minister\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement.Geoffrey Cox, the much-respected Attorney General, is in Brussels trying to persuade the EU to agree to a legally binding date to the backstop.          Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, is trying to secure concessions on the backstop It would be wrong to jump the gun, but if he can achieve this it would mark a fundamental change to the agreement and allow Brexiteers such as me to accept it. Once we can secure a limit to the backstop, all the other imperfections in Mrs May\u0027s deal, such as continued meddling by the European Court of Justice and our continuing to pay huge sums into EU coffers, become much less problematic.The key difference is that these are all time-limited, whereas the backstop, as currently outlined, is potentially everlasting.Once a final date is put on it, our objections to the deal, like the effects of its provisions, fade away.I really do not mind what form of words the Attorney General and the EU agree on regarding the backstop – as long as it expires before the next election and has the same legal status as the deal. And I do not agree with those who say the Withdrawal Agreement has to be reopened to solve the backstop problem. It is itself an appendix to the treaty, so I would be happy with a further appendix, as this would have equal legal force.In my view, that would satisfy most of us who are worried, and it may also help those who say the Withdrawal Agreement cannot be reopened to save face. I take a practical and not a theological attitude towards these matters.Those who have suggested that I and my Conservative colleagues in the European Research Group have gone out of our way to make things difficult for the Prime Minister could not be more wrong. Our aim has consistently been to follow the commitments made in the 2017 Tory election manifesto and implicit in the 2016 referendum result.          Prime Minister Theresa May (pictured leaving Parliament this afternoon) is still determined to keep to the March 29 departure dateThat some Cabinet ministers have undermined collective responsibility and tried to thwart Mrs May is hardly our fault.The Prime Minister says it is still her fervent hope that the UK leaves the EU on March 29. I share her sentiments.If – and I stress if – she can secure the necessary assurances on the backstop I have outlined, I would be delighted to support her deal and help avoid any delay to Brexit.It is not my job to tell other Conservative MPs what to do, but I am sure many other passionate advocates of Brexit would take the same pragmatic and patriotic view.At long last, we would have delivered our promise to the 17.4 million who voted to leave the EU in June 2016.And, as soon as that happens, we Conservatives can put our differences behind us, reunite and focus on winning the next election – and keeping Jeremy Corbyn out of Number 10. "},{"url":null,"title":"Stacey Dooley criticised Labour MP David Lammy","story":"Labour MP David Lammy criticised Stacey Dooley for appearing in a Comic Relief documentary in Uganda which promotes \u0027tired and unhelpful stereotypes\u0027 and for encouraging a \u0027white saviour\u0027 complex           Dooley, 31, is currently filming with Comic Relief about neonatal clinics and malaria in Uganda          Mr Lammy did acknowledge Miss Dooley\u0027s \u0027good motives\u0027 but bemoaned the British celebrity trope of travelling to poorer parts of Africa to film Comic Relief packagesWriting on social media, Mr Lammy said: \u0027The world doesn\u0027t need anymore white saviours.

Serhii Plokhy, who won the Baillie Gifford prize for his history of the tragedy, returns to the once sought-after Soviet town‘These buildings are the tombstones of the dreams and lives that were lived here. It’s a huge cemetery of dreams, if not of people.” From the top of an old Soviet apartment block, Serhii Plokhy looks over Pripyat. “On the one hand it looks like a normal city on the other hand you see windows without glass, streets without people and town squares taken over by forests.” Now the ghost town is used by the Ukrainian army for sniper practice and has also become a tourist attraction.It’s a far cry from the Pripyat founded in 1970 to support the Soviet Union’s burgeoning nuclear industry. Then, the city had a population of 50,000 and supplied the construction workers and operators for the nearby Chernobyl plant, which opened in 1977. “The nuclear power plant was a major technological innovation at the time,” says Plokhy. “It was the way to go for the entire world, a symbol of the future of humankind.”Workers flocked to Pripyat from all over the Soviet Union. Ukraine was a sought-after place to live and the government prioritised food (scarce at the time) and facilities for “nuclear cities”. Plokhy reels off a list: cheese and decent meat theatre and literary clubs at least two discos and state-of-the-art sporting facilities.But at 1.23am on 26 April 1986 an explosion at the Chernobyl Unit Four plant changed everything for the people of Pripyat – and the entire world. The blast was due to a turbine test that went badly wrong. In his book Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy, Plokhy describes how, initially, the authorities were in denial and blamed human error in their attempts to cover up the disaster. Through meticulous research of memoirs and KGB files he shows that, while mistakes were made, the roots of the disaster lay in the Soviet system. Specifically, the authoritarian character of the Communist party and how it prioritised economic development over humanitarian and ecological concerns.We stop for lunch at a canteen for the current workers in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, the 30km area around the nuclear plant that visitors need a permit to enter. Over a meal of vegetable soup, rice and pork, rounded off by pancakes with cottage cheese, Plokhy recalls his fears that the radiation would contaminate the water supply. Now a history professor at Harvard University, back then he was 29 and living in Ukraine. “The city where I grew up is on the Dnieper. The Pripyat River, from which the city takes its name, flows into the Dnieper. Around 30 million people depend on this river for their water and there was a real concern that it would not be drinkable.” The information vacuum led to some unscientific solutions. His friends in Kiev acted on rumours that vodka could help fight radiation by holding drinking parties.For years, Plokhy’s feelings remained raw, which is why he needed time to reflect before writing the book. “I felt I was ready. I wanted to do it a little bit earlier and I started, but decided emotionally I couldn’t do it. The distance in time gives us a better scientific understanding of what happened, and more perspective. Also, we have access to archives, which we didn’t have in the 80s and 90s – including the KGB archives.”There are heroes and villains in his book. The heroic efforts of the firefighters who were brought in to lift radioactive material from the roof of the reactor stand out. Many received fatal doses of radiation in their efforts to stop the fires spreading to the other reactors. It wasn’t just the firefighters: close to 600,000 people were drafted in from all over the Soviet Union to help limit the damage caused by the explosion and the emission of radiation. Without this help, the results could have been catastrophic. In a chilling reminder, Plokhy says in his book: “If the other three reactors of the Chernobyl power plant had been damaged by the explosion of the first, then hardly any living and breathing organisms would have remained on the planet.”As we pass a ferris wheel that was completed two weeks before the explosion but never used, Plokhy says: “The authorities did the best they could. The big issue and the big problem was that they kept silent when it came to releasing information to the world and to their own people, even people here in Pripyat.” He paints the scene of the evacuation of Pripyat, a full day-and-a-half after the explosion. “It was a weekend, the farmers’ market was working two hours before the evacuation, there were weddings in the city and children were playing in the sand. After the explosion the KGB took complete control of information between the city and the rest of the world. It was top secret.”Glasnost, the political programme to accelerate openness in the USSR, later helped lift the veil of secrecy. But Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was slow to act after the nuclear disaster. “Chernobyl wasn’t his finest hour, to put it mildly. He was very much part of the old Soviet thinking. It took him two weeks to address the nation in his first and last Chernobyl speech and almost three years to visit the plant,” Plokhy says. “We shouldn’t attribute all the blame to Gorbachev, because he represented the system. Stalin only visited the frontlines of the second world war once. Soviet leaders were not supposed to go to dangerous places.”As we drive away from Chernobyl, the conversation turns to nationalism. The blast had a profound impact on the Soviet Union. It became a rallying cry for the early opposition movement in Ukraine, which mobilised around ecological issues.“Chernobyl is important for the broader history of the Soviet Union,” Plokhy says. “Ukraine’s vote for independence killed the Soviet Union. It was the second largest economy, the second largest republic. Maybe it would have happened later under different circumstances but you can’t remove Chernobyl from the story. That’s where the beginning is.”We pass more deserted houses covered in snow and swamped by the forest of birch and pine trees. We stop and look at one of only two remaining statues of Lenin in Ukraine, both of which are in the Chernobyl exclusion zone (there were once more than 5,000 statues of him in Ukraine). It’s another reminder that the zone is frozen in a Soviet time warp.Our guide brings out her radiation counter again and says that, during our seven-hour visit to the zone, we were exposed to less radiation than we would encounter on a normal two-hour plane journey. I’m not sure if this is reassuring or not, as my thoughts turn to the flight home.• Serhii Plokhy’s Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy is published by Penguin, priced £9.99.

You troggy little twit! Don’t you dare talk pigsquiffle to me, you prunty old pogswizzler!”Either that, or she would thank the child profusely for taking the time to read her latest book, Roald Dahl’s Rotsome and Repulsant Words. Ostensibly a children’s dictionary of Dahl’s insults and expletives, the book also offers a chance to explore and analyse Dahl’s creative use of language, encouraging Dahl lovers of any age to have fun playing with his naughty-sounding words.“Children and grownups alike are fascinated by words that push the boundaries a little bit – and Dahl, in his language as much as in his characters and his plots, always has a twinkle in his eye,” says Rennie. “Children are not going to get into trouble by using these words. But at the same time, they’re fun to say and they’re very powerful. I think we, as grownups, sometimes forget how much fun language can be, especially when you make words up.”Dahl created more than 300 words, she says, and sets a liberating example to anyone whose creativity with words was – or is – stifled at school: “We know from looking at children’s writing how naturally creative children are with words, how much they love chopping words up and combining them to make new words. Dahl does that, and this book encourages children to carry on doing that, to keep going with what they enjoy doing naturally with language and to be creative.”Like Lewis Carroll before him, the techniques Dahl used to invent words are built firmly on the existing traditions of the English language. For example, to make his rude “gobblefunk” easily understood by children, Dahl relies on reduplication (“ucky-mucky”), malapropisms (“tummyrot” for “tommyrot”), onomatopoeia (“whizzpopper” meaning, famously, a sound “even the Queen’s bottom makes”), portmanteau words (gruesome and rotten combine to create “rotsome”) and, most powerfully, alliterative phonaesthesia, where consonant clusters and specific sounds connote meaning to the made-up words.“Squinky squiddler” (which the giants in The BFG call something small, squashy and insignificant), “troggy little twit” (how the giants refer to someone who is vile and horrible, evoking a troll in a bog) and “snozzcumber” (a “sickable”, “disgusterous” cucumber-like vegetable) are just a few examples of this in Dahl’s writing.This is why children understand the meanings, Rennie says. “That’s why they are so much fun: they are not complete nonsense. On the surface, he seems to be breaking the rules. But dig a little deeper and you realise he’s following standard patterns that people understand intuitively.”Rennie notes that, just as Dahl learned to make sense of some of the nonsensical words and phrases spoken by his wife, Patricia Neal, after she had a stroke, Sophie in The BFG is quickly able to translate for the BFG.As a bilingual Norwegian and English speaker, Dahl would have been able to look at the construction of English more objectively than monolingual writers, says Michael Rosen, children’s writer and author of The Fantastic Mr Dahl. “If you are bilingual, it gives you two heads. You have a head you can use to look at the other head. It enables you to see that you’ve got completely different ways of talking about something similar, and that one language might be able to do stuff or describe stuff the other language can’t.”He also credits Dahl’s education at a public school, Repton, for enabling Dahl to realise he could invent his own subversive vernacular: “Children in boarding schools often set up little coteries, partly to defend themselves against the authoritarianism of those schools with their own private language. Often, it’s elitist, but with Dahl the nice thing is that he wanted to share his language with children.”Frequently, Dahl invents insults and expletives to give power to the powerless characters in his stories, he says. “When you write stuff, and a teacher corrects it and hands it back to you, you don’t necessarily know that language belongs to you, that you can own it. But if you play with words and language or you know that you are entitled to, that is one way to own literacy – and that’s what Dahl wanted. He was desperate for children to read and have fun when they were reading.”• This article was amended on 28 February 2019.

It has hired a new supply chain chief and has made plans to fly in components or bring them in through naval ports.Andy Palmer, the chief executive, said a delay to Brexit would be a “further annoyance”. MPs could potentially vote on whether to delay Brexit on 14 March, a fortnight before the scheduled departure date of 29 March. Palmer added: “You’re holding that contingency stock for longer, which means that your working capital is tied up for longer. More importantly, what you’re doing is you’re creating continued uncertainty.”“Brexit also casts a shadow, as it does for the rest of the UK car industry, and that may present some big roadbumps in the immediate future if some sort of deal isn’t reached between the UK and the EU.”The carmaker produced five new models last year: the new Vantage and DBS Superleggera, along with special editions of the sports cars Vanquish Zagato Shooting Brake and Vanquish Zagato Speedster and a remake of the DB4 GT Continuation, which won on its race debut at Silverstone in 1959 when driven by Stirling Moss. The average selling price per vehicle was £141,000, excluding specials, and £157,000, including specials.Aston Martin will start the first production trial of the crossover model DBX, its first sports utility vehicle, at its new St Athan factory in south Wales between April and June, with full production starting early next year.The site will also be the centre for battery electric vehicle production and the home of Lagonda and the Rapide E – Aston Martin’s first all-electric production car – which is on track to start production this year.Catering for a wealthy clientele, Aston Martin is largely immune from some of the pressures the mass-market carmakers are under, such as sluggish consumer demand and the need to invest in electric vehicles.Palmer said: “As the UK’s only listed luxury automotive group, we have demonstrated our legitimacy in the global luxury market. Our well-defined expansion plans that combine outstanding high-performance cars with iconic brand status are on track as we manage through the uncertainties and disruption impacting the wider auto industry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e13308225e15e037c3a8e2920f60f57c94684e9/0_114_3333_2000/master/3333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4ab83a4b21df24a5a5fa30da85110e2","title":"the grey wall of china inside the worlds concrete superpower","story":"Beijing’s new airport is just the latest megaproject that has seen China pour more concrete every two years than the US did in the entire 20th century In the suburbs south of Beijing, what could one day be the world’s busiest airport is rapidly taking shape. Nicknamed “the starfish” due to the striking design by Zaha Hadid Architects, the Beijing Daxing international airport is set to open in October, and could eventually handle more than 100 million passengers a year.While the 52,000-tonne steel exoskeleton covering the airport’s six concourses immediately catches the eye, what lies beneath is familiar to many Chinese mega-projects: concrete – 1.6m cubic metres of it.Construction of the new airport hub started in 2014, and is one of the largest infrastructure projects initiated by the country’s president, Xi Jinping, in an effort to jumpstart China’s slowing economy and place Beijing firmly on the international stage.This week  Cities investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the planet, to learn what we can do to bring about a less grey world.Our species is addicted to concrete. We use more of it than anything else except water. Like that other manmade wonder material, plastic, concrete transformed construction and advanced human health. But, as with plastic, we are only now waking up to its dangers.Can we kick our addiction, when it\u0027s so hard to imagine modern life without it? In this series of articles, Concrete Week will explore the impact of the material on our environment and us, and look at alternative options for the future.Located 67km south of the capital, the airport sprawls across 780,000 sq metres – about a third of the size of Edinburgh. It aims to process 72 million passengers a year, and will have four runways by 2025, but there is a longer-term vision for additional runways and talk of 200 million passengers. Beijing’s existing international airport in the north-east, which will stay open, already handles around 96 million passengers a year.One group who won’t benefit from the cutting-edge contemporary design are the 20,000 people evicted from Daxing’s villages to make way for construction. Another 20 villages are slated for relocation after the airport opens due to concerns over noise pollution.The new airport is just the latest chapter in the story of how China became the concrete superpower of the 21st century. Since 2003, China has poured more cement every two years than the US managed in the entire 20th century. Even after a dip in recent years, China uses almost half the world’s concrete. The construction sector – roads, bridges, railways, urban development and other concrete-and-steel projects – accounted for one-third of the expansion of the Chinese economy in 2017.Like all of China’s concrete achievements, the Three Gorges Dam has been mired in controversy. Around 1.4 million people were displaced by the project, and there were complaints that the rehousing settlements were inadequate or that compensation money disappeared into local government coffers. More than 100 workers died in the construction process, and archaeological and cultural sites were flooded. None of this prevented Li Yongan, general manager of the Three Gorges Corporation, from declaring in 2006 that the dam was “the grandest project the Chinese people have undertaken in thousands of years”.Such ambitious infrastructure projects require a ready and vast supply of concrete. It is a demand that has been easily met by the country’s cement supply: in 2017, China produced 2.4bn tonnes of the stuff, more than the rest of the world combined. But China’s total capacity for cement, the main ingredient in concrete, is closer to 4bn tonnes. This discrepancy is accounted for by thousands of unused or underused cement factories that litter China’s industrial heartlands, a relic of years of rampant supply-side investment, supported by cheap loans to state-owned companies that disregarded profits in favour of growth, employment and kickbacks.China’s overcapacity problem, particularly in heavy industry, is well-documented. In February last year, the country’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced that capacity-expansion in the cement industry would be strictly off-limits for the rest of the year, with the aim of reducing capacity by a 10th by 2020.Such curbs on production don’t yet seem to be putting a halt on China’s concrete love story, though. In October 2018, the world’s longest sea bridge, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, was officially opened by Xi. At 55km, it is also the longest fixed link in the world – 20 times the length of San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge. It took 1.08m cubic metres of concrete, nine years and $18.3bn (£14bn) to build the snaking structure, which consists of bridges, artificial islands and tunnels.But the crisis of trust was not just about safety standards. The million cubic metres of concrete also represent mainland China’s growing reach into the supposedly autonomous regions of Macau and Hong Kong. Eddie Chu, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said last year that the bridge was a “politically driven mega-project without urgent need”, given the existing transport links between Hong Kong and the mainland. Others have called it a “white elephant” and an unfair burden on Hong Kong taxpayers.China’s concrete mania shows little sign of abating. High-rise apartments are constantly being added to the cities’ edges to accommodate the never-ending flow of migrants from the countryside, and headline projects such as the new Beijing airport or the Hong Kong bridge are considered prestigious achievements.On a more humble scale, the world’s longest 3D-printed concrete bridge was unveiled in Shanghai earlier this year. It is a feat of engineering, constructed from 176 inidual 3D printed concrete units.As Xu Weiguo, the architect of the 3D bridge, says: “It’s very easy to get and widely used in construction projects.” After all, he adds, “concrete is the cheapest construction material in China”.

When Queer As Folk was first televised, 20 years ago, I was a closeted 14-year-old who was, frankly, desperate not to be gay. Life is hassle enough, I thought. Any thoughts of same-sex attraction were met with an oh-God-please-not-this panic. A vision of a supposedly normal future life – wife, kids – was being snatched away, with no clear desirable alternative. Being gay seemed to me to be a mishmash of the threat of Aids, not being “a man”, dying alone, and a lifetime of misery and rejection.I grew up in the centre of Stockport, and Queer As Folk was set just seven miles away, on Canal Street (“Anal Street”, my peers would snigger), the heart of Manchester’s LGBT community. It may as well have been a different universe: I lived in a suffocatingly laddish, heterosexual world (the Facebook wall of one of my then best friends is today rife with Tommy Robinson videos) full of jibes about being gay – taunts I would indulge, in order to fit in. It wasn’t for another six years, after a silent unrequited love for an evangelical Christian and several relationships with girls, that I came out.It’s difficult to overstate how courageous or revolutionary Queer As Folk was. This was only just over a decade after the introduction of section 28 – the first new homophobic legislation since the 19th century – that meant LGBT issues were not discussed by a single teacher at my school, save for one occasion, when my class was told that anal sex was bad for you. Several anti-gay laws were in place: a different age of consent the right to discriminate in goods and services the banning of same-sex adoption. There were no civil partnerships, let alone same-sex marriages. In the 1980s the chief constable of Greater Manchester police had declared that HIV victims were “swirling around in a human cesspool of their own making”.It remained an era of unapologetic media gay bashing: in the year Queer As Folk graced Britain’s scenes, one front-page Sun splash asked: “Are we being run by a gay mafia?” Less than a year earlier, the first openly gay footballer, Justin Fashanu, hanged himself in Shoreditch.Watching Queer As Folk, then, was an all too brief refuge from a repressively homophobic world: a TV series that revolved entirely around a group of gay friends living their lives. This was the first time many gay teenagers saw same-sex affection, let alone gay sex. I had to sneakily watch it on an old 1970s TV set in my brother’s bedroom, perched right next to it so I could flick over the channel if anyone walked down the corridor.It’s difficult to see Queer As Folk as anything other than an unapologetic fuck-you to a hostile world. When gay people had previously appeared on TV screens, they were either sexless caricatures to be laughed at in a “the gays are hilarious but I wouldn’t let my kids near them” kind of way, or the subject of tragic storylines. There was a notable exception – the drama This Life aired two years earlier featured gay and bisexual characters, and included what were, back then, shockingly explicit sex scenes – but that’s all it was.So the defiance of Queer As Folk was liberating. At the end of the first episode, the two main protagonists – Stuart and Vince, both in their late 20s – drive the closeted teenager Nathan to school in defiance of his playground abusers in a car spray-painted by homophobic thugs with “Queers”, the scene played out to the tune of Suede’s Beautiful Ones. For gay men, of all ages, who had been brought up in a society that made them feel like deviants and objects of pity, this was a TV show that unapologetically showed love and sex.Predictably, the media still treated LGBT rights as something contested and up for debate. “Gay TV drama gets mixed reception,” declared the BBC, adding that while “some welcomed” the show “as a sign that the UK is becoming a more tolerant society”, others “condemned it as further evidence that the country is sliding down a slippery slope towards permissive immorality”. On BBC Breakfast News, the journalist Peter Hitchens denounced the show as propaganda aimed at persuading the public “that homosexuality is normal behaviour”. Twenty years on, all the anti-gay laws are gone, and – thanks to the struggle and sacrifice of LGBT activists – attitudes have undoubtedly been transformed. If only I could have told my 14-year-old self that being gay was not incompatible with a happy existence. Far from it. But this remains a profoundly homophobic society, one that inflicts terrible damage on LGBT people from the earliest age, which they internalise with lifelong consequences. Trans people today are suffering the same “moral panic” and vicious media campaign long endured by gay and bisexual people. And that’s why, with exceptions – such as the 2015 drama Cucumber, also from Russell T Davis, the creator of Queer As Folk – there is a depressing lack of similarly bold LGBT dramas. Two decades later, LGBT liberation remains unattained, and our lived experiences do not have the media representation they deserve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1e13b3676db617f95c446defd33e9ab86d1aeb2/0_0_941_339/master/941.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dd80d1438132dac84b8ef6be1e04cf8 465w","title":"womad uk festival artists performers brexit visas","story":"World music festival director says acts worry they will face visa problems this summerThe organiser of Womad has said the world music festival is struggling to book artists because many fear they might have difficulties entering the country due to Brexit.Chris Smith, the festival’s director, said it was getting harder each year to get people to perform.“Lots of artists are finding they can get to Europe but fear taking the next step to the UK, particularly if there is there is no passport union. It will become more complicated. When we are out of the EU the passport arrangements will change, so artists coming from wherever will get into Europe but worry they then won’t be able to cross the Channel.”While he noted their concerns may be unfounded because it was too early for artists to make official visa applications, he said there was a feeling this year of people asking: “Can we be bothered? Is this a process we want to put ourselves through?”Smith, speaking as the festival launched a 2019 programme including Ziggy Marley and Orbital, said that audiences had also expressed their concerns about the issue and had asked how performers could be made to feel more welcome. Smith described the fear that artists would overstay their visas as “arrogance”, because they were successful artists. “Why would they want to stay?”Womad (World of Music, Arts and Dance) was founded by the musician Peter Gabriel in 1982. This year’s UK festival will take place from 25–28 July at Charlton Park in Malmesbury, Wiltshire.Last year Gabriel expressed his “alarm” at UK foreign policy after a number of international artists were unable to perform at Womad due to visa issues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cb12310e55350b31e48ec8f1c0679dd98cf0940/0_236_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6012e39c6b8a866826779559ff4f0713","title":"school stockport close early fridays lack funding","story":"Teaching unions warn schools are at ‘absolute breaking point’ following budget cutsA state school in Greater Manchester is to close early on Fridays from September and charge parents who cannot pick their children up at lunchtime, in what teaching unions said was a sign that schools are “at absolute breaking point”.Vale View primary in Reddish, Stockport, is believed to be one of at least 25 schools in England to take the drastic measure of shortening the school week in order to cut costs.The chair of governors raised hackles among parents by trying to sell the half-day as a boon for families. “With such busy lives, we are sure many families will want to take advantage of their children finishing earlier one day a week a great opportunity to catch up, tackle homework or just have some quality family time,” wrote Dr Ricky van Deursen in a letter to parents earlier this month.The headteacher, Helen Hannah, said the remark was “well intentioned” but understood why it angered parents who worked or had children at different schools. Yet she insisted there was no alternative.Statutory pay rises had led to a £100,000 budgetary black hole and she was already making “double-figure” redundancies out of a staff of 90, Hannah said. Reneging on the early Friday closure would lead to more layoffs and bigger class sizes of up to 40 children, she warned.From September, classes will finish at 12.45pm each Friday. Parents who will not be able to pick up their children early will have to pay £3.50 per child to cover the costs of an after-school club.Governors said they had already cut almost £400,000 from the school’s budget since January 2017. Art therapy is due to stop in July, saving £9,500, and support for speech and language therapy has already been reduced by £16,000.The school has saved a further £50,000 by cutting subsidies for school trips, £40,000 on support for pupils sitting their year 6 Sats exams, £100,000 on resources and £136,000 by not replacing teaching assistants when they left or retired.One parent said he was troubled by the move: “Not just because of the impact on the children, but on all the staff as well. This is a school that tries very hard for all of the children, so I believe them when they say that this is the least worst option.” The father criticised the chair of governors, who “could have demonstrated better understanding of parents’ situations by not suggesting that they enjoy more leisure time with their children … Many families around here are scraping by and making do as it is, and this change absolutely will not help them or be welcomed.”Schools in Stockport, one of Greater Manchester’s wealthier boroughs, got a raw deal, said Hannah, the headteacher since 2017. Reddish is one of the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods, but pupils there receive £650 less than their counterparts a few streets away in Manchester, she said.“Running a school in Stockport costs exactly the same in terms of teachers’ salaries and the cost of providing a good curriculum, and yet a comparable Manchester school half a mile away would receive £350,000 more per year in basic funding,” Hannah added.The school insisted children’s learning would not be jeopardised and timetabled teaching time would be reduced by just 20 minutes each week because the school day would be slightly extended from Monday to Thursday.Hannah said she had received 21 emails from parents of the 550 pupils about the change. “Half were supportive and half were against. The emails against focus on the inconvenience of the closure on Fridays and the cost of childcare: even though it is reasonably priced, it’s a cost that parents have got to find,” she said.She insisted the change was definitely happening “unless there was a significant change in funding”.Andrew Gwynne, the local Labour MP, urged the government to increase school funding: “My message to ministers is clear: don’t hide behind false statistics suggesting you are protecting school budgets. This is a direct consequence of cutting the per-pupil funding in deprived communities like Reddish and the children in Reddish deserve a proper, decent, full-time education.”Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said shortening the school week should be ringing alarm bells for the government.“School budgets are at absolute breaking point. School leaders have made all the obvious savings – now they are faced with having to make major changes to the way they provide education,” he said.Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the trend of early closures in England was connected to the funding cuts many schools were facing.“Headteachers are having to make decisions that no one working in schools and colleges ever thought they would have to make,” he said.The government said it did not know how many schools had introduced half-days because they are not required to notify the council, Ofsted or the Department for Education. But Hannah said she had liaised with headteachers in Calderdale, Bradford, Manchester, Birmingham and London who “have all done similar or are doing so”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3abecd8debf3b17b8c945b404dee5c66172ef04/0_282_8272_4965/master/8272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=416d2925cca52da4637105a476d479ef","title":"pests homes spider man bug biolgist 5000 species","story":"Biologist Rob Dunn is the David Attenborough of the domestic sphere, uncovering everything from microbes in the shower to spiders in the basement. He goes on safari in the satisfyingly dusty corners of one Copenhagen homeThe good news is that I will never be home alone again. The bad news – well, it’s not in fact bad news, but it is slightly unsettling – is that I share my home with at least 5,000 other species: wasps, flies, spiders, silverfish and an exotic bunch of wild bacteria.All that information is apparently contained in a patch of grey dust I have just swabbed with my right index finger from a door frame in my living room. It’s like a DNA test of my house, says Rob Dunn, a 43-year-old American biologist who has come to my house in Copenhagen to hunt microbial life. He carries no lab gear and his blue crewneck jumper and striped Oxford shirt are hardly the combat suit of an exterminator. But with every discovery we make, with every spider we find lurking in the corner or each swab of dust, he displays an almost childlike sense of excitement. He swears and smiles, even whoops with delight: “This dust sample contains bacteria, your body microbes, your wife’s body microbes, your child’s body microbes. If you smoke weed we would find marijuana DNA in there. Everything is visible, but it’s also present in every breath. Every time you inhale, you inhale that story of your home.”Dunn is to house insects and indoor bacteria what Marie Kondo is to neatly folded shirts. He wants us to study the wildlife in our homes and realise that what we discover should spark much more joy than fear. When he began working as a biologist he went to the jungle to study wild beasts, but now his research is dedicated to species much closer to home: to the flies, spiders and bacteria hidden in every nook and cranny of our kitchens, bathrooms and basements. To the “jungle of everyday life”, as he describes it in his new book.Dunn is in Copenhagen for work and has agreed to come to my home to go through dusty corners and spider webs to point out where I might find some of the 5,000 species I bunk with. I suspect our 110-year-old house, shared with another family, is a fertile hunting ground, and Dunn seems optimistic. Using a screwdriver and tweezers, he pokes at light fittings and sifts through the basement, which can be a mould-friendly hangout during sticky, wet summers. While I’m making coffee, Dunn lets out a yelp: “Oh yes, this is good!” He has spotted a globe-shaped lamp hanging in the basement hallway, and in the bottom of the hazy glass cover is a Pollockesque pattern of dead wildlife. He tips the contents of the lamp on to a fold-out table and uses the tweezers to organise the harvest: two types of fly, a wasp, a meal moth, some aphids and various planthoppers. He takes a closer look at two of the dead flies: “I can tell they are likely to be the same species, but I don’t know for sure until I look at their genitals.”He turns to the silver-shiny meal moth. “Isn’t it just beautiful? It moved in with humans in ancient Egypt and has moved with humans again and again.”But how would it have ended up in our home?“This meal moth could have come in with grains.”Like from a box of cereal?Dunn wants us to see our homes the way we see our gardens. There are pests and pathogens we need to control – those that make us sick – but we also want to preserve ersity. He says fewer than 100 species of bacteria, protists and viruses cause nearly all infectious diseases today. We try to keep these in check with vaccinations and antibiotics, and by washing our hands. But that leaves us with a jungle of tens of thousands of other species, many of which we know little about, but which Dunn’s work suggests can often be more beneficial than harmful. For example, studies have shown that a higher ersity of bacteria on people’s skin – bacteria linked to soil and plants – can reduce the risk of allergies. He also mentions the discovery of a bug that could be a new source of useful enzymes: by testing the microbes in the gut of the camel cricket, found in many American homes, Dunn’s research team discovered bacteria that were able to break down industrial waste and turn it into energy. Making “cool discoveries” like this and enlisting the public to sieve through their homes for wildlife has spurred interest in a field he says has been neglected for too long.“The first drawings of microscopic life are all of household species,” says Dunn, “but once we figured out the germ theory of disease it shifted, and both scientists and the public started to think that what was indoors belonged to pest control. Ecologists went to the Galapagos, we went to the rainforest, but it pushed us away from the home and it left us with this huge blind spot.”I’m not sure I’m ready for an in-house pet spider, but while our natural inclination might be to shriek or stamp them out, Dunn wants us to protect them. “The natural enemies of the pests in our homes are very often, whether you like it or not, spiders,” he writes in Never Home Alone: “If you kill the spiders in your home (and this is precisely what we do with many kinds of pesticide applications), you do so at your own expense.”The curse of pesticides brings us to the bathroom and another key area of his research: shower heads. Dunn and his team asked people from across the US and Europe to send in swabs from their shower heads. And within the biofilm – “a fancy word for the gunk” that builds up inside them – they discovered a pathogen, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), that is linked to lung disease in people with weak immune systems. What they didn’t know was why this pathogen seemed more prevalent in some regions than others. “There was more of the NTM in the US and in particular in chlorinated water,” says Dunn. They came to the conclusion that “residual chlorine kills all the competing bacteria and just leaves the NTM, which are chlorine-intolerant.” And when the competition is eliminated, the pathogens thrive.He unscrews the shower head from the hose and runs his finger along the rubber fitting. There is very little biofilm-gunk, which he credits to the quality of the local water supply. “Most of Copenhagen still has untreated groundwater that relies on the wild bioersity of crustaceans and bacteria to clean it. But if you break that – like we do in the US – it’s super-expensive to fix it and it sucks. And it makes you sick.”Crustaceans? “Yes, in some cases you can encounter small crustaceans in the tap water here. Denmark tastes like bioersity.”We continue through the living room and kitchen. He pulls a book from the shelf to test for book lice, and picks up a log of firewood that has a spidery, grey pattern of reindeer lichen growing on the bark. In the kitchen he checks the dishwasher soaptray for a particular form of bacteria that is otherwise only found “in the faeces of tropical fruit bats”. Even our salt jar is apparently full of life: “Almost every crystal of salt has bacteria inside, and when you brine something in salt, those bacteria contribute to the flavours of the brine. The longer it sits in the brine, the more the microbes in the brine are going to contribute to it. Isn’t that cool?”Food is an area where Dunn has found the influence of microbes and bacteria to be more palatable to people he meets. Food is alive – whether it’s sourdough bread, kimchi or beer – and we are cool with that. Much more so than with the spider crawling across our windowsill. Dunn describes a study of how specific microbes found on bakers’ skin influence sourdough starters and the flavour of bread. His team gathered 15 bakers at a facility in Belgium and tasked each of them with making sourdough starters from identical ingredients. When they tested the bakers’ hands afterwards, it showed a close relationship between the microbial makeup of each starter and the bacteria found on the skin of the baker who made it. In his book Dunn describes how the bakers and biologists, drunk on spontaneously fermented Belgian beer, tucked into the breads and broke into an impromptu toast: “‘To bread, and to microbes!’ And to a house in which both are delicious. ‘To bread and to microbes!’ And houses in which we are all healthy. ‘To bread and to microbes!’ And to lives filled with wild species we have yet to study or understand, species that float like mysteries all around us and offer services we are only beginning to measure.” Our house tour and inspection has come to an end. I’m curious about the professor’s verdict. Is this a happy, fungi-rich, insect-thriving home? “You have a lot of species that I think of as being part of a healthy house,” Dunn says. “To me, your house is rich in bioersity and seems dominated by those things that you either shouldn’t worry about, or that are beneficial. Also, I don’t see antimicrobial products all over the place.”He points to the leftovers of a coffee kombucha-glazed Danish pastry we were eating earlier. “And then you have things that spark joy for you: fermented pastries, salt that’s alive and healthy water from Denmark that we know is alive.”As he says goodbye and walks down the garden path, I spot a tiny moth in our living room, flapping frantically in the corner. I don’t freak out or necessarily feel any great joy, but I leave the moth be. After all, there are 5,000 of us here, and you need to give your housemates some privacy.• Never Home Alone by Rob Dunn is published in the UK by Basic Books (£22.99) on 14 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6055e8c07b70956cfacda7a05195aa48880abab/0_0_4555_3017/master/4555.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7f8cec58a0d33b5f3fc3181f48bfdba6 2020w","title":"lanvins new designer reinvents houses original style bruno sialelli paris fashion week","story":"Bruno Sialelli ‘redefines wardrobe’ of maison with inspiration from archivesCan a 31-year-old cool kid bring France’s oldest couture house back to its former glory? That is the task the designer Bruno Sialelli is faced with at the French fashion house Lanvin and on Wednesday morning all eyes were on his debut.It’s not an easy task for a young designer who is used to being behind the scenes to take the spotlight, not least at a house which has been in turmoil since the acrimonious departure of its much-loved and revered creative director Alber Elbaz in 2015. Amid staff revolts and sporadic changes in strategy from the then owner, Shaw-Lan Wang, in the three-and-a-half years that have passed the house has seen two designers – Bouchra Jarrar and Olivier Lapidus – hurriedly appointed before being swiftly shown the door.As a result, the industry is pinning its hopes on Sialelli not only delivering a collection of hits but reigniting the reciprocal love affair they enjoyed. If he was nervous about his big moment he didn’t show it. While admitting it was an emotional moment, he said after the show that he was focused on “redefining the wardrobe” of the house and to do so he visited the personal archive of the house’s founder, Jeanne Lanvin.This was not, however, a trip down memory lane, but a fresh reinvention of the house’s history, which informed but did not dictate.Sialelli said he was instinctively drawn to the brand’s famous Lanvin blue, which he presented in modern knitwear that took the form of a cardigan-dress hybrid, pea coats with scalloped lapels and blue ribbed tabards.The latter was part of the overriding medieval theme of the show. Sialelli revealed Lanvin herself frequently worked with motifs from the era and he reintroduced it in scarf prints and – poignantly – an appliquéd motif of a knight in shining armour, a clever nod to Sialelli’s own crusade.He also worked Aztec and Fairisle patterned blankets into inserts on coats as wind-flaps and cuffs. Lanvin was a prolific traveller, he explained, “always bringing back the most beautiful fabrics” from her trips around the world.Refreshingly, Sialelli injected a sense of fun and mischief to the house that Elbaz delivered in bucketloads but which has been absent during his successors’ tenures. Illustrations from Jean de Brunhoff’s Babar the Elephant books appeared on silk shirts and bomber jackets, while a fox motif was 3D-appliquéd on lace slips, and hemlines came with click-clacky Perspex embellishment.Sialelli worked for four years under JW Anderson at Loewe – aka the poster brand for blending art, culture, and fashion – before his appointment at Lanvin, and it is clear he wants to bring that spirit with him.Before that he was in the design team at Balenciaga where he navigated the transition between the head designers Alexander Wang and Nicolas Ghesquière in 2015, suggesting that he has understanding of the upheaval the long-time atelier team at Lanvin have been through.In February 2018, the private Chinese conglomerate Fosun International, controlled by the billionaire businessman Guo Guangchang, fought off the competition to become majority shareholders in the business, leaving Wang with a minority stake. While details of the deal were undisclosed, the group is said to have injected a minimum of €100m (£85m) into the brand to help mop up inherited issues and kick-start the house into a new trajectory.On Wednesday, the show notes said Sialelli was “sublimating the illustrious heritage of the French maison in the midst of its own renaissance” and judging from this first collection, Lanvin looks like it’s finally found the man for the job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a455e8d4098b86097f94bf9996aadd745455b148/582_618_5333_3199/master/5333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc52a3a464c37429dcf5f48998574d65","title":"hannah review charlotte rampling andrea pallaoro","story":"In this often wordless drama, Charlotte Rampling brings an intelligent intensity to the role of a woman whose ageing husband has been jailedExperiencing the formal, compositional chill of this film is like opening the door of a freezer cabinet and putting your head inside. The Italian film-maker Andrea Pallaoro directs and co-writes, and the star is Charlotte Rampling, whose performance won her the Volpi cup for best actress at the Venice film festival two years ago. It is the portrait of a lonely, unhappy life and the action is almost wordless, in a series of scenes often recorded by fixed camera positions that (for a while) withhold from the audience the full truth of what is happening. It is perhaps inspired by Chantal Akerman’s 1975 film Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai Au Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles.Hannah (Rampling) is a woman living in a modest apartment on her own in Paris, her face an enigmatic mask. In fact, the film itself has what you could call Resting Charlotte Rampling Face: austerely intelligent, unsmilingly beautiful, intimidating, cold in a way that speaks of sadness protectively walled up in dignity and courtesy. It is an expression that could too easily be mistaken for simple contempt or self-disgust.She has a job working as a cleaner for a wealthy woman in an elegant, modernist house, and she has become reasonably friendly with the woman’s visually impaired young son whose blindness evidently facilitates the nearest thing Hannah now has to intimacy with anyone. It’s a Frankenstein’s-monster exile.Hannah appears a bit above this kind of work – though this may be an illusion created by the impression of martyred, fastidious hauteur. Maybe it is the only employment possible, because Hannah’s ageing husband (André Wilms) has been sent to prison, for a disgrace that we can just about imagine. Hannah gets silent phone calls and angry bangs on her door, an ordeal she accepts with calm.Perhaps Hannah has never been a very demonstrative person. Pallaoro shows how rare and subdued emotions are with her by having Hannah simply smile at her husband when she sees him at visiting hours and he asks: “Why are you laughing?” But Hannah is not incapable of expressing emotions. There is a wrenching scene in which she sobs with despair – in private.Hannah has accepted her husband’s word that he is innocent and she is just about keeping things together. What is helping is her membership of an amateur theatrical group that is rehearsing Ibsen’s A Doll’s House. The scenes of her participation in their various vocal and physical exercises, and the juxtaposition of these scenes with her day-to-day life as Hannah imperceptibly deteriorates, give the movie its flavour and its mystery.She has poured her denied emotions into this drama group. The sound of the voice warm-ups, with their stylised toneless singing, sound like Hannah’s own ventriloquised wails of anguish. She can act a role she can put on a show she can impersonate someone else – someone trapped. However, the nature of the play is probably not as important as the improv-type games being played. It is the nearest thing to a 12-step group for Hannah. But any therapy it provides is illusory.Hannah has no friends in the group. There is no question of going for a cheerful coffee and chat with some of them after the session. She seems to prize her solitude here as much as anywhere.Elsewhere we see Hannah going about her business, chugging stoically around on the Métro, and in one crucial scene doing so carrying a cake in a large and precarious cardboard box. We also see her in the swimming pool at the sports club and in the changing room where her nakedness is revealed without prurience: another aspect of Hannah’s affectless candour, which the film itself intuits. The pool, the Métro, the streets: these are public spaces in which she is utterly alone, at once crushed and hollowed out.My only reservation with the movie is that I found myself wondering if the drama-group scenes themselves could be extended and developed more than they are, even to the extent of Hannah taking part in actual production, in front of an audience, and we could savour the eerily refined spectacle of her denial and alienation. Yet perhaps that isn’t the point and would overbalance the form of the picture and compromise the essence of Hannah’s own barricaded privacy. It is a haunting portrait of emotional undeadness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud. I worked on this film to tell my story and hoped that it would resonate with people. To be nominated for this award is the highest recognition.”The film was produced by Simon Chinn and Jonathan Chinn of Lightbox (collaborator on the Whitney Houston documentary Whitney).

Enjoy might not be the first thing that springs to mind, but it might be time to get onboard as, over the past year or so, adding a handful of mushrooms to your hot drink, chocolate or energy bar has become an increasingly normal thing for people to do.Reishi, boletus, cordyceps and lion’s mane sound less like mushrooms and more like things you reluctantly take as a last ditch attempt to clear up a patch of eczema – and, indeed, high claims have been made for their supposed health benefits. Most sellers talk up their products’ antibacterial, antiviral and immune-enhancing properties, but don’t go so big on the fact that, say, cordyceps are parasitic fungi that grow on insects (mmmm, is that my stomach rumbling?).So, does parasitic fungi grown on insects taste nice when dropped into an espresso? Fans online have described mushroom coffee as tasting somewhere between tea and coffee (which sounds like the kind of thing you get from the ’s office drinks machine no matter what you order), so I headed to Planet Organic in north London for one of its Superfood coffees, a combo of reishi, maca, espresso and hazelnut mylk. The barista describes them as a popular choice: “Not world famous, but they have a … cult following.” As if by magic, the person queuing behind me steps up to order a mushroom coffee. “And she’s not even being paid by the  to do it,” I think to myself.The drink tastes surprisingly non-weird: there is a slightly unusual bitter finish, but it doesn’t exactly scream: “Oi, you’ve got mushrooms in your drink, you weirdo.”This lack of mushroomness turns out to be a regular occurrence in the world of shroom food. For instance, you probably wouldn’t detect any mushroom in Pollen and Grace’s hazelnut, praline and reishi Super Square unless you had been forewarned – maybe not even then. The variety of mushroom chocolates I test also taste overwhelmingly funghi-free: Hifas da Terra’s agaricus blazei chocolate tastes like slightly dusty dark chocolate, whereas its chocolate, marron glace and boletus is nothing more alarming than “pleasantly nutty”. Only its chocolate blend of cordyceps sinensis and pollen feels suitably earthy – enjoyable for me as a lover of both mushrooms and weirdness, but arguably less so for my colleagues, whom I caught screwing their faces in disgust as they sampled it. After a week of mushroom eating, the only thing I can find that tastes definitively of mushrooms are Other Food’s slightly more traditional oyster and shiitake chips – whole mushrooms crisped up and marketed as a healthy alternative to crisps.None of these products come cheap, it should be noted. The chocolate bars could set you back £6 to £8 for a 100g bar, while even the bag of crisps pushes £3. Is it worth it? That really depends how much you believe the health-benefits spiel. To me, the shroom craze appears to be just the latest stage in the wellness era, where increasingly strange-sounding powders and potions are disguised in your drink in return for a hefty price tag. It might make sense to save your cash for making a fancy risotto instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1873d69fe86b072a6c046fcdee898e66790b6df5/0_125_3762_2257/master/3762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2946f57d6d8d6fb23ae415290f7f52d","title":"dropping arrizabalaga payback chelsea sarri","story":"• Willy Caballero chosen in goal for win over Spurs• Sarri: ‘Kepa made a big mistake and paid’Maurizio Sarri justified his decision to drop Kepa Arrizabalaga as payback for the goalkeeper’s petulance during the Carabao Cup final, with the world’s most expensive goalkeeper far from guaranteed a return for Sunday’s game at Fulham.Arrizabalaga, who had apologised and been fined a week’s wages, sat out Chelsea’s excellent victory over Tottenham after refusing to be substituted at Wembley. He remains Sarri’s first choice but, with Tottenham unable to muster a shot on target to unsettle his replacement, Willy Caballero, Arrizabalaga may have to wait for a return to the first team.The youngster had learned of Sarri’s decision in the pre-match tactical team meeting on the day of the game. “It was the right decision: Kepa made a big mistake and paid with the club, so then he had to pay with the team,” said Sarri, whose side play Dynamo Kyiv at Stamford Bridge in the Europa League next week. “But now I think we have to stop.“Kepa, from tomorrow, will be with us. I don’t know if he will be on the pitch in the next match or not, but in one of the next two, for sure. When you are young, you can make mistakes. The most important thing is that you need to understand very well, after every mistake. So now, for me, the issue is closed.” Asked whether the £71.6m signing from Athletic Bilbao remained his No 1, Sarri said: “Of course.”Chelsea’s victory maintained their pursuit of the top four, with Spurs’ advantage over fourth-placed Arsenal – whom they play on Saturday – trimmed to four points. More significantly for Sarri, this victory healed some of the wounds inflicted by poor results over recent weeks, and staved off what had been the very real possibility of the sack.“In this job, you are under pressure every week,” he said. “If you’re lucky, every six months. It’s normal if you lose two or three matches in a row that you’ll be under pressure, but that’s the same for every coach. We hope this is the turning point. It was really very important to win because we are fighting for the top four. Maybe, with this result, we can involve Tottenham in this battle. The gap is very large, seven points, but maybe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61d33bfa2ca9561f0caa5e71e5508290376b7903/0_72_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba63dc93b6b8fec01e18d0de0ece91f5","title":"romelu lukaku manchester united criticism premier league","story":"Romelu Lukaku’s two goals against Crystal Palace on Wednesday took him to 111 in the Premier League, level with Dion Dublin as the 20th most prolific scorer in the competition’s history. This was only the fourth time he has completed 90 minutes under Ole Gunnar Solskjær and they were his first goals in almost two months, and yet there is a sense that Lukaku as much as anybody is benefiting from the burst of Norwegian sunshine over Old Trafford.Perhaps it doesn’t seem like much for the 10th most expensive signing in history to pull level with the presenter of a daytime-TV property show. It should be acknowledged that there is some evidence that football was played before 1992 and that some forwards may have amassed many more goals before the Premier League existed. But still, Lukaku now stands only two goals behind Ian Wright (who admittedly was 28 at the start of the first Premier League season) and nine behind Steven Gerrard in the overall rankings. He is 25.There is something slightly unsettling about Lukaku. He is a player who seems to draw disproportionate criticism. There is something about him that feels unconvincing. His first touch occasionally seems heavy. His movement at times seems unimaginative. He is capable of missing fairly straightforward chances, as he did early on at Selhurst Park.But then he is also capable of executing finishes like the two that brought his goals. Receiving the ball from Luke Shaw for the first, he let the ball run outside his right foot, which took him away from Martin Kelly but not near enough to James McArthur for him to make a block, while also giving him enough space to shape the ball round James Tomkins and into the bottom corner past Vicente Guaita, who was probably unsighted by the defenders. It was somehow both clinical and graceful.The second demonstrated great awareness even before the skill of the finish. As Victor Lindelöf’s header dropped, it would have been easy for Lukaku to come to the ball, to challenge Jeffrey Schlupp. Instead, he read the trajectory and let the ball drop over his shoulder, using his body to hold off Schlupp, and then had the athleticism and technique to get over the ball at the top of its bounce and hook it past Guaita.So what then, is the problem? Lukaku scores goals consistently, getting into double figures in the league in each of the last seven seasons, something all the more remarkable given only two of them have been spent with a “big six” side. He has a remarkable range of attributes, technical and physical. The issue, perhaps, is that he is not quite what he appears to be. The most striking thing about Lukaku is his size. He has the physique of a classic target man, and that allows him to do things that are impossible for others. And yet he is not a target man.He can play with his back to goal, but it is not necessarily his preferred position. There were times under José Mourinho when he became isolated. Some players thrive on that. Salomón Rondón, for instance, the bulk of his international experience with Venezuela being not just as a lone forward but as a lonely forward, is adept at playing as far away from his teammates as possible, relishing the challenge of turning a loose ball into a free-kick or a throw-in.But that is not Lukaku. His best two performances in the past year have probably both come on the right wing, for Belgium against Brazil in the World Cup quarter-final and for United at Arsenal in the FA Cup. On neither occasion was he playing as an orthodox winger both times his job was essentially to stay high up the pitch behind an attacking left-back. On both occasions he was devastating on the counter. Lukaku may have a chest that seems to demand the ball be pinged into it, but he is probably better with the ball played in front of him.There are those moments of occasional clumsiness. Perhaps they’re the result of an occasional loss of concentration, but such aberrations do seem to be a feature of big players in general, as though it’s very difficult when bulk begins to go the wrong way to make the necessary adjustments.In target men, that might be forgiven, but there Lukaku falls victim of the underlying recognition that he is an all-round striker, simultaneously both target man and not target man so nobody knows quite what standards to apply. It’s worth remembering, though, amid all the doubts, that the only player younger than him who has scored more Premier League goals is Harry Kane, who was born 10 weeks after Lukaku.He scores goals, is tactically adaptable, capable of technical excellence and happens to be big and strong as well. Perhaps he isn’t such an obvious part of Solskjær’s vision as the more mobile trio of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard but as a back-up and a more physical option, Lukaku still has plenty to offer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66b56f0bd26edd73a95b0d1b2dee2c5aa5721d12/17_122_2574_1544/master/2574.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f44e3fa5380d27cc7e938cdf0580ecb5","title":"manchester city west ham necessity calls champagne football on ice","story":"The champions may need to grind out more results as they did against West Ham if they are to retain the titleManchester City may have to play more of the bump-and-grind football that got them over the line against West Ham on Wednesday if they are to defend their Premier League title successfully. They hogged the ball but lacked edge in front of goal until Sergio Agüero’s 59th-minute penalty secured all three points. At half-time West Ham were holding City 0-0 and the memory rewound to Pep Guardiola’s pre-game declaration. Before the 11-game title run-in the manager said he wanted no excuses from his players – no citing fatigue or adjustments to the XI – if desire to defend their crown fell low.Guardiola tested the second part of his stance by changing nearly half the side from Sunday’s Carabao Cup final, though with players such as Danilo, Riyad Mahrez, Leroy Sané, Vincent Kompany and Ilkay Gündogan drafted in he would have been confident of doing so with little or no dip in quality. The manager’s faith looked well-placed when Mahrez ghosted into the area early on, though his attempt lacked poise. He had said he would state afterwards whether City had met his demands and he described the performance as “very good”.After seven minutes West Ham might have been 4-0 down, David Silva going closest in hitting the post. Passes were being pinballed between Kevin De Bruyne, Kompany, Oleksandr Zinchenko, David Silva and Gündogan in a relentless rhythm that left West Ham chasing shadows. Though City had not scored, the sense was that, if one goalcame, several more could follow. Yet as the half-hour approached with the game still scoreless Guardiola showed the first signs of agitation. First he indicated to the bench that a ball should have gone long rather than short down the left. Then he was visibly disgruntled to see Mahrez caught offside. De Bruyne was next to leave the Catalan nonplussed when he hit a pass straight to Felipe Anderson, the visiting No 8. De Bruyne found his man – Mahrez – when next in possession and, although the shot was saved by Lukasz Fabianski, it did draw applause from the manager.Before the match Guardiola fielded a question about whether he believed Liverpool were stuttering after three draws in their last four league outings. By half-time Jürgen Klopp’s men were cruising at 2-0 up over Watford and City were level, with Guardiola the frustrated one of the two managers.It was his team who were slightly out of sync and appearing creaky. Sunday’s triumph took 120 minutes plus a shootout. Guardiola may not want to countenance tiredness but City also remain in contention for the Champions League and the FA Cup as they chase what De Bruyne terms the “impossible” dream of a quadruple, and that is bound to drain energy.The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.Moments before the interval West Ham put together a sequence of passes that moved them from defence to attack and did to City what they love doing: pulling teams all over the pitch. The travelling support serenaded their side and Guardiola looked bemused. The latter emotion was heightened when De Bruyne’s touch deserted him and what should have been a delicate ball to Mahrez was smashed straight out.Worse was to follow early in the second half as West Ham came close to taking the lead, Ederson’s acrobatics keeping out an Andy Carroll effort. Now, though, City’s depth of quality started to be felt.On came Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva in quick succession and suddenly the latter was the filling in a Ben Johnson-Anderson sandwich. The referee, Stuart Attwell, awarded the penalty and Agüero stroked it home.City deserved the advantage and in taking hold of the match Guardiola’s demand that he “smell” the will to get up for this last phase of the championship race was met. Their last 10 games are Bournemouth (away), Watford (home), Fulham (a), Cardiff City (h), Crystal Palace (a), Tottenham Hotspur (h), Manchester United, Burnley (both away), Leicester City (h) and Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion (a).Two fixtures stand out – the back-to-back meetings with Spurs and United – but City will be wary of every team. Guardiola believes there will be more twists and turns and that City and Liverpool will both drop points.Since losing 2-1 at Newcastle at the end of January the champions have won four league games on the bounce. They have done so with champagne football – 6-0 and 3-1 over Chelsea and Arsenal at home – alongside the more rudimentary performance that did for the returning Manuel Pellegrini’s team.City wound down the clock near a corner flag, a rare sight from a team whose head coach espouses positive, front-foot play. They may need more of the bump-and-grind stuff to eke out results like this before they end their campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7d72e243c6dad35bab63cf4c8c223a6c95280c8/0_0_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e42e92529ed5dbb813787e2ffdb3a20c","title":"like test driving a car how virtual investing prepares you for the real thing","story":"Virtual trading platforms are demystifying the world of trading, and opening up the potential rewards to the general publicInvesting is no longer the preserve of moneyed men of a certain age. It’s something anyone who cares about their financial future should consider.The old adage that investments can go down as well as up remains true, but investing makes sense for anyone keen to see a high rate of return over the long term. Yet a common misconception prevails that cash savings are safe, whereas investments are risky.That’s not true, according to Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at investment platform Willis Owen. He believes anyone looking to save money over a period of 10 years or more should seriously consider investments.“Cash savings aren’t what they once were, and don’t deliver over the long term because they offer interest rates below the rate of inflation. That means the spending power of your savings actually falls over time,” he says.“More than ever before, we need to invest for retirement.”Opening a cash Isa is one thing, but investing in stocks and shares can feel scary by comparison. Lowcock thinks we should see it as a natural progression, and says investing isn’t as risky as its reputation suggests.“If you’re investing for the long term, there are ways of building a portfolio that aren’t high-risk,” he says. “While there’ll be lots of volatility in the underlying investments over the long term, investments in stock markets generally go up over that time period.”With so many fund options out there, picking solutions for your own investment can be complex. Willis Owen has developed a virtual investment tool called Play, which enables users to become seasoned investors without parting with a penny. It replicates what happens on the stock market, so users can research funds and invest up to £10,000 of virtual money in a portfolio.“It’s like taking a car for a test drive before you buy” says Jason Chapman, managing director of Willis Owen. “With little or no investment experience, you can get to grips with everyday investment risks and opportunities, and experience everything from picking a sum and making an investment decision to handling the transaction and monitoring the portfolio.”A virtual investment tool helped Andrew Buchanan, 24, get to grips with investing in the US stock market. “I wanted to better understand what influenced the share price of the major blue-chip companies in the US, so my goal in using the tool was to test my theories on various pieces of financial news, without putting any capital at risk,” he says.“I’d read about various trading strategies, and the tool enabled me to put them to the test to see how they played out in practice. I also wanted to learn more about the metrics that were available, and I could see the sort of data people were using in the pits.”Virtual investment tools aren’t just for those who are new to investing, however. Seasoned investors can replicate their live portfolio and try out different investment strategies risk-free.Jacqueline Mitton has been investing in unit trusts for more than 30 years, managing her own portfolio for most of that time. Using Play allowed her to experiment with an investment strategy that she was too nervous to apply to her live portfolio.“In my live portfolio, my investment strategy has been rather cautious I’m not a risk taker by nature, and I didn’t imagine I’d invest in any of my Play funds in the real world,” she says. “But building on what I’ve learned, I’ve now decided to put aside a sum of money for investing more adventurously.”Owning your financial future can be a daunting prospect. But using investment products is as easy as any other money-related activity, be that transferring your balance to a new credit card or taking your lunch to work to save cash. A virtual investment tool can help users develop confidence – the lack of which holds many people back from investing.“There’s a conception that investing is complex, but the actual transaction can be done as easily as buying something from Amazon,” says Lowcock.Nonetheless, there’s a big difference between spending £5.99 on a book and putting £1,000 into an Isa. “Investing is a completely different feeling and experience it’s not a physical product and you don’t get next-day delivery on it. Play enables you to gain essential expertise and build confidence before taking that first step.”With a live investment portfolio, mistakes can be costly. With a virtual tool, you can apply valuable lessons learned to your live portfolio. “You will make mistakes as an investor, regardless of whether you’re new, very experienced or even a professional, but how you handle those mistakes is crucial to your success,” says Lowcock.“One of the biggest investing mistakes most people make is selling the moment their investments fall in value and the markets drop, but with a virtual portfolio you can afford to wait and watch it recover, because you’re not losing anything.”It’s no surprise that people put off decisions about investing, but Chapman recommends spending as much time planning for your retirement and financial future as you do planning your next holiday. You don’t need a meaningful sum of money to invest, either.“People worry that their investment could fall significantly in value, but that’s unlikely to happen if you’re well ersified, and you can start investing with as little as £25-£50 per month,” he says.“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket buy a range of funds to reduce the risk and ensure you’ve got exposure to other markets beyond the UK, where people are concerned about Brexit,” he advises.“If you’re not putting too much in up front then just enjoy the experience,” adds Lowcock. “And remember why you’re doing this – for your family’s future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ae8b3ef382a033076d2f10cb06dd04266f21d64/2017_190_4262_2557/master/4262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=123c62c6ca7012e11defe065f7411778","title":"my dad was proud of me for organising my pension how one freelancer shored up her future","story":"For the self-employed, a pension can seem impossible – but it doesn’t have to beFreelance writer Rachel Spencer was 34 when she made the leap and set up her first pension – caving in after her financially savvy father badgered her to do it. “My dad was really amazing with money and he explained to me that that a self-invested personal pension (Sipp) was a great way of generating a lot of money if you put in a decent amount every year. Back then it was the glory days of journalism, so I put in about £500 a month for two to three years.” A decade later, Spencer is happy to have been swayed by her father. “I’ve made a decent amount of money through it so far, with £18,000 saved from putting in £12,000,” she says.Spencer, who lives in Newcastle with her partner and also runs a PR consultancy called Publicity for Pet Businesses, was attracted to the flexibility offered by a Sipp. “I didn’t want the commitment of putting into a pension forever,” she says. “I was earning good money at the time and thought rather than wasting it I would start plotting ahead for when I’m older. In my early 30s I was single and I didn’t have other big commitments – and I knew, as a freelancer, income can be hit and miss and you don’t know what’s round the corner. My dad died a few years ago, but I know he was proud of me for organising my pension.”Sipps put the customer in the driving seat, rather than leaving the pension provider to allocate your money to different funds. You decide when, where and how you invest your money, whether that’s in inidual stocks and shares and government and corporate bonds, or exchange-traded funds and commercial property.“A Sipp allows you to be in charge of the investment decisions,” explains Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen. “Previously, people didn’t have control over their pensions. Now you can choose where to invest, or you can delegate it to another party. You can be risky or cautious, or somewhere in between. At Willis Owen, we research funds, provide starter portfolios and offer help to anyone investing. We also offer a one-stop shop fund solution, where the manager is making decisions on your behalf to suit your appetite for risk.”Lowcock says Sipps provide more transparency than your typical pension. “Even if you’ve delegated it to someone else, you can still log in and see your investments 24 hours a day,” he says. “You can also move your investments around quite easily.”Organising a Sipp is straightforward: just apply online at the provider you choose and invest a minimum of £25. The whole process takes about 10-15 minutes, although Lowcock warns that if finances are tight and you’re already worried about making your mortgage repayments, you should think carefully before choosing a Sipp investments can go up or down.You can also press pause on your Sipp if those contributions are needed elsewhere. Spencer, now 43, bought her first house in Warrington when she was just 25, and invested in a property in Lymm in Cheshire with the profits. She has since bought a second property, in Newcastle. “I like the fact I can stop paying into it when I need to focus on other things in my life, but I will restart it again soon,” she says.Looking ahead, Spencer is set to be financially comfortable in her retirement. “I know I’ll have property income and a safety net from my pension.” But there won’t be any sitting on her laurels, as the pet-lover plans to set up a dog-friendly holiday home business.“I spend as much time as possible travelling and seeing different places with my dog, Patch, so I would love to be able to create my own weekend retreats for dogs and their owners,” she says. “I’ve always been a grafter and I can’t imagine doing nothing in my retirement, so creating amazing experiences for other crazy dog people like me would be ideal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c304e6fa18274d2bc5fe3c7c3568cd692af8ebb/0_99_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fd907e73f186f5f81838579cdfdc6e4","title":"struggling to sleep share your experiences","story":"If you have problems sleeping at night we’d like to hear from you is planning a new video project about sleep.We’re hoping to understand more about how people are affected by sleep problems and would like readers to tell us how they navigate sleepless nights.We want to include first-person video testimony from our readers.

He left his job in corporate marketing to buy the pub in 2015 when it was due to be lost for good.He said he had been left “speechless” by the win. “All I wanted to do was to get the little Wonston Arms pub in the Good Beer Guide annually, getting in there was mission accomplished. I saw that as a huge step … but once I got in the guide, there aren’t any pubs left doing what we are doing,” Todd said.He added that the place was unique in that it was a “traditional English boozer”. He said it had grown in popularity due to word of mouth as opposed to extensive marketing.“People keep coming to see it and telling more friends, and we got into the last 16 last year, and this year, blimey, we are the best pub in country according to beer drinkers … I am flabbergasted and stunned – our little pub has beaten off the big boys,” Todd said.Last year, the Wonston Arms, near Sutton Scotney, picked up the award for best pub in the region.Todd explained that the community put in a bid to save the pub three years before he had enough money to buy it, but they came up £75,000 short. He said this attempt to take it over lengthened the pub’s “stay of execution” and allowed him to gather the money he needed to make the investment.“I was ready in April 2015 and bought the freehold myself, outright … but that connection with the community was never lost. I said if I do this guys, although you are not putting money in, work with me. The community came together to renovate the pub,” he added.Todd said making the leap from the corporate world to becoming a landlord was a big step. “It cost me hundreds of thousands to buy it – a genuinely massive purchase,” he said.The Wonston Arms is also the heart of fundraising for the local area. It has generated in excess of £25,000 from the pub community. Every month, it hosts a pop-up cafe, which has raised more than £7,000 for local charitable causes.The local MP, Steve Brine, said: “The pub trade is not easy these days, to put it mildly. In this context, it is even more impressive what Matt Todd and the team have achieved. The fact he’s done so while staying so true to the values of real ale, a decent local pint and community is just great.”Ben Wilkinson, the national pub of the year coordinator, said: “Matt and his team have created a fantastic rural village pub with a great atmosphere, by shaping it around the community and its needs. They have realised that it takes something special to create a sense of real belonging so that people want to come out of their homes and back in the pub.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c50da4dda228a52fbe95d62ef36c8552ad87ebe/0_127_2313_1388/master/2313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4fd3484715a2a723c182855f8261fc4","title":"contribute podcast clothing fashion sustainable","story":"We’d love to hear your thoughts about the environmental and ethical impact of ‘fast fashion’, and how we as iniduals and nations can rethink attitudes to shoppingIn the next episode of our We Need to Talk About podcast, we’ll be exploring how an inidual can rethink their relationship to clothes and make easy choices towards sustainable shopping.

We want to gather questions from readers and supporters who are experts in related fields, but also those who have personal experiences or reflections to share. In particular we’re looking for positive solutions-based ideas about how we can improve the situation.Lucy Siegle, MP Mary Creagh, and others will be discussing this issue in our next recording.

In the UK alone, it was worth £32 billion in 2017. According to consultants McKinsey, the global apparel, fashion and luxury industry outperformed all other market indexes in profitability between 2003 - 2013, “outstripping even high-growth sectors like technology and telecommunications”. It is believed one in six people on the planet work in the fashion supply chain, yet it remains one of the most polluting industries on the planet. In our next podcast, we want to ask: How can the fashion industry as a whole be held accountable, and what role can the government, and we as iniduals, play in improving this growing issue?The UN says that given the growth in global population, by 2050 the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles. Huge numbers of brands still depend on vastly underpaid workers to make clothing meet consumer demand. In 2013’s Rana Plaza tragedy, a Bangladesh textile factory collapsed, killing 1,134 people, despite warnings over the safety of the structure. It transpired that the building housed five garment factories supplying global fashion brands.In addition to concerns over worker safety, the fashion industry has come under scrutiny for its impact on the environment. During just one washing cycle, a washing machine can leach up to 1000,000 microfibres into our waterways, rivers and oceans, and be consumed by fish, other marine life, and in turn, humans. And clothing is often not recycled – it is believed that Americans dispose of about 12.8m tons of textiles annually. In the UK every year, £140 million worth of used but still wearable clothing (350,000 tonnes) goes to landfill. From an environmental perspective, fast fashion is disastrous.The Green Carpet Challenge (GCC) is one example of how celebrities are using their influence to affect change. This pioneering organisation was founded by Livia Firth and Lucy Siegle in 2010, when Siegle challenged Firth to attend all her red carpet commitments in sustainable clothing. At first she wore ‘ethical’ designers, to the ceremonies, including Orsola de Castro, who designed a dress made out of textile waste for the 2010 Oscars. Now, the business has expanded and the pair work with some of the world’s most famous design houses to help them implement more environmentally responsible business practices.Other prototype solutions that are being trialled include: solar textiles, garments made using biological catalysts which are capable of ‘eating’ plastic, 3D printing for clothes, compostable clothes made from materials such as orange fibre and apple leather, and lab-grown leather. But can any of these offer the practical and long-term solution we need? Is it a case of changing our shopping habits, and buying more second-hand clothes? Or should we be aiming for shifts on a bigger scale? How can we put pressure on fashion houses to implement change? And which is the most promising of the scientific innovations in this area?We look forward to hearing from you!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73e4346a540e85d5e653f3f70a3e118d0ddf29ca/0_250_5035_3021/master/5035.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a08d5e9d7d85e0a3c344f40cdac37d2c","title":"thank you for soundtracking my life readers tributes to mark hollis","story":"You have been reacting to the news Mark Hollis, lead singer of Talk Talk, has died at the age of 64Spirit of Eden is simply brilliant and one of the top ten albums of all time for me. I worked at both EMI and PolyGram (where they later signed to Polydor) and remember being staggered at the ambition, scope and sound of the albums he delivered. In my opinion, way beyond anything anyone else was doing at the time. Today, on my way to do the shopping I will listen once again to the music of a man who I genuinely think was a genius.Anybody who has never experienced the album, please do yourself a favour and sit down and listen to it. It is not instant and needs working at to appreciate it. But what that is brilliant comes to you without hard work? It needs time and works in its entirety as it does not have a “hit” anywhere near it. It is not designed for, nor does it work in today’s Spotify or iTunes single track format, nor did it for radio andor MTV at the time. The compression that the internet gives does no justice to the atmosphere achieved on the original vinyl either. But I will guarantee that once it has got into you, it will be with you forever, like all good things will satisfy your soul. A genuine masterpiece. Leon DepopeIt’s funny how things affect you. It makes no difference functionally, since Mark Hollis disappeared from public life in 1998, and I certainly never met him, but I’m heartbroken.He said (and I’m very much paraphrasing here) that he’d done everything he set out to do with those later albums, Laughing Stock especially, and that’s why he slowed down and eventually stopped. I suppose because he was able to express himself so perfectly, to listen to those records is to know him intimately. I always loved who I heard in them. A sweet soul, and an awkward bastard. I still cry every time I listen to Laughing Stock after more than a decade of listening to it on average every few days.Even if I imagined the person I heard, It makes me so sad to know that he’s not around any more. So effortly blessed. Andrew SamoyedIf there’s such a thing as a vibration of the human spirit, Mark Hollis knew how to make music to match its timbre.What an amazing, profound, integrity filled man he was. With some musicians you always look at their careers and think what might have been. Well, there’s no such regrets here.Farewell Mark, you’ve given me more inspiration then any artist on this planet. jesusjuice89We’ve lost a great, singular talent. Together with his bandmates in Talk Talk he produced some of the most incredible music to have ever emerged from the UK. Talk Talk’s progression over five records is utterly ridiculous. Genius.Living in the Netherlands, Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock will forever bind me to the idea of English pastoral melancholy, the essence of my Englishness. AnhagaTo this day I still listen in awe at what manifests forth and out of Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock especially in the darkest hours of time and of the soul. I cannot put my finger on it but as I get immersed in all the storm, swirl and silence of the music all I ever experience is light and rapture. To me they are the most disquieting yet magnificently uplifting records I have ever listened to, and yet I can only listen to them alone, the experience is too personal and intense to share. They are the most spiritual musical experience I have ever had and I cannot begin to document how much of an impact they have had on me and my life. Thank you, Mark Hollis. thegreatdarginiI’m struggling on this one so unexpected. I always had this feeling he’d just emerge again one day, drop an album – no fuss, no build-up … and, of course, it would be perfect. Just like Laughing Stock, just like the solo album and, of course, just like Spirit of Eden. When most of the music from the end of the 20th century is long forgotten those albums will still be played, admired and loved.Thanks (along with Paul and Lee) for helping to soundtrack my life, Mark. Love to your friends and family. As the trees come into leaf over the next few weeks I’ll do what I always do at this time of year - play The Colour of Spring over and over again. Mitch44I first heard Spirit of Eden when I was a sixth-form student almost 30 years ago. I’d heard nothing like it in my life. I knew of the early New Romantic Talk Talk, and some pretty catchy songs, but this? It was just from a different world ... I must have listened to that album thousands of times since and it still gives me goosebumps. There is simply nothing much to compare it with – perhaps only Laughing Stock and Hollis’s wonderful solo album.Some say that Bark Psychosis are their nearest comparison. They’re good, but they’re not Talk Talk. And Hex is great, but it’s not Spirit of Eden. Nothing can top that ... I always held out a faint hope he’d break cover and give us something new to wonder over. Sadly, what was always likely is now certain. Now is the time to turn the lights off, put the headphones on, and put the album on one more time. There will be goosebumps, all over again ... thanks Mark, you were a genius.

MPs would be able to amend votes on future EU workers’ rights legislation, meaning they can potentially force the government to accept new rules.Unions, including Unite, were expected to be consulted in the final stages of preparing the statement, though the TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady, has been publicly sceptical about the guarantees.It is unclear whether the final package of measures will be offered as a separate bill, which some Labour MPs have demanded, or as part of the EU withdrawal bill, which other Labour MPs prefer because they believe it would be harder to unpick.Labour MPs who support the new measures are unsure how many more colleagues will be won over by them. “I don’t know how many more people’s minds this is going to shift,” one said.A Downing Street source said the timing of the announcement had not been finalised, though it would be before the meaningful vote. The prime minister may hold the vote next week, before the 12 March deadline, depending on when the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, is able to reach an agreement with Brussels.In her statement to the Commons on Tuesday, May promised to give parliament a vote on whether it wished to follow EU standards in areas such as workers’ rights and health and safety. She also pledged that the government would consult with businesses and trade unions when it looked at new EU legislation.The prime minister promised to give the commitments force in UK law, without specifying the form this would take.May has been talking to a small group of Labour MPs who have been pushing for the guarantees, including the former minister Caroline Flint and the backbenchers John Mann and Gareth Snell.Snell robustly defended the group’s actions in an exchange during the Brexit debate, saying: “I have spoken to the prime minister about workers’ rights, funding for our towns post-Brexit, and what we need to do to find a way through this. Some of my colleagues have labelled those things as bribes, but they are wrong what we are trying to do is find a constructive way forward.”James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, is expected to announced a £1.6bn Brexit fund, spread over seven years, for towns and coastal communities. Government sources said they hoped it would be announced before the next meaningful vote.The fund was intended for 26 of the 38 “local enterprise partnerships” and none of it would go to London. Regions such as the Black Country, Greater Manchester and other Midlands regions, for example, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, were likely to get the most significant funding, according to the Sun.May confirmed at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday that there would be a fund to “ensure our towns can grow and prosper”, but declined to give further details."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1abe8277125ed70af0f7bb726502f81bd0b8234e/0_57_4168_2501/master/4168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32d00b1480f728496a082a93cb76189c","title":"brexit latest news developments mcdonnell says theres chance labour could win vote for second referendum politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenChris Williamson, who has been suspended from Labour for saying the party was “too apologetic” in response to complaints about antisemitism, has posted a message on Twitter thanking those Labour members who have supported him.Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, has told BBC’s Radio 5 Live that the party’s inquiry into Chris Williamson should take “weeks, not months”. In an interview with Emma Barnett, asked how long the investigation should take, he replied:It has to be very quick …I’m not going to set a date but I do know our general secretary is under a lot of pressure on this ... I would imagine, in order to gather evidence and for him to have his case heard, it’s probably a matter of weeks ... But it’s definitely weeks not months, in my view.Curiously, Watson also insisted that he was not technically Corbyn’s deputy. This may come as a surprise to anyone familiar with his job title but, in response to a question as to whether he was speaking out as Corbyn’s deputy or in his own right (Barnett wanted to know why Corbyn was not giving interviews on Williamson), Watson explained:I’m not actually Jeremy’s deputy. I was elected by 200,000 Labour party members. I have my own mandate and I have a responsibility in light of that, which is why I am speaking out now.The Greek foreign ministry has uploaded a Brexit FAQs website for UK nationals living in the country. The “Greece gets prepared for Brexit” site comes a week after Athens’ leftist government announced that the rights of all UK nationals resident in Greece - estimated at 45,000 - will be fully protected in the event of London crashing out of the EU without a deal. The site lists various FAQs under a picture of the Parthenon and, given the uncertainty, ends with “more questions ands answers to follow soon!” Net migration from outside the EU has hit the highest level in nearly 15 years, as a post-Brexit plunge in arrivals from the bloc continued, new figures reveal. As the Press Association reports, overall, the balance between the numbers arriving in and leaving the UK remained above 250,000 - nearly three times the government’s target level of below 100,000. Office for National Statistics data showed that 261,000 more non-EU citizens came to the country than left in the year ending September 2018. This was the highest estimate since 2004. EU net migration continued to add to the UK’s population, but it almost halved year-on-year to 57,000 - a level last seen in 2009, the Press Association reports. Overall, around 283,000 more people moved to the UK with an intention to stay 12 months or more than left.At the public administration committee Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has just told MPs that there will be an announcement about “new towns” next week. He was responding to a question from Labour’s Rupa Huq about reports that the government will increase investment in leave-voting Labour areas, in what is being seen by some as a move to encourage Labour MPs to vote for the government’s Brexit deal.Alberto Costa, the Tory MP forced to resign as a parliamentary aide by Theresa May, has obliquely criticised the government’s sluggish decision to back his EU migrants amendment as “better late than never”.Costa, a Scot who served as private parliamentary secretary to Scottish secretary David Mundell before effectively sacked for putting down the unauthorised amendment, robustly defended his actions in an interview with BBC Radio Scotland.He said his amendment, which instructs May to seek European Union guarantees on residency rights for EU migrants living in the UK after Brexit, and vice versa, had unified Westminster’s parties for the first time since the Brexit vote in June 2016. He told Good Morning Scotland:I brought together all wings of my party, the Labour leader and his party, the SNP leader and his party, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, and his party, the Green party, the Welsh nationalists, Lady Herman, the DUP it’s the first time we’ve ever seen the House of Commons putting their name down to an amendment with full government backing, on a wholly uncontroversial issue. This morning, I’m really pleased.Costa, the MP for South Leicestershire, and a lawyer, refused to discuss the nature of his dismissal, but said he and May had “a full and frank discussion” about his measure after prime minister’s questions. There was significant levels of confusion at Westminster over whether May would endorse his proposal she eventually did.I made it very clear to her that the whole house was brought together by my amendment she confirmed she would give full government support, and you know what, all I care about are the rights of five million people.Asked whether he felt he had been a casualty of Brexit chaos, he said: “Well there’s an old idiom of better late than never.”Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. The Tory Brexiter David Jones has just asked him if there is any precedent for cabinet ministers openly arguing against government policy, as is happening now. He was referring to the way three pro-Europeans published a Daily Mail article on Saturday saying the government should rule out a no-deal Brexit. Sedwill appeared to concede that this was unprecedented, saying “I don’t think there’s an exact parallel”, although he subsequently said similar issues arose at the time of the Iraq war.He also admitted that there was too much leaking from cabinet. There has been a “breakdown” in confidentiality, he said.Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader and shadow culture secretary, was on the Today programme this morning ahead of a speech he will give later on online gambling. My colleague Rob Davies has previewed the speech here.But Watson was also asked about wider Labour issues, particularly antisemitism. Here are the main points he made.I’ve asked to see Jeremy on Monday next week to talk about how we can further improve our measures to deal with antisemitism. When Luciana Berger left the Labour party, I thought it was the worst day of shame in the Labour party’s 120-year history. A pregnant young MP bullied out of her own party by racist thugs. The one thing I say to my colleagues and half a million Labour party members is that I am not going to allow them to be tainted by racism, so I am going to speak out on antisemitism for as long as it takes to root it out and deal with it. There’s inidual responsibility here but there’s also collective responsibility on the shadow cabinet and national executive committee to speak out and deal with it.Having monitored some of the things he’s said in the last week, our general secretary decided that the pattern of behaviour over recent months was potentially bringing our party into disrepute, and so has suspended him from the party and there’ll be an inquiry. He’s entitled to a fair hearing but I’ve been very, very concerned that his comments have almost been deliberately inflammatory and causing offence to not just parliamentary colleagues but people in the Jewish community who understandably have a real concern about antisemitism in the Labour party.He could easily be prime minister. But, of course, we could do without the antisemitism because it allows you to ask me that question on the Today programme. We need to close these issues down and we do it by being absolutely vigilant in the way we deal with racism in our own ranks. That’s on all of us.For very understandable reasons in the party - to do with the challenge to Jeremy a couple of years ago and some MPs not wanting to serve - we’ve not got a balance of traditions on our front bench. We can handle that, but it does mean there needs to be a different way of making sure that those traditions’ voices are expressed in a different way on policy-making. There’s no big issue about this but I do want the democratic socialist and the Christian socialist and the social democratic traditions to be heard in the parliamentary Labour party - if not on the front bench, to be heard by the front bench.In the Commons Nick Brown, the Labour chief whip, has just moved the writ for the Newport West byelection, caused by the death of Paul Flynn. It is due to take place on Thursday 4 April.After its Brexit amendment was defeated in the Commons last night, Labour is now officially committed to backing a second referendum. That does not mean that Jeremy Corbyn has become a passionate enthusiast for the idea, there are still many in the party who suspect that his office will manoeuvre to sabotage any such people’s vote if it becomes a probability (not least because it would be hugely isive), and there is no evidence that, even with Labour whipping its MPs, there is a majority for referendum legislation in the Commons.Still, David Cameron (if we believe Donald Tusk) and Nick Clegg (see here) are both available to give Corbyn some advice on what can happen when you back a referendum expecting it to never happen.And last night John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said there was a chance Labour could win a vote on a second referendum soon. In recent weeks McDonnell has become much more positive about the case for a second referendum than Corbyn and this is what he told ITV’s Peston programme.Things are shifting. There is a chance we could win it, and I’ll tell you why. It’s because people are worried about their constituencies, they’re worried about jobs, they’re worried about the economy. And I think the more we focus on that, the more there’s a chance that either a deal will go through that will protect jobs and the economy, or to get some deal through it will be conditional on going back to the people.McDonnell also said that, even though his Hayes and Harlington constituency voted leave, he would vote remain in a second referendum, he would campaign for remain if there were a referendum. He explained: After the vote last night Jeremy Corbyn himself also released a statement saying that the party would now “back a public vote in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit or a disastrous no deal outcome”. But he included a caveat, adding:We will also continue to push for the other available options to prevent those outcomes, including a close economic relationship based on our credible alternative plan or a general election.Here is the agenda for the day.9.30am: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, takes questions in the Commons.10am: Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, gives evidence to the Commons public administration committee.10.40am: Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader and shadow culture secretary, gives a speech on online gambling.4.30pm: Theresa May speaks at the end of the Jordan: Growth and Opportunity Conference, following talks with Jordan’s King Abdullah in Downing Street earlier.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit.

An ultrasound of the 28-year old mother at six weeks suggested the twins were identical – with signs including a shared placenta. But it soon became clear all was not as it seemed.Twins are normally either identical or fraternal. In the case of identical, one egg is fertilised by one sperm, but the resulting ball of cells splits in two, giving rise to two offspring with identical genetic material. In the case of fraternal, or non-identical, twins, two eggs are fertilised, each by a different sperm. The resulting siblings arise from the same pregnancy, but are no more genetically similar than siblings from the same parents born at a different time.Faced with a puzzling scenario, Gabbett and colleagues report in the New England Journal of Medicine that they took samples from the two amniotic sacs, allowing them to investigate the genomes of the twins during the pregnancy.The results, they say, reveal a very unusual situation: the twins are semi-identical or “sesquizygotic”. “What we have got is a sequence of unusual events,” said Gabbett.The situation is believed to arise when two sperm cells fertilise a single egg. In the latest case, one sperm carried an X chromosome among its genetic material, and the other carried a Y chromosome.After fertilisation the chromosomes from the two sperm cells and the single egg got bundled into three “genetic packages”: one contained chromosomes from both sperm – meaning it contained two sets of genetic material from the father, but none from the mother. The other two packages each contained the same set of chromosomes from the mother, as well as genetic material from one of the two sperm, giving rise to either XX (female) or XY (male) cells.As the fertilised egg ided and the ball of cells grew, those containing only chromosomes from the two sperm died. However, those containing chromosomes from both the egg and a sperm cell continued to ide.“Then what happens is that little ball of cells splits into two, and that is why you have twins,” said Gabbett, adding that these offspring have a greater genetic similarity than fraternal twins, but are not identical.But the situation is not that straightforward: some of both embryos’ cells contained two X chromosomes, while other cells contained an X and a Y chromosome.Gabbett added since one twin was a boy and the other a girl, the ratio of each of these types of cell differed: one embryo contained a greater number of XY cells, so developed male, while the other had a high proportion of XX cells and developed female.The only previously reported case of sesquizygotic twins came from the US in 2007, discovered after one of the children was born with ambiguous genitalia. The team say the children in the latest report had no such ambiguities.However, the case was not without complications. While the children were delivered by caesarean section and appeared healthy, it was found the baby girl had developed a blood clot shortly before birth. Her arm was amputated when she was four weeks old.Then at the age of three, the girl had her ovaries removed as it was found they had not fully formed, which can increase the risk of a certain type of cancer – a situation that was down to her genetic makeup.Gabbett said that while there might be other, unreported, cases of sesquizygotic twins, it remains a very unusual phenomenon. Among their investigations, the team looked back at genetic data for nearly 1,000 pairs of what were thought to be fraternal twins, but found no other cases.“It is incredibly rare so we don’t think it is something people should be routinely tested for or worried about,” said Gabbett. But, he added, it challenges conventional thinking. “We traditionally categorise twins as either identical or non-identical, and this is a third type of twinning characterisation,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53cfb68828dbfddd66d8be86c41a57e365611a13/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7310ed3a962ace7d8bea32bd180631ae","title":"diabetics eating disorder diabulimia","story":"Diabulimia, which can be fatal, occurs if type 1 diabetics stop taking insulin to lose weightDiabetics who also have a rare and potentially fatal eating disorder are to start receiving specialist NHS help to reduce their risk of suffering its “devastating” consequences.About 55,000 people in England with type 1 diabetes also have diabulimia, which occurs when a person with the condition stops taking insulin regularly because they want to lose weight.Support from nurses and counsellors for people with diabulimia will include advice on how to prevent harmful social media postings from affecting their behaviour.Leading doctors and health charities said the little-known condition can lead to a stroke, kidney failure, an amputation, blindness or even death.NHS England is bringing specialists in diabetes and eating disorder care, who usually work separately, into new combined teams that will help patients in London and on the south coast.Hundreds of people will be treated by teams centred on King’s College hospital in the capital and Royal Bournemouth hospital in Dorset. NHS England hopes the pilots will show health professionals the best way to treat those with diabulimia.An estimated 42,000 women and 13,000 men in England who have type 1 diabetes – the autoimmune version of the disease, which is not linked to lifestyle – also have diabulimia. People with type 2 diabetes cannot get it.Prof Jonathan Valabhji, NHS England’s national clinical director for diabetes and obesity, said: “As a diabetes clinician I’ve seen first-hand the devastating impact that this condition can have on people and their families, and so these services are an important step forward in the recognition of diabulimia.”Many people with diabulimia do not tell friends and family they are not taking regular doses of insulin, which adds to the difficulties NHS staff face in spotting those who have it.Most type 1 diabetics who skip doses of insulin do so to reduce the weight gain that taking it can involve.Diabetes UK said: “Diabulimia is serious, but it’s not a recognised mental health condition in its own right. And because it isn’t widely understood, some healthcare professionals may not spot the signs or know how to support someone with it.”The Labour MP George Howarth has been campaigning to raise awareness of diabulimia since his daughter Sian died from it aged 24 in 2011.Dr Dasha Nicholls, the chairwoman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ eating disorders faculty, said: “Because diabetes forces you to focus on what you eat, it is not unusual for that to get tangled up with feelings about food, weight and body image.“But in the case of diabetes that can become dangerous very quickly, because of the impact on blood sugar levels.”Welcoming the announcement, Tom Quinn, the director of external affairs at the eating disorders charity Beat, said: “Standard treatments for people with eating disorders often don’t provide the right support for people who also have diabetes, who may experience additional issues including the misuse of insulin and its extremely serious consequences.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d387badd9cf6cb237b1e836eb222ad8dee792dc/0_111_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6718bf45537d0b08a46604066bfbc48a","title":"labour to push for stricter online gambling regulations","story":"Deputy leader Tom Watson to call for major overhaul of law to stop ‘gross excesses’Labour is to propose an overhaul of online gambling law, including new restrictions on how much customers can bet and a system of checks to stop people placing wagers they cannot afford.The deputy leader, Tom Watson, will say on Thursday that a series of high-profile scandals have proved that regulations governing online casinos and bookmakers are inadequate, leading to “gross excesses, abuse and vulnerable problem-gamblers being let down”.Watson, who has already proposed a series of measures cracking down on the wider gambling industry, will describe the Gambling Act 2005, passed under Tony Blair’s government, as “unfit for the digital age”.“Whereas gambling in the offline world is highly regulated, the lack of controls on online gambling is leading to vulnerable consumers suffering huge losses,” he will say.“Online gambling companies have a responsibility to protect their customers from placing bets that they cannot afford.”The most eye-catching proposal would involve capping the amount that people can bet online and the speed at which they can do so.Watson, who is the shadow secretary for digital, culture, media and sport, will highlight the government’s recent move to slash the maximum allowable stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from £100 to £2.He will question why such strict limits are not in place for stakes placed online, despite recent research claiming that smartphone gambling apps are more dangerous than FOBTs.Watson will also call for online casinos to perform affordability checks, analysing whether customers have enough money to make high-stakes wagers.The Remote Gambling Association, which represents online gambling firms, said it supported “moves towards affordability and targeted intervention”. However, it warned against “arbitrary limits that risk driving customers to the unregulated and illegal gambling market”.Watson has already had some success with policies announced last year following a party review that called for a “whistle-to-whistle” ban on gambling ads during live sports broadcasts, and an end to the use of credit cards to place bets.The industry has since volunteered to stop advertising during sport, while the government has asked the industry regulator to review whether gambling on credit should be banned.Calls for a radical rethink of gambling laws follow a series of cases that fuelled concern about the behaviour of online casinos and bookmakers.They include Ladbrokes agreeing to pay £1m to the victims of a problem gambler who had stolen money to bet, on condition that they did not tell the Gambling Commission, the industry regulator.The commission said: “The online gambling sector is tightly regulated and we continue to review and develop our regulations with new technology and innovation in mind.“This is a stringent regime which has allowed us to take action against operators who don’t offer the best possible safety and protection for consumers. One example is our ongoing robust regulatory action against the online casino sector which has so far resulted in £14m in penalties.”The level of financial penalties issued by the commission, including those relating to offline bets, has risen steadily from £5.2m in 2016 to £10.8m the following year and £28m in 2018.Labour said it would launch a consultation about the relationship between video games and gambling, particularly betting-style features such as “skins” and “loot boxes”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24efaab4df27768785f061dced7bae37c4c90ce6/0_168_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0098d7e623f19820d53b0378fa6fa88f","title":"public sector workers living wage in work poverty report","story":"Care workers and cleaners among those trapped in in-work poverty, say campaignersMore than 1 million public sector workers in Britain are paid less than the amount required to make ends meet, trapping them in in-work poverty, according to a report.The Living Wage Foundation said as many as 1.2 million people working for the NHS, councils and other public sector employers receive unsustainably low wages of less than £9 an hour, or £10.55 in London.The real living wage is higher than the government’s legally enforceable “national living wage” of £7.83 an hour across the country, which is to rise to £8.21 from April.Using data compiled by the Smith Institute, the report revealed the vast majority of public sector workers earning below the real living wage are in local authority jobs, including teaching assistants, cleaners, care workers and catering staff. Almost half a million are on outsourced contracts, while 725,000 work directly for a public sector body.The analysis comes after years of public sector pay freezes imposed by the Conservatives. Although Theresa May has since scrapped the policy, the prime minister is still under pressure to show austerity is at an end after nearly a decade of cuts.Christina McAnea, the assistant general secretary of Unison, said: “Hundreds of thousands of workers delivering essential public services are on poverty pay. Many have second and even third jobs just to keep the wolf from the door.”A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “Every employee deserves a fair and competitive wage that recognises their hard work and contribution to our economy.“The government has demonstrated its commitment to workers’ rights through the biggest package of workplace reforms for over 20 years, and has helped to deliver the fastest wage growth in 20 years for the lowest-paid workers through the national living wage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6f75dcc6f361ecc3f62f5fe76ddc9f3731dbaf5/39_182_1977_1186/master/1977.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a342adb14b5334db56b18379a634558","title":"james degale retires boxing 10 years","story":"James DeGale has announced his retirement following his unanimous points defeat by Chris Eubank Jr.The 33-year-old, a two-time world super-middleweight champion and the 2008 Olympic middleweight champion, was the first British boxer to win both an Olympic gold medal and a professional world title.DeGale said in a statement: “Today marks 10 years since my professional debut fight on February 28, 2009, and today is the day I am announcing my retirement from boxing.

It marked the highest number of black American golfers to play in a PGA tour event but it was still far from representative of the demographics of the United States. As Black History Month ends, the  spoke with three black golfers to discuss the progress the sport has made and, more importantly, what it needs to do to continue growing the participation and inclusion of African Americans.Cheyenne Woods, LPGA Tour player: Every weekend I would be in front of the TV watching Tiger Woods with my golf club in hand. I distinctly remember going to a junior event thinking I had a great idea of wearing black and red, only to find out every other junior golfer thought the same. Tiger was “cool”, and he made golf “cool” to go out and play.Harold Varner III, PGA Tour player: I loved that you could do it by yourself. It’s not like other sports where you need someone else to be there to compete against, or you need someone throwing the ball to you. With golf, it’s just you and the course.Mackenzie Mack, professional golfer and LPGA certified instructor: I don’t run very fast and don’t jump very high so golf was a game that I could play and be successful. And golf was a game we played as a family. So trying to beat my sister, Sydnee, who was also a Division 1 scholarship golfer was always fun.CW: No. Growing up, I loved the fact I was usually the only girl in school or only black person at tournaments. I enjoyed the feeling of being different. I have had so many instances over the years of proudly telling people I play golf. I can’t count the amount of times I am then replied to with: “Wow, you don’t look like a golfer”. I’ve continued to grow my love of breaking the mold of what a “golfer” has been.HV: No, none whatsoever. I didn’t really think about it until I got on the PGA Tour when I was asked about it, and people made me aware of it. But my parents were really supportive, and tried to give me all the opportunity possible to play. I did play in some Bill Dickey tournaments when I was younger, and that was an eye-opener because it was the first time I played with another black kid in a tournament. I remember thinking, “Oh, I’m not the only one.” But we also had Tiger Woods, who was dominating at the time, and not only did people of color look up to him, so did white golfers.MM: I grew up in an urban junior golf program called Valley View Golf in Las Vegas whose goal was to get minorities involved in the game golf. So, I grew up with other minority golfers at my local facility but when I traveled outside of my local facility, my sister and I were often the only minorities we saw. The lack of ersity never discouraged me from playing the game though because I loved it so much.HV: It’s ridiculous how expensive golf is and it’s hurting the game. I just don’t see a lot of mini golf courses where they have the same kind of programs that I had when I was growing up, and I think in order for golf to reach more people, we need more programs like that.MM: I am a testament to how the game has slowly evolved over time. It is an honor to be the fourth African American woman to hold dual membership in the PGA and LPGA. I hope to inspire the next generation to play the game as the ladies before me, did for me.CW: The only challenge I’ve found in the lack of ersity in golf, is the weight and responsibility to be one of few representatives of African Americans in golf. Diversity has been an ongoing topic in the sport, however there is still so much room to grow and improve. I hope to continue encouraging the message that golf is not defined by the stereotype it has historically gained.HV: I’ve never had trouble playing, or had issues playing on a course, or anything like that. I’ve certainly heard stories of older golfers who were denied access, or never got the opportunity to play, but I never had to deal with any type of discrimination on the course.CW: One program in particular that played a huge part in my junior golf career was the Desert Mashies, founded by Bill Dickey in Phoenix. It is connected with the Bill Dickey Scholarship Association and Bill Dickey Invitation which almost every single black golfer currently on tour has been a part of. It is a unique environment of bringing together the best minority golfers in the country and allowing them to connect and compete. It also creates college scholarship opportunities to those wanting to play at the next level.HV: I started a foundation called HV3, and we’ll be hosting our first tournament on 23 March. It’s to help kids get exposure and access to golf, because not many kids can go to a golf course and just play golf, and we want to change that.MM: I have seen golf move in the right direction over the years with initiatives and efforts from The First Tee, PGA, LPGA, We Are Golf, Bill Dickey, Women in Golf Foundation, Fore Life and many many more. But there is still a long way to go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/953c83eb7796ce41f698bbdae441de9e59a7afa4/5_200_3666_2199/master/3666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3888e4ce0064e01a93d5641d78985618","title":"north london derby routs the virtuosity of sir viv and f1 memories classic youtube","story":"This week’s roundup also includes indoor athletics chaos, Leeds v West Brom infamy and Manasa Mataele brilliance1) Tottenham v Arsenal approaches, so here’s a ransack of the archives for some of the choicest moments of pridehumiliation. One of Arsenal’s finest moments at White Hart Lane came at Christmas 40 years ago, with this seasonal shellacking and a Liam Brady masterclass: “Look at that, oh look at that!” Winning the title is a distant dream for Arsenal at the moment, but they’ve famously clinched it on their rivals’ patch twice – in the Double-winning year of 1971, and the “Invincibles” season of 2003-04. Of course, Spurs’ current “patch” remains Wembley, while their new stadium is unfinished, which of course was the venue for the sweetest of derby triumphs, the Paul Gascoigne-inspired FA Cup semi-final win in 1991. They enjoyed this cup drubbing 10 years ago, too.2) Lots of people are good at rugby. Manasa Mataele is good at rugby backwards, and while falling over.3) There’s plenty to look forward to at the European Indoor Championships this weekend, but sometimes indoor athletics goes wrong, as it did here in 2000 – six started, only three finished in the 400m semi-final. Britain’s best gold medal hope this weekend is probably Laura Muir, who won the 1500m and 800m two years ago.4) There’s no way we can let a West Indies v England one-day series pass without a look back at this, Viv Richards smacking 189 not out at Old Trafford in 1984, in the days when people just didn’t smack 189 not out in ODIs. West Indies also have fond memories of beating England in the final of other international knockout competitions, the World Cup in 1979, the Champions Trophy in 2004 and when Carlos Brathwaite battered Ben Stokes at the World T20 three years ago.5) It’s Leeds v West Brom on Friday night: a big one in the Championship, so let’s go back to 1971 to join Barry Davies and a Leeds team going mad because they had every right. Sticking with the this weekend1971 thing, it’s El Clásico on Saturday so here’s the corresponding fixture from 48 years ago: only a 1-0 win, but the Spanish version of Pathé news is still enjoyable. And another from this riff that we can’t really remember why we started but we’re too deep to stop now: it’s Bayern v Borussia Mönchengladbach, who just happened to be the Bundesliga top two in 1971. Here’s the latter beating the former in a crucial game on their way to winning the title.6) The Formula One season is almost upon us, with all the cars unveiled and tested. Give them a quick once-over here, and compare them with the finest machines of 50 years ago here, and here’s some footage of that year’s German grand prix, which was won by Jacky Ickx, with Jackie Stewart in second.1) From the early days of on-board F1 footage, here’s some of Hans Heyer gunning it around Hockenheim in 1977.2) A gloriously pointless little graphic that shows the progression of the world table tennis top 10 rankings, set to some Les Rhythmes Digitales-esque funk.3) Steph Curry takes the p in the NBA All-Star game with an absurd bounced assist.4) This does come around every few months, but the December 2006 goal of the month competition is always worth a watch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/716c3a6c78b435d213cc65f413275c259a0905d9/0_246_7301_4382/master/7301.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b00bc26267b3b157b8cbab85cf801a6","title":"tip a great beach cafe or bar in europe for a chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Good food and drink can set a beach venue apart from the rest, especially if there’s a cool view.

Moments earlier, a rock the size of my head had come crashing down. Myself and my fellow climbers shouted at the top of our voices and watched with relief as it came thudding to a halt a couple of hundred metres beneath us. No one was hurt.And, truth be told, it was all my fault. I have only been climbing for little more than a year, and I’d been abseiling down an adjacent face in Rockaway Gully, Tasmania, when I dislodged the rock with my foot. I’d been hoping to get a better shot of my guide John Fischer, who was about to give our climbing trip another dramatic twist. But we’ll get to that later.I’d come to Hobart principally for the Australian Wooden Boat Festival, an event held every two years to celebrate all types of sailing vessels, from tall ships and dinghies to canoes and kayaks. The docks of the old whaling port were awash with masts and sails, and sunburnt sailors littered the harbour.I’d rowed into town with a crew of Scots and Tasmanians aboard a traditional five-oared St Ayles skiff. We’d been part of a 10-day small sailing and rowing boat expedition from Recherche Bay in far south Tasmania to the boat festival, a distance of 100 nautical miles. By the time we arrived, we all poured into the historic Hope and Anchor Tavern on Macquarie Street to down a few well-earned ales amid the cutlasses, hagbuts and harpoons that decorate the walls, and lead the raucous mob in rowdy sea shanties.From there, we dragged ourselves down Liverpool Street to crash at the comfortably crummy Pickled Frog Backpackers hostel, which boasts that, over the years, it’s “hosted sailors, whalers, smugglers, gold-diggers, daredevils and wanderers” (12-bed dorms from Aus$26£14 a night). The following morning, I surveyed the litter of casualties curled up on the worn sofas of the lounge, and began to think about my other purpose in visiting Hobart: climbing.Mount Wellington is 20 minutes from Hobart, and has 400 climbing routes tucked in the rock formations beneath its summit. One of them is a circuit called the Organ Pipes, where the dolerite rock is similar to basalt: columnar with “splitter cracks” and as grippy as rough sandpaper.My guide was tousle-haired John Fischer, aka Crazy John, an American immigrant to Tasmania, who in 2015 made Isle of Rock, the first film about rock climbing on the island. We were going to climb Fiddlesticks on Flange Buttress, a medium grade 60m gem of a climb, executed in two pitches. I gracefully declined John’s offer to lead and instead followed his fluid and skilful upward motion, playing out rope. John also offers non-climbers an abseiling-only option opening up the roped experience to all, regardless of ability.By the time we were halfway up, the clouds were parting, the sun was flashing a smile and the views down the Derwent and across to Bruny Island were stunning. “It is one of the better routes of its grade in the whole country,” John said. The hard bits are not too hard, the rock is extremely grippy and all I had to do was trust in the rubber of my climbing shoes. After a celebratory chat at the top, we abseiled back down to our packs.John has a touch of the “dirtbag” about him. And that is not at all pejorative. American climber Fred “Dirtbag” Beckey (14 January 1923 – 30 October 2017) slept in cars, ate junk food, eschewed patronage and just lived to climb, claiming hundreds of first ascents. “Will belay for food” read his cardboard hitchhiking sign. John had not brought any lunch and had asked fellow climber David Tan to meet him at the summit with a cheeseburger from the urban valley below. It was eagerly anticipated, yet when David arrived he had brought no such luxuries. Instead, he rummaged around in his van like an ibis, a bird unaffectionately nicknamed the “bin-chicken”, to find a curried veggie pie – only a bit past its “sell by date” – and proffered it as an apology.By the afternoon, John and David were scaling Albert’s Tomb, a 10-metre needle of rock which is extremely difficult to climb.They were vying with some real life bin-chickens for a perch atop the narrow column. But John’s aim was more ambitious: to jump to the adjacent cliff-face and back, a feat he had performed years earlier. I was watching from on a nearby face, peering anxiously through my camera. David was egging him on from below.Suddenly, John sprang forward and, somehow, his palms stuck to the coarse cliff opposite.He climbed a little higher and then dropped like a hawk back on to the table top of the plinth. I exhaled and took my finger off the shutter button."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18b5e88e5f41032c717da99a294fbbd57febbac4/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7476a3a7dc021b4888d3abe7cc9729ea","title":"better things gets better pamela adlon triumphs without louis ck","story":"In its third season, the smart, un-flashy series about a single mother juggling her life as an actor with her role at home, feels fresher and more daring than everSince it first began in 2016, Better Things has been slowly becoming one of the finest comedies on television, but it has always been resolutely un-flashy in its brilliance. Partly that’s because its subject matter is contained and domestic, and because, in a typical episode, not very much appears to happen at all. Pamela Adlon, who writes, directs and stars, has fashioned a gorgeous and loosely autobiographical story about a raspy-voiced single mother, Sam, who is a jobbing actor, and her three daughters, living in Los Angeles. It touches on elements that are at once familiar - ageing, mortality, how women and men relate to one another - and gives them all new powers.The show was created by Adlon and her one-time close friend and collaborator, Louis CK, with whom she shared writing duties. But, as the second season ended, and allegations about CK’s behaviour began to surface, it seemed for a moment as if Better Things could become collateral damage, caught up in the fallout of its association with him. In the aftermath, Adlon severed ties with CK and with the manager they shared, Dave Becky. In an interview with the New Yorker, Adlon said she didn’t know if she could continue with the show, whether her heart was still in it or not. Happily for fans of this beautiful, affecting series, she took some time to work it out, hired new co-writers, and got on with the job.It feels apt, given that the show is so often about Sam having to do just that, whether that is work, or raising her daughters, or looking after her increasingly forgetful mother. She may find any given situation tough, but there is rarely an option of simply giving up. “There is a mountain of mom shit I have to do every day,” she tells her doctor, when he tries to espouse a “let it go” approach to life’s stresses. For her, letting it go is just not possible, but she finds a remarkable amount of warmth in getting by.The third season of Better Things finds it in better shape than it has ever been. The first two episodes are directed and written solely by Adlon, who shares writing duties as the season progresses. As Sam’s eldest daughter Max moves away to college, Sam wonders why she’s putting on weight. Then, there is a brief, terrifying brush with mortality. A lesser show would have made that the focus, or at least drawn it out beyond a few scrappy minutes. But Adlon’s scenes all end where in any traditional series, they might just get going, leaving the impression of snippets of life that ultimately all carry weight of some sort. In one moment there’s a joke about vanity, and getting carded in another, a near-death experience. Life is busy. Things happen.This has always been a comedy that has dared to try things out. Last season, Sam, feeling underappreciated by her children, staged her own eulogy, so they could talk about how much they loved her. As a concept, that sounds cloying and self-involved, but if Adlon ever dangles her storylines close to those edges, she yanks them right back with a pithy line, or another abrupt end to a scene. Instead, the fake funeral was gentle and moving and hilarious, because Better Things is sentimental without ever being trite, and, by contrast, painful when it should be soothing.It feels even more unencumbered by propriety or expectations this time, not least in Celia Imrie’s portrayal of Sam’s blunt mother and nextdoor neighbour Phil. Phil’s memory continues to decline and, again, on almost any other show, this drama would be front and centre, but here, it’s around the edges where the stories really happen. Phil neutralises a tense family argument with a well-timed fart: “Oh dear, I’ve made a pong.” When a pair of exes explain their new house-sharing arrangement, she chimes in: “Sounds awfully complicated. In my day we just stayed married and had affairs.”As the more viral corners of the internet know, children swearing unexpectedly can be hilarious. When Duke and Frankie’s bickering becomes unbearable, Sam tells them to let it all out: one minute of open, unmonitored hatred before civility is re-established. Frankie yells grievances about the perfection of her younger sibling, but Duke unleashes a torrent of creative filth that would make Selina Meyer blush. It is one of the funniest moments I’ve seen in a comedy in a very long time. And then, just like that, as the kids do, we move on.Better Things is often discussed as a show that paints an honest and raw portrait of motherhood, and of the complicated relationships between daughters and mothers, at any age. It does that, wonderfully, but there is a newfound confidence that takes it to a different level. Where the show explores the mundane, such as a school activities’ day, or a list of household expenses read from a credit card bill, it also revels in the surreal: Sam’s dead father is a recurring character. This is the charm of Better Things. Just when you think you know what to expect, it takes a different path."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49edb06cb3d9b61bc247b75ad35e724df5b45a48/100_0_1628_977/master/1628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=710cf11cc92e25d07b74635a8a1f6b3c","title":"the case against adnan syed what happened after serial","story":"In a new docuseries, the case at the centre of the phenomenally popular podcast is brought back into the light with sensitivity and insightBy the time that many viewers tune into HBO’s new documentary series, The Case Against Adnan Syed, many will be coming to the story with pre-conceived ideas about who Syed is and whether he belongs in prison. In some ways, the new documentary is indeed an extension of the phenomenally popular first season of Sarah Koenig’s podcast Serial, which offered intrigued listeners an immersive look at Syed’s murder conviction for the death of his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee. But while ads for the docuseries might lure viewers in with the promise of new evidence that will help to determine the truth, director Amy Berg, whose Catholic sex abuse doc Deliver Us From Evil was nominated for an Oscar, is ultimately less interested in drumming up scandal than in probing deeper into the unanswered questions of the case. While The Case Against Adnan Syed does provide viewers with a fascinating and important new look at Syed’s case, Berg’s careful work also fuses our insatiable drive for the truth with compassion for everyone who was touched by Hae Min Lee’s murder.Still, how do you de-sensationalize a story that has already gone viral? Today, we are more connected by social media than ever before, and fans of the original podcast series are already chomping at the bit to fight over whether or not they believe that Adnan did it. The spectacle of true crime stories in an age of hashtags is always a little disconcerting. On the one hand, podcasts like Serial and documentaries like The Case Against Adnan Syed have the potential to illuminate the very real and myriad problems of our criminal justice system and encourage essential social change. On the other, the ways in which armchair detectives can intrude on real life cases can sometimes veer into seeing other people’s pain as entertainment.One way that Berg contends with this phenomenon is by confronting it directly — in interviews we learn how, for Adnan’s family, Serial was a tremendous opportunity to raise awareness for the case and to work towards exonerating Adnan’s name. In contrast, we learn that for Hae’s family, the internationally renowned podcast series often felt painful in that it also prolonged the trauma of losing a loved one what they wanted a quick resolution to the crime, rather than the constant reminder of her death. Both family and friends express concern that aspects of the popular series seemed to flatten their beloved friend and family member into someone who had no identity other than a crime victim. Throughout Berg’s documentary we also learn the ways that witnesses called to testify were often concerned by ways they were discussed and depicted by an audience hungry for clues. In one particularly poignant moment, Hae’s friend, Aisha Pittman tells viewers, “I want to make sure that people remember that this was a person that lived and had a life and not just become so focused about, ‘this is an interesting case.’ It’s people’s lives.”In refusing to shy away from the less savory aspects of our cultural obsession with true crime, Berg deliberately uses the camera’s lens as a way to illuminate the humanity of everyone who was impacted by the murder, including Hae herself. When we are introduced to excerpts from Hae’s diary, the viewer is immersed in teen girl drawings, swirls of hearts and stars that capture the young student’s hopes, dreams, and fears. By making Hae’s art come alive on the page, we see a clearer image of a young woman’s humanity, which helps viewers to see Hae as more than just her yearbook image and prom pictures. Berg also wisely resists gruesome imagery or anything that smacks of victim blaming. The viewer is never shown too much when we learn key details about how Hae and Adnan would sneak off to motels without their conservative parents’ knowledge, nor do we see very much when we learn about how Hae’s body was found.This same type of gentle restraint is utilized as Berg conducts new interviews with family and friends who were impacted by the crime. While audio can absolutely be used to emotional effect, there is something uniquely compelling about seeing video footage of testimony, which allows us to linger more closely on the profound sense of grief and confusion that has shaken everyone involved in the case. We see lips tremble and eyes twitch and tears rolling effortlessly down cheeks that have aged considerably since the time of Hae’s death. Berg allows emotion to come naturally, rather than prodding or cajoling her subjects. If one of the most famous aspects of Sarah Koenig’s work in season one of Serial was the way in which probed her own feelings and reactions to the case. Amy Berg makes the opposite choice, in the first three installments at least, to make herself relatively invisible. In doing so, she allows a gentler unfolding of the story, one that is not only invested in the drive for justice, but the subtleties of grief and the ravages of time.In this same way, in The Case Against Adnan Syed we don’t just hear iniduals grapple with memory and loss we see that grappling on the screen. The result is a viewing experience that insists on ambiguity, even while teasing at a new resolution that many very well help to free Adnan from his life sentence. One thing is for sure: as the series progresses we see the many ways that police and prosecutors eager to for a quick conviction ended up mishandling or actively misrepresenting important information. In particular, it’s shocking to see how much the cell phone records that were used to piece together major aspects of the crime simply weren’t based on reliable information. Likewise, it’s incredible to see just how many of the people who spoke to police and the prosecution team felt manipulated and coerced. At one point, Adnan’s parents and brother reflect on a particularly heartfelt apology they received and discuss how they consider many of the witnesses and experts who were used to push a particular narrative about Adnan’s guilt to also be victims of this case.In the end though, Berg’s film does more than probe deeply into a 20-year old crime. It offers a critical and compassionate look at a story of young love and murder that briefly became a worldwide sensation, while also giving voice to the many people who insisted on continuing to fight for justice long after that very frenzy began to subside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aec3bdd101d90ce7019506f069eb76e9c8129fd/0_4_1461_877/master/1461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff9d880efe09bc362e7e8b015b7ec6bc","title":"fbi finds 2000 human bones indiana home ","story":"Bones were found to be a part of a collection of over 40,000 artifacts in the home of Don Miller, an artifacts collectorThe FBI has discovered about 2,000 human bones at the home of an extreme artifacts collector in rural Indiana.The bones were found to be a part of a collection of over 40,000 artifacts in the home of Don Miller, a second world war veteran and former electrical engineer, CBS reported Tuesday.The FBI started investigating Miller’s home in 2014 after the agency determined he may have illegally obtained items in his collection, potentially violating local and federal laws. Miller, who died in 2015 at the age of 91, was never charged with a crime for his artifacts.“When I first went into his house and saw the size of the collection, it was unlike anything we’d ever seen,” Tim Carpenter, head of the FBI’s art crime unit, told CBS.In recollections of his life told to the Indianapolis Star, friends and co-workers detailed Miller’s stories of traveling the world, doing missionary work and going on amateur archaeology expeditions. Miller told CBS in 2014 that he had traveled to 200 countries to collect artifacts.Miller displayed his finds at his house, inviting people to tour his collection as if they were visiting a museum. In a tour given to the Indianapolis Star in 1998, the paper reported Miller having bullets from civil war battlegrounds, a canoe from the Amazon River and two eggs “believe to have been laid by dinosaurs in China,” according to the paperThe FBI determined that half of Miller’s collection was Native American artifacts. Almost all the human remains are believed to be from Native American burial sites.Native American burial sites are protected under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which gives the right to determine what to do with artifacts found in burial sites and to those connected to their lineage. Archaeological digs of burial sites must also receive approval under the statute.Though prohibited by various state and federal laws, stealing items, including human remains, from Native American burial sites is not completely uncommon in the United States. Three men in Ohio were sentenced in 2016 for illegally selling Native American human remains, while a fourth was charged for purchasing the remains.“Unfortunately, there is somewhat of a market, not necessarily for the human remains themselves, but often times what’s buried with them,” Francis McManamon, founding director of the Center for Digital Antiquity at Arizona State University and former chief archaeologist for the National Park Service, told the . “Pottery, jewelry, other kinds of art objects that people will pay a lot of money for.”Since the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act was passed in 1990, the federal government has regularly prosecuted those who illegally obtain Native American artifacts, McManamon said. In 2009, the federal government indicted 24 people in its largest sting operation to crackdown on illegal artifact collecting. The FBI focused the operation on 256 Native American artifacts that it valued at $335,685.It’s unclear whether the FBI has determined that Miller violated the act. The sheer size of his collection may make it impossible to determine exactly what crimes were committed, according to the Indianapolis Star.An FBI spokesperson told the  in a statement that “efforts to identify and return the artifacts is ongoing”.Pete Coffey, an Arikara tribal official in North Dakota, is working with the FBI to bring remains found in Miller’s home back to the tribe.“All too often here we have been treated as curiosities rather than a people,” Coffey told CBS, noting the remains could very well belong to a relative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f50e877aabaef46bfd2e4aa39a88038c9bea230a/0_114_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e9696ab82dd0320d0d86550aee5451c","title":"venezuela bridge simon bolivar colombia maduro","story":"Venezuelan authorities have blockaded a second bridge to Colombia amid fresh skirmishes between protesters and security forces loyal to embattled leader Nicolás Maduro.The move came as opposition leader Juan Guaidó travelled to Brazil to shore up international pressure on Maduro following an inconclusive meeting of regional leaders in Colombia earlier this week.Early on Wednesday, two shipping containers were positioned across the Simón Bolívar bridge, a major pedestrian crossing between the two countries, following days of sporadic violence.The bridge was the focus of a failed weekend attempt to bring US food aid into the country as part of opposition leader Juan Guaidó’s campaign campaign to force Maduro from power.Dozens were injured on Saturday as anti-government protestors clashed with Venezuela’s national guard and pro-Maduro gangs at the bridge and another crossing near near the Colombian city Cúcuta. In circumstances that remain unclear, at least two trucks carrying the aid caught fire during the violence.Footage broadcast on Colombian television on Wednesday showed a burned-out truck bed in front of the shipping containers, which had been positioned overnight across the Simón Bolívar bridge.Last month, Venezuelan authorities barricaded the nearby Tienditas bridge with two containers and an oil truck. That bridge was finished in 2016 but never inaugurated.The Colombian border has been closed to most vehicles since 2015 following a string of disputes between the two countries, and on Saturday Maduro closed all Venezuela’s borders.Colombia closed four crossings from its side on Saturday evening, reopening them on Monday afternoon.Saturday’s aid effort was intended to weaken Maduro by triggering a flood of military defections. That did not happen, but Colombian migration authorities reported that around 250 military officials have crossed the border, joining a steady stream of Venezuelan refugees leaving the country via unpoliced routes.After Saturday’s violence, Guaidó – who has been recognized as Venezuela’s rightful president by the US and fifty other countries – travelled to Bogotá and met with the US vice-president Mike Pence and Latin American leaders.Guaidó, who was officially barred from travel, was set to arrive in Brazil late on Wednesday for a meeting with the far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, an outspoken opponent of Maduro.Maduro’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, will travel to Moscow for talks with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday. Russia has been among Maduro’s staunchest allies during the crisis.Meanwhile, unrest continued near Venezuela’s eastern border with Brazil after violence that left at least three people dead and dozens injured over the weekend.On Tuesday morning, soldiers took control of an airport in the town of Santa Elena de Uairén, which was the focus of clashes between Venezuelan soldiers and indigenous protesters.Witnesses say they were attempting to travel to Maurak, where members of the Pémon indigenous community had captured 30 soldiers on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Third work stoppage under way in dispute over trade union representation rightsVaradkar: publicly-funded hospitals need to recognise not everyone is CatholicHousing expert says people are spending less on food and education due to the cost of housingGovernment aims to reach UN targets by doubling amount spent on aid in next 10 yearsContractors begin removing tonnes of waste from Ellis\u0026rsquos Yard site in Ballyvolane this morningTaoiseach says cost of the plan has risen to \u0026lsquomany multiples of the original estimate\u0026rsquoDo sustainability rankings work or are they just self-congratulatory gestures?Minister to meet mother and sister of woman murdered, along with three sons, by husbandApproach to hearings involving voluntary organisations led to deep isions in PACResearch Lives: Dr John Regan, research fellow, Centre for Astrophysics and Relativity at DCU School of MathematicsMore than 5,000 patients registered on Ireland\u0026rsquos first registry for Barrett\u0026rsquos OesophagusReview group warns this could lead to serious effects and prolonged disruption for patientsHome for Good say wording should include right to dignity, shelter and safetyLack of support from committee for hearing, despite new Tusla concerns on child safetyIndependent report makes multiple findings against four senior Scouting Ireland figuresCourt rules public accounts committee acted outside remit when questioning ex-Rehab chiefTusla says lack of supervision on camping trips exposed children to harmBreakthrough not expected until mid-March making article 50 extension more likelyVaradkar pushes the due diligence message, while warning costs could be much higher"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3809654.1551350125!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cso baby names list features s%C3%ADneadh fada for first time","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhat’s in a name: The CSO is to treat síneadh fada “as significant for the purposes of name differentiation.”The Central Statistics Office (CSO) will pass a significant milestone on Thursday morning as it becomes the latest State agency to recognise the síneadh fada when it publishes its popular baby names list.The annual publication is based on the analysis of births registered with the State in a particular calendar year and since it was first published in 1998 the correct spelling of Irish names that include the síneadh fada has never been included. According to CSO data, the name Sean has featured in the top 5 boys’ names every year since 1998 but the statistics do not show whether the name in question refers to Sean or Seán.The CSO said feedback was received that “highlighted the dissatisfaction of some Irish speakers that wanted fadas included in the data”The agency said the change would treat síneadh fada “as significant for the purposes of name differentiation” and added that it “would confirm the position that the fada matters.”The failure by public bodies to recognise the correct spelling of citizens’ names and addresses makes up a sizeable portion of complaints made to the Coimisinéir Teanga each year.The síneadh fada is a central feature of Irish as it confers meaning and pronunciation upon words. It is also a strong determinant of identity as many Irish forenames feature the mark.Activists say the failure by State agencies to recognise the correct spelling of Irish names highlights the structural and cultural inequalities faced by speakers of the language when interacting with State institutions.The decision to reverse the practice of not recognising the síneadh fada was welcomed this month by the Coimisinéir Teanga, Rónán Ó Domhnaill.The coimisinéir said it highlighted the need for the Government to amend the Official Languages Bill “in order to place a responsibility upon public bodies to facilitate the síneadh fada”.While the baby names list will include the síneadh fada, an online app which allows users to research the instances of name usage going back to 1964 will not be updated in time for this morning’s publication. The CSO confirmed that the interactive app will cater for names that include the síneadh fada but said it will require more time to update the latest data set."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3808904.1551303386!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk eu rift on backstop widens as britain seeks changes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish and EU sources say the text of the Withdrawal Agreement provisions on the backstop cannot be changed. An anti-Brexit rally in Co Louth, January 2019. File photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireSignificant gaps remain between European Union and UK negotiators on the changes sought by the British on the backstop, according to sources briefed on the discussions.Senior Irish Government sources say they now accept that some sort of standalone document may be agreed to include EU clarifications on the backstop and guarantees that the UK will not be held in a customs union indefinitely.But Dublin is resisting the British description of the document as a “codicil” which implies a change to the legal nature of the backstop – the guarantee there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.Some sources say the British are using the term “codicil” in a bid to bolster the impact of any EU guarantees and assurances. But Dublin says that any new document cannot change the legal status of the Withdrawal Agreement.Nonetheless, Irish and EU sources say the British position has moved and is now much more “realistic”, by which they mean the British requirement that time-limit and a unilateral exit mechanism from the backstop be written into the treaty has been dropped.However, they warn that there is still a significant distance between the two sides, and any breakthrough is not expected until much closer to a series of votes in the House of Commons in mid-March.Brussels says that contacts are continuing “at a technical level” between the British and European Commission teams, led by Olly Robbins on the British side and Sabine Weyand for the EU.The British Attorney General Geoffrey Cox was in Brussels earlier this week and British reports stressed progress on changing the backstop, though EU sources played down talk of any significant breakthroughs.Irish and EU sources remain firm that the text of the Withdrawal Agreement provisions on the backstop cannot be changed, but say that a document containing EU guarantees about the backstop and the future relationship could be part of the package. An intensive period of negotiations is expected over the coming weeks.Some sources say that if there is to be an agreement on the changes required by the British, it is likely to come shortly before the votes in the House of Commons expected on March 12th to 14th.A draft agreement between the British government and the European Commission could then be voted on by MPs and, if passed, could be ratified by EU leaders at a summit in Brussels on Match 21st to 22nd. That would leave a week for the European Parliament to ratify the deal before the Brexit date of March 29th.However, given the stop-start nature of Brexit so far, not many sources express confidence that events will proceed according to this timetable, and an extension of article 50 is still widely expected.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Christophe MorinBloombergPresident Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday cast doubt on his and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s willingness to accept a possible vote in the British parliament to delay the UK’s departure from the European Union.“The withdrawal agreement between the UK and the EU] cannot be renegotiated,” Mr Macron said. “If the British need more time, we can examine a request for a delay if it is justified by new British choices. But we can in no event accept an extension without a clear understanding of the objective being pursued.“As our negotiator Michel Barnier says, we don’t need time,” Mr Macron continued. “We need decisions. The time has come for the British to make choices and give us what we deserve as partners, friends and allies, that is to say, a clear vision and a shared plan for the future.”One month after Mr Macron and Dr Merkel signed a new treaty on Franco-German cooperation at Aachen, the mood of their joint press conference was laborious, almost lugubrious.In EU parliamentary elections three months from now, Dr Merkel fears gains by the far-right AfD. Mr Macron hopes to avert a win by the far-right leader Marine Le Pen.Yet Europe’s two most powerful leaders barely alluded to the big issues: Donald Trump’s disengagement from Europe Vladimir Putin’s determination to undermine the liberal European project Chinese economic competition migration.Mr Macron’s assertion that the Franco-German relationship is “strong, efficient and enables us to … be the two essential actors of a European policy that is better and better co-ordinated” rang hollow.Mr Macron and Dr Merkel vaunted the same “achievements” they cite at every meeting, including the June 2018 Meseberg accord, which promised a budget for the euro zone, and plans to build a Franco-German fighter aircraft and tank.Franco-German relationsDr Merkel has braked Mr Macron’s ardour through long and fraught negotiations. He pleaded for a euro zone budget of tens of billions of euros. The agreement finally reached with Germany and approved by EU finance ministers last December falls far short of Mr Macron’s ambitions. It mentions only a “budgetary instrument,” whose characteristics are supposed to be defined in June 2019.Mr Macron called Franco-German defence co-operation “unprecedented” and said it is “progressing, advancing, with real work by our armed forces and our industrialists”.The German Spiegel Online website reported that the Aachen Treaty was almost not signed, because of a Franco-German dispute over policy on arms sales. Dr Merkel wanted an EU boycott on weapons sales to Saudi Arabia after the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. France considers that weapons sales are in its own strategic interest, and Mr Macron refused.France refused to allow restrictions on German arms sales to apply to materiel produced in joint projects. According to Spiegel Online, the Aachen Treaty was salvaged with a secret annex stating that neither government will attempt to block exports by the other.A recent crisis over the Nord Stream II gas pipeline between Russia and Germany brought Paris and Berlin to the brink of an open row. In the end, France compromised on a move to shift the power of decision from Germany to Brussels, but French recalcitrance was interpreted as a warning to Berlin.Mr Macron confirmed that the Dutch government had not informed France of its intention to equal Air France’s 14.3 per cent share of Air France-KLM. The announcement on Tuesday night was seen as hostile and comparable to a corporate raid. It was “up to the Dutch government to clarify its intentions,” Mr Macron said.Also on Tuesday, the Council of Europe’s human rights commissioner asked French authorities to refrain from using riot guns known as LBDs. Since he supports European decisions, Mr Macron was asked, would he comply with the recommendation?“The best way to avoid their use is for people to stop thinking Saturday afternoons are made for breaking windows, attacking institutions and the forces of order,” Mr Macron said. Gilets jaunes (yellow vest) protestors have demonstrated for the past 15 consecutive Saturdays.“I will not leave the forces of order with no means of ensuring public order or of defending themselves against people who come with weapons and the worst intentions,” the French president concluded.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Ho PruAFPGetty (Few at Westminster were expecting MPs to vote on Yvette Cooper’s amendment confirming Theresa May’s commitment to give them a vote on delaying Brexit if they rejected the withdrawal agreement. The government said the amendment was unnecessary but agreed to join opposition parties in supporting it on the basis that it echoed the prime minister’s own policy.But when the Speaker put the amendment to a voice vote, the No’s were just too loud to ignore and he called a ision. The result was illuminating, with 20 Conservative Brexiteers voting against the amendment and more than 80 more abstaining, along with all but one of the DUP’s 10 MPs.Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group (ERG) of Conservative Brexiteers, set pulses racing on Wednesday morning when he said he could vote for the prime minister’s deal even if the Northern Ireland backstop was not replaced.He told the BBC that the changes he sought to the backstop could be written into an appendix so that the text of the agreement itself would not have to be reopened.“Bear in mind, the Irish backstop is in itself an appendix to the treaty. So if you had a further appendix that said, ‘This will not go beyond a particular date’, and a short date, not a long date, then that would remove the backstop in the lifetime of parliament,” he said.“A changed deal is a changed deal. Of course, I would be open to considering that.”The EU is unlikely to offer an appendix that specifies an end date for the backstop but negotiators are working on further assurances that Britain will not be trapped within it indefinitely.Senior figures in the ERG acknowledge privately that if the changes to the backstop satisfy the DUP, all but a handful of the Conservative Brexiteers will support May’s deal.The 20 who voted against Cooper’s amendment could be most of the hard core that will oppose the deal regardless, a number that could be offset by Labour MPs who represent constituencies that voted heavily to leave the EU in 2016. Labour’s move to support a second referendum and fears that the EU will insist that an article 50 extension must be lengthy should concentrate Brexiteer minds ahead of next month’s meaningful vote.The DUP’s 10 MPs are pivotal and their judgment will determine the fate of May’s deal and perhaps the future of Brexit itself. And they’re saying nothing.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

session of parliament Thursday, in an overture towards New Delhi after soaring tensions fuelled fears of conflict between the nuclear-armed rivals.As a peace gesture we are releasing the Indian pilot tomorrow, Imran Khan said, a day after Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was shot down in a rare aerial engagement between the South Asian neighbours over the disputed region of Kashmir.The adversaries on Wednesday night and Thursday morning continued to trade fire over their disputed Kashmir frontier while Delhi demanded the return of its airman.In contrast to world leaders, who continued to call for the nuclear armed neighbours to show restraint, members of India\u0027s ruling party have called for more military action against Pakistan.The US said the risks from either of the adversaries taking more military action were “unacceptably high”.Delhi demanded the “immediate and safe return” of Wg Cdr Varthaman who was captured after his aircraft was lost during a dogfight with Pakistani jets on Wednesday.India called for the immediate and safe return of Wg Cdr Abhinandan VarthamanIndian anger over the suicide bombing of a security convoy that killed at least 40 paramilitary police in Kashmir earlier this month has prompted the most severe showdown between the neighbours in nearly two decades.India blames the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group for the attack this week launched air strikes inside Pakistani territory. Pakistan responded with its own strikes and the said it had shot down two Indian jets, capturing Wg Cdr Abhinandan.Pakistani police say troops deployed in the disputed region of Kashmir continued trading fire with India overnight, forcing villagers living near the contested frontier to flee to safety.Police official Mohammad Tahir says cross-border fire continued into Thursday but there were no casualties.Meanwhile Narendra Modi, India\u0027s prime minister, told a rally of supporters that his country\u0027s enemies were conspiring to create instability through terror attacksHe didn\u0027t mention arch rival Pakistan but said a united India would fight, live, work and win.The prospect of runaway escalation in the stand off between the nuclear-armed countries has sent alarm around the world.The potential risks associated with further military action by either side are unacceptably high for both countries, their neighbours, and the international community, said a White House National Security Council told Bloomberg.Donald Trump, the US president, was more upbeat, saying America had been involved in attempts to persuade the neighbours to climb down. “We have, I think, reasonably attractive news from Pakistan and India,” he said while in Hanoi. “They’ve been going at it, and we’ve been involved in trying to have them stop.”Strictly star Stacey Dooley in row

This is important because most scientists agree that any life on Mars would have to occur below the surface to escape the harsh surface conditions where high radiation, low temperature and lack of water make life unlikely.We found microbes adapted to high salt levels, similar to what may be expected in the Martian subsurface. These microbes are very different from those previously known to occur on the surface of deserts.Nasa finds new form of DNA in search for alien lifeBoth Nasa and the European Space Agency are preparing to send rovers to Mars in 2020. Those will roam over the surface and look for evidence of life, either in the past or the present, as well as drilling under the surface in an attempt to pull up any microbial life that might be hiding beneath there.Testing of this kind helps ensure that the missions succeed and shows that rovers should be able to deal with the harsh environment on Mars.The core of the Atacama Desert in Chile is extremely dry, experiencing decades without rainfall. It has high surface UV radiation exposure and is comprised of very salty soil. It\u0027s the closest match we have on Earth to Mars, which makes it good for testing simulated missions to this planet, said Pointing in a statement.The rover was put into the Atacama Desert to see if it would be able to pull up sediment samples as deep as 80cm\u0026nbspbeneath the surface. The samples it did gather were then compared with those taken by hand – and researchers found they were similar, suggesting that the rover was a success.The same test also found the microbes were living in patches across the surface, related to the difficult environment in which it was living.These results confirm a basic ecological rule that microbial life is patchy in Earth\u0027s most extreme habitats, which hints that past or present life on other planets may also exhibit patchiness, explain study co-authors Nathalie Cabrol and Kim Warren-Rhodes of The SETI Institute.While this will make detection more challenging, our findings provide possible signposts to guide the exploration for life on Mars, demonstrating that it is possible to detect life with smart robotic search and sampling strategies.Scientists now hope they can drill even further into the surface and see how deep microbial life might be able to thrive.Mars missions hope to drill to approximately 2m and so having an Earth-based comparison will help identify potential problems and the interpretation of results once rovers are deployed there, said Pointing.Ecological studies that help us predict the habitable areas for microbial communities in Earth\u0027s most extreme environments will also be critical to finding life on other planets.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now they\u0027re branching out so a lot of their businesses have been very good.With little real-world testing, it is difficult to say whether the usefulness of foldable phones will lead to them replacing traditional smartphones on any significant scale. Should this prove to be the case, however, Apple may once again hope that being late to the game pays off.There are already signs that Apple may be developing a foldable gadget, with a patent for a Flexible display device published earlier this month.\u0026nbspRenders\u0026nbspcreated by Dutch designer Roy Gilsing\u0026nbsphave imagined\u0026nbspwhat a folding Apple phone might look like.

International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) posted a 6.7 per cent increase in revenue, from €22.9bn (£19.6bn) to €24.4bn, while pre-tax profit increased by 11.2 per cent, rising from €2bn to €2.9bn.The company said the improved numbers came in spite of a jump in fuel costs, which were up 30 per cent over the year. IAG was also hit by a net foreign exchange impact of €129m in 2018. The group said it was continuing to “evaluate and prepare for the potential changes following the UK’s decision to leave the EU”.“As we move into 2019, there is continued political uncertainty, fuel price volatility and the ongoing risk of impact to our operations and reputation as the frequency, nature and sophistication of cyber attacks increases,” IAG said.Created with Sketch.

If you go back a year, people were saying ‘will we be able to fly at all?’ I dismissed all of that and I think I\u0027ve been proven correct.”Earlier this month, IAG placed a limit on non-EU shareholders, but said UK residents would be treated in the same way as those from the EU even after Brexit.Mr Walsh said: “This is nothing to do with Brexit. It\u0027s actually been in our articles since we created IAG back in 2011. It was in all of the merger documentation that we issued to shareholders and was approved by shareholders.”Shares in IAG rose 2.4 per cent in early trading.We’ll tell you what’s true.

He tells Andy Martin how he worked his way back to successClick to followThe IndependentBack in 2007, Queen Elizabeth II was shown, in a short clip, seemingly stomping out of a photoshoot with Annie Leibovitz, muttering under her breath, clearly bad-tempered, having taken offence at the suggestion she should take her crown off. Not scandalous, surely? No, but it was an early example of fake news. In fact, the Queen had arrived in a bit of a mood\u0026nbspbut had also enjoyed the shoot, and only unfortunate editing\u0026nbspturned it around and made more of a drama out of it. The tabloids then piled in and talked of betrayal or treason, calling for heads to roll.\u0026nbspOne of the heads belonged to David Frank, then chief executive of RDF Television, now cofounder and executive chairman of TRX (or The RightsXchange), an online marketplace for television.His head is still on his shoulders. He didn’t end up in the Tower of London. “It was a perfect storm of misfortune,” he recalls, sitting in a boardroom in Somerset House, a stone’s throw from the Thames. “Just an amazing cockup.” There was an out-of-the-blue phone call from the BBC\u0026nbspasking\u0026nbspif\u0026nbspthey had\u0026nbspany material that could be included in a showreel for their forthcoming documentary series, The Royal Family at Work. An editor noticed\u0026nbspthey had a tape – thrown together by way of a pitch to other TV companies elsewhere in Europe. It wasn’t supposed to be shown on television at all. But the helpful editor, unbeknownst to higher powers, had it couriered over to the BBC and the offending item duly appeared on the Nine O’clock News.Then, as Frank recalls:\u0026nbsp“The shit really hit the fan.” Apologies and resignations (including the controller of the BBC and RDF’s creative director) all round. “The BBC and ITV suspended operations with us, pending inquiries. Our share price collapsed. It went from something like 270 pence to 60 pence in a couple of months.” It was the worst crisis Frank had ever experienced. “We became the story.”\u0026nbspThe royal to do\u0026nbspbecame known as Queengate, or Crowngate.Created with Sketch.Queen Elizabeth II: Life in pictures  Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Queen Elizabeth II on a walk-about in Portsmouth during her Silver Jubilee tour of Great Britain, 1977The future Britain\u0027s Queen Elizabeth II (R) pictured with her younger sister Princess Margaret (L) in 1933The 9-year-old Elizabeth attends an aristocratic wedding with her mother and younger sister.

David Frank is the first CEO I’ve interviewed who once worked for The Independent. He\u0026nbspoffered me this encouragement: “The barriers to entering TV are incredibly low. It’s not that complicated, telly – no more than journalism.” He was born in Kenya in 1958, studied law at Oxford\u0026nbspand was employed as a lawyer for a grand total of 6 weeks until his exam results came through. Which is when he was fired. “I didn’t really fancy being a lawyer anyway,” Frank says. He went into investment banking\u0026nbspbut soon dropped out and started writing a column for The Independent\u0026nbspabout\u0026nbspcapital markets instead. He had a notion he could do something similar for television and applied for 20 jobs at the BBC but\u0026nbspdidn’t even get interviewed. Then, through a friendly contact, he fluked a job as a presenterinterviewer\u0026nbspdoing news and current affairs segments for a number of news programmes. “I loved all that,” he says. “But the BBC was anything but a meritocracy. You had to wait till somebody died before you could get a better job. There was a feeling of Groundhog Day.”So, begging, borrowing and not quite stealing the finance, he set himself up as an independent producer, RDF. He sold his first programme, to Channel 4 in 1993, about\u0026nbspindustrial espionage. “It wasn’t a very good programme, to be honest,” he says. “We had a small amount of footage and a lot of conspiracy theorists.” His younger brother Matthew, then a radio journalist, joined him on the sales side. They ended up making some classic series, such as Scrapheap Challenge\u0026nbsp(guys racing to put weird machines together out of junk). Their “human interest” stories (“mainly royals or mad\u0026nbspeccentric Brits”) sold around the world, notably anything to do with Princess Diana, pre- or post-car crash.But it was the Communications Act of 2003 that was the real gamechanger. The new legislation meant\u0026nbspterrestrial broadcasters would no longer own the programmes they commissioned, and the independents were free to sell their wares again and again. RDF already had its own sales house and became the outlet for 40 or so other independent programme-makers, selling rights on their behalf. They floated in 2005, with a turnover of some £40m, then hit the royal buffers in 2007. When RDF was sold to Zodiac, Frank moved over to become CEO of Zodiac. But he eventually resigned to set up TRX with his brother, a “next generation” company, in 2015. They have only a small and select staff. Their mantra is “More Deals, Less Hassle”. \u0026nbspDavid Frank radiates an almost zen-like calm and confidence and can laugh about past dramas. He and his brother Matthew are still best friends and go to watch Arsenal games together. They live within a few hundred yards of one another in Putney and avoid traffic jams by taking the Thames river bus every day to the Embankment and walking to Somerset House. TRX aims to make global TV transactions just as smooth and relaxing.A View From The Top: Kaidi Ruusalepp, founder of FunderbeamA View from the Top with Herschel Mayers, CEO of VitalityA View From the Top: Peter Simpson of Anglian WaterA View from the Top with Zia Yusuf, CEO of concierge service VelocityThe number of broadcasters has increased exponentially in the last 20 years. So has the number of programme-makers. TRX offers to put them all together, online, to provide a cloud-based platform for buying and selling rights. “If we’re successful, this could be worth billions,” says Frank. “I’m not that motivated by money, but the valuation of a company is a validation of what you do.” Frank doesn’t miss making programmes. “The nature of ‘creatives’ is that they’re difficult people to work with,” he says. “They’re short on compromise. That’s their strength. But managing them is hard work. I don’t have to do that here. Now we’re making technology, not programmes. It’s different, but I’m having more fun than ever. And it’s a lot better than Queengate.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Now it is in that situation\u0026nbspthere are others who also have claims upon its assets, claims that may take priority over those of the aggrieved customers.\u0026nbspWere this a savings company of some description that wouldn\u0027t be the case. There would be compensation available to anyone losing out through the savings industry funded Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).\u0026nbspTrouble is it doesn’t cover lenders even though the FCA has been regulating them since 2014.\u0026nbspAndrew Bailey, the boss of the FCA, says consideration has been given to including them but “in the event of the failure of a lender… customers generally don’t suffer losses. Loan customers are more likely to owe money to the lend rather than the other way round”.\u0026nbspIn most cases that’s true, but not in this one because of the way Wonga was carrying on.\u0026nbspAs a result thousands of people look set to be left out of pocket, calling that decision into question.So what next?Bailey makes the point that it would be a bit rum if the savings companies that pay into the FSCS were now called upon to bail out the past misconduct of a lender.\u0026nbspWhile some of them also are lenders, that’s by no means true of all them and so you’d be robbing Peter to pay for\u0026nbspthe misdeeds of Paul.

International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) posted a 6.7 per cent increase in revenue, from €22.9bn (£19.6bn) to €24.4bn, while pre-tax profit increased by 11.2 per cent, rising from €2bn to €2.9bn.The company said the improved numbers came in spite of a jump in fuel costs, which were up 30 per cent over the year. IAG was also hit by a net foreign exchange impact of €129m in 2018. The group said it was continuing to “evaluate and prepare for the potential changes following the UK’s decision to leave the EU”.“As we move into 2019, there is continued political uncertainty, fuel price volatility and the ongoing risk of impact to our operations and reputation as the frequency, nature and sophistication of cyber attacks increases,” IAG said.Created with Sketch.

If you go back a year, people were saying ‘will we be able to fly at all?’ I dismissed all of that and I think I\u0027ve been proven correct.”Earlier this month, IAG placed a limit on non-EU shareholders, but said UK residents would be treated in the same way as those from the EU even after Brexit.Mr Walsh said: “This is nothing to do with Brexit. It\u0027s actually been in our articles since we created IAG back in 2011. It was in all of the merger documentation that we issued to shareholders and was approved by shareholders.”Shares in IAG rose 2.4 per cent in early trading.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Many of M\u0026ampS’s customers\u0026nbspthat want online grocery shopping\u0026nbspare already Ocado customers, he says.“It may have overestimated the lure of M\u0026ampS products, and indeed the questionable benefits of being able to order an M\u0026ampS dress with a weekly shop.”\u0026nbspThe new tie-up can be a success but only if M\u0026ampS sticks to the premium products it’s famous for like, says George Lawrie, principal analyst at market research firm Forrester.“In other words, it will work for champagne, fresh oysters, canapes and caviar, but not for things like cling film and carrots,” he says. This marries with Ocado’s vision of a premium delivery experience, with smartly dressed drivers delivering your groceries straight to your kitchen table.Luxury deliveries work better because of cost, Lawrie explains.“Normally you’d expect picking, packing and transporting produce to amount to around 25-30 per cent of the cost of a single item, a cost that high margin retailers can absorb but low margin grocery cannot – unless everything is highly automated.”M\u0026ampS clearly can’t compete with the big supermarkets when it comes to customers’ weekly shops, says Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management, which holds shares in M\u0026ampS.He is also pessimistic about the deal, describing the £600m M\u0026ampS is raising to pay for the new venture as an “extravagant use of shareholders’ money”.“The motivations behind this deal for M\u0026ampS are clear, as the company has long struggled with an online offering that is not up to scratch.”The benefits to M\u0026ampS of an online food shopping are not certain because of the limited range of products it stocks, says Mumford. Consumers see it as a place to top up their weekly food shop with premium items, rather than somewhere for a large weekly shop.But that’s not so much a problem as it might once have been because Ocado has become less dependent on Waitrose products and now stocks broad range of own-brand and private label products, says Stephen Lienert, senior analyst at Jefferies.“Ocado therefore goes full circle: whereas before people used Ocado to access Waitrose products, now the supermarkets want to use Ocado.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Many of M\u0026ampS’s customers\u0026nbspthat want online grocery shopping\u0026nbspare already Ocado customers, he says.“It may have overestimated the lure of M\u0026ampS products, and indeed the questionable benefits of being able to order an M\u0026ampS dress with a weekly shop.”\u0026nbspThe new tie-up can be a success but only if M\u0026ampS sticks to the premium products it’s famous for like, says George Lawrie, principal analyst at market research firm Forrester.“In other words, it will work for champagne, fresh oysters, canapes and caviar, but not for things like cling film and carrots,” he says. This marries with Ocado’s vision of a premium delivery experience, with smartly dressed drivers delivering your groceries straight to your kitchen table.Luxury deliveries work better because of cost, Lawrie explains.“Normally you’d expect picking, packing and transporting produce to amount to around 25-30 per cent of the cost of a single item, a cost that high margin retailers can absorb but low margin grocery cannot – unless everything is highly automated.”M\u0026ampS clearly can’t compete with the big supermarkets when it comes to customers’ weekly shops, says Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management, which holds shares in M\u0026ampS.He is also pessimistic about the deal, describing the £600m M\u0026ampS is raising to pay for the new venture as an “extravagant use of shareholders’ money”.“The motivations behind this deal for M\u0026ampS are clear, as the company has long struggled with an online offering that is not up to scratch.”The benefits to M\u0026ampS of an online food shopping are not certain because of the limited range of products it stocks, says Mumford. Consumers see it as a place to top up their weekly food shop with premium items, rather than somewhere for a large weekly shop.But that’s not so much a problem as it might once have been because Ocado has become less dependent on Waitrose products and now stocks broad range of own-brand and private label products, says Stephen Lienert, senior analyst at Jefferies.“Ocado therefore goes full circle: whereas before people used Ocado to access Waitrose products, now the supermarkets want to use Ocado.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 315 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 515 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 615 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s.

Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1415 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 215 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 315 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 515 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 615 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 915 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all.

But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” So, the initial emphasis will inevitably be on the vast back catalogues of\u0026nbspboth companies, going back to the 1950s. In principle, a viewer might chose to watch every episode of Coronation Street since it was first shown on\u0026nbsp9\u0026nbspDecember\u0026nbsp1960, or the 5,875 episodes of EastEnders made since 1986. Either would make for\u0026nbspquite a binge.\u0026nbspEvery Morse, every Doctor Who (at least the ones where the tapes haven’t been wiped), every Avengers, and every Dad’s Army\u0026nbspevery Morecambe \u0026amp Wise show, every recent hit drama such as The Night Manager or Vera\u0026nbsp– all would be available on demand, for a subscription fee.\u0026nbspIn due course, though, the BBC and ITV hope to\u0026nbspcommission new series especially for BritBox, just as competitors such as Netflix\u0026nbspand Amazon do. How and when these series might find their way onto their conventional channels is unclear. Other things being equal, like many digital content providers in every field, they would have to offer their subscribers something special,\u0026nbspwhich is not available for free elsewhere, to justify the fees.How much will BritBox cost to the viewers?There is speculation that it might be as little as £5 per month, though this has not been confirmed, beyond the BBC and ITV saying it will be “competitive”. As with other streaming services, it might be available direct or via other data providers, such as BT in the UK.In principle, given the BBC’s charter, major licence fee funding might be problematic. ITV have pledged some £65million initially the BBC will not comment\u0026nbspon its financial commitment.Why are the BBC and ITV doing this now?The truth is, they have little choice. Streaming of high quality programming, using the Internet (and or satellite and cable) and bypassing traditional broadcasting methods, have caused massive disruption. Younger viewers, especially, are more likely to use the likes of Netflix, Amazon and YouTube for their video entertainment than they are to\u0026nbspsettle down with a cup of tea and a biscuit in front of Emmerdale or Newsnight. BBC to air rival Leaving Neverland Michael Jackson documentary ITV and the BBC\u0027s BritBox streaming service has potential BBC invites public to take control of its Brexit coverageThis fragmentation of the market is something that conventional broadcasters such as ITV and the BBC have dreaded for years – the moment of “peak television”, beyond which\u0026nbspviewing figures start to decline.The traditional broadcasters are also attracted by the prospect\u0026nbspof establishing a worldwide presence. Netflix, for example, has 56 million users – about the population of the UK. If BritBox can become a global player, then new possibilities for programming open up. Netflix commissions well over 100 new series a year – more than anyone else on the planet. If BritBox succeeds, it will create a virtuous circle where new shows attract new subscribers, and the revenues from their fees and any accompanying advertising is used to commission more shows, which will attract more viewers, and so on.If anything, the move is overdue. The new kids on the block\u0026nbsphave been eroding the BBC and ITV market share for some years. An attempt to create something like BritBox in the UK at the start of the decade was blocked by the competition authorities. They no longer seem inclined to do so.Will it succeed?Well, the BBC and ITV have a superb record when it comes to\u0026nbspcreating hit drama series\u0026nbspin particular, many of which have been popular worldwide. Comedies, documentaries, nature and arts programming might also attract major new audiences through the new platform. The BBC also has a global reputation for impartial and investigative\u0026nbspnews-gathering – an increasingly precious asset in a world of “fake news”.\u0026nbspMassive global hits such as The Crown (Netflix) or Game of Thrones (HBO) could easily have been made by the British broadcasters\u0026nbsp– but they now lack the financial heft to do so. To give one example,\u0026nbspthe budget for each episode of Amazon Prime’s The Grand Tour is about £4.5million for the BBC’s Top Gear it is £500,000. Why Roma’s awards-season success is such a big win for NetflixThe Beeb\u0026nbspand ITV are simply\u0026nbspbeing out-done commercially if not artistically. They are too small and too focused on the UK in what has rapidly become a globalised business.So the talent (Olivia Colman, as a symbol), the creativity and the expertise are all there – London is already a world centre for post-production and the UK has excellent film and studio facilities. What may be lacking is the business acumen that could really make the new service a success. ITV and BBC executives are simply too parochial and inexperienced in this field – as opposed to programme-making and dealing with awkward MPs – and would need to require some potentially expensive (possibly foreign) commercial nous to pilot them to success, just like Premier League football teams.Alternatively, in the longer run, they might consider forming some sort of more cooperative relationship with the\u0026nbspestablished streaming services, though again that would bring its own complications, not least because of the BBC\u0027s status as a state-owned broadcaster with no private shareholders and a unique agenda.Can I watch the very latest episodes of Emmerdale or Endeavour on there?Probably not. The idea is that the most recent and live material will still be broadcast on-line via the BBC’s existing iPlayer and ITV\u0027s Hub service (for all their various channels, including radio in the case of the BBC).What about Brexit?BritBox could be a pioneer of the new “global Britain”, an international player in a fast-developing market concentrating on the kind of value-added creative content that the world will pay good money for. British programming and show formats have traditionally sold well abroad, and this would be a massive extension of that tradition. Early days, but BritBox could be transformational.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).However, fans of the film discovered that the Netflix version does not have the nurse discovering they are dead, therefore leaving viewers on a more uplifting note as they just lie in bed together.Responding to fan outcry on Twitter, the streamer wrote on Twitter: “Things you should know\u0026nbsp– we did not edit the notebook – an alternate version exists and was supplied to us – we are getting to the bottom of it asap – apparently some films have more than one ending?”Meanwhile, The Independent recently debuted the first trailer for the Netflix series The OA, which you can watch here.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearRumours of the wallet\u0027s inclusion on the device\u0026nbspcirculated amid a surging cryptocurrency market, which had previously seen months of dropping prices since the highs of late 2017.Several other smartphone makers have included an in-built cryptocurrency wallet with recent devices, including the HTC Exodus 1\u0026nbspand the Sirin Finney,\u0026nbspthough none have the global reach of the South Korean electronics giant.Little fanfare was made of the new feature, with no mention of it during Samsung\u0027s Unpacked event last week. Only one line in its accompanying press release made mention of it.Galaxy S10 is built with defense-grade Samsung Knox, as well as a secure storage backed by hardware, which houses your private keys for blockchain-enabled mobile services, it stated.HTC Exodus 1: The phone taking on the entire internetOne of the cryptocurrencies supported by the Galaxy S10\u0026nbspwallet is cosmee, a cryptocurrency produced by Korea-based blockchain firm Cosmochain, who partnered with Samsung for its dApp.Cosmee describes itself as a beauty social media platform that allows users to share content among other members. While it appears like a standard smartphone app on the surface, the key difference is that it will run on a peer-to-peer network – much like bitcoin.\u0026nbspThis means people\u0027s data will be spread across this network, rather than being stored on a centralised server. Users will also be able to earn rewards in the form of cosmee cryptocurency by actively participating in the community.Cosmee already has more than 30,000 daily active users in Korea, the firm tells\u0026nbspThe Independent, making it the second most popular beauty app in the country.\u0026nbspCan Norwegian waterfalls stop bitcoin from destroying the planet?The inclusion of such apps is anticipated to push cryptocurrency adoption even further into the mainstream, as people will ultimately be able to spend it and trade it on a daily basis. Contactless payments with cryptocurrencies could also be a possibility in the future, as the Galaxy S10\u0026nbsprange supports this functionality.Still more is needed before cryptocurrency becomes truly mainstream, with the final stumbling block mentioned by Mr Thomas being that of regulation.

Due to a lack of knowledge about the past climate of Mars, scientists\u0026nbspcan not tell whether it came from\u0026nbspgroundwater, precipitation,\u0026nbspmelting glaciers or something unheard of.There is no liquid water on the surface of mars today, though plenty of similar ex-water features\u0026nbsphave been discovered in recent years, suggesting Mars once had a far wetter and warmer climate.Each discovery raises further questions about the planet\u0027s past atmosphere and\u0026nbspscientists ultimately want to know whether or not it would have been suitable for life.Next year the ESA in collaboration with Russia’s space program Roscomos will launch the ExoMars mission with the primary goal to “address the question of whether life has ever existed on Mars.Here The Independent has collated images\u0026nbspfrom recently discovered evidence of water on Mars in the gallery above.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The firm now claims to have more than 500 million monthly active users across 150 countries.The FTC\u0027s complaint alleged that\u0026nbspTikTok\u0026nbspfailed to get consent and also did not delete personal information when parents requested the firm to do so.\u0026nbspUnder the Children\u0027s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), apps and websites aimed at children are required to obtain parental consent in order to gather their data.\u0026nbsp“The operators of Musical.ly – now known as\u0026nbspTikTok\u0026nbsp– knew many children were using the app but they still failed to seek parental consent before collecting names, email addresses, and other personal information from users under the age of 13,” said FTC chairman Joe Simons.This record penalty should be a reminder to all online services and websites that target children: We take enforcement of COPPA very seriously, and we will not tolerate companies that flagrantly ignore the law.TikTok said in a statement that it cares deeply about the safety and privacy of our users, adding,\u0026nbspThis is an ongoing commitment, and we are continuing to expand and evolve our protective measures in support of this.A spokesperson for\u0026nbspTikTok\u0026nbspwas not immediately available for comment on whether such measures would be introduced outside of the US.​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Due to increasing numbers arriving for work and study, non-EU net migration is now at the highest level since 2004.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliament“In contrast, EU net migration, while still adding to the population as a whole, has fallen to a level last seen in 2009. We are also now seeing more EU8 citizens – those from Central and Eastern European countries, for example Poland – leaving the UK than arriving.”The statistics were released after Sajid\u0026nbspJavid\u0026nbsppledged the government would back a move to protect the rights of EU citizens living in Britain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.ONS figures show that 121,000 British people left the UK in the year to September, compared to only 85,000 arriving, leaving a deficit of 35,000 people.Labour will table bid for second Brexit referendum within a fortnightThree-quarters of graduates think Brexit will negatively impact careerWhat happens to UK citizens living in the EU under a no-deal Brexit?Overall EU net migration stood at 57,000 after 145,000 European citizens left and 202,000 arrived.People from EU8 countries, including Poland, Slovakia, Lithuania and Hungary, left in the highest numbers, with 53,000 departing in the year. Net migration from outside the EU was 261,000.The ONS said that there were fewer people arriving for work overall, but more for study with non-EU student immigration at its highest level since 2011.“The decrease in work-related immigration over the last two years can be largely accounted for by the recent fall in the number of EU citizens arriving with a definite job and the previous fall in the number of EU citizens looking for work,” a report added.Tej Parikh, a senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said large companies were recruiting workers from outside the EU to compensate for a loss of EU employees.“With job vacancies at record highs, recruiting from abroad has never been more crucial for British businesses,” he added.“Already, firms across the retail, hospitality and construction sectors are facing obstacles as some EU workers are returning home, while it’s also becoming harder to attract labour from Europe amidst the uncertain political climate.”The UK granted asylum, alternative forms of protection and resettlement to almost 15,900 people in the year ending December 2018, with rises in grants for Turks and Libyans, but falls for Iranian, Eritrean and Sudanese nationals.Diane Abbott MP, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said: “Once again the number of migrants coming here vastly outstrips the government\u0027s unworkable 100,000 net migration target.\u0026nbspIts policy is not really about reducing numbers, but allows it to maintain a constant campaign against migration and migrants.“Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, said: ”The UK is continuing to attract and retain highly skilled workers, including more doctors and nurses, while talented international students are benefiting from our world leading universities and boosting our economy.\u0026nbsp“However, we are committed to controlled and sustainable migration.\u0026nbsp As we leave the EU, our new immigration system will give us full control over who comes here for the first time in decades, while enabling employers to have access to the skills they need from around the world.\u0026nbsp“We’ve always been clear that we want EU citizens to stay here, and the EU Settlement Scheme is making it simple and straightforward for EU citizens to get the status they need.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote. We have campaigned for it, we have marched for it and we will vote for it.”With dissatisfaction over Brexit having sparked several Tory and Labour MPs to quit their party and form the Independent Group, Sir Vince said he has been speaking to “many of these now independent MPs” and that they have “much in common” with his party.Created with Sketch.

We need to close these issues down and we do it by being absolutely vigilant in the way we deal with racism in our own ranks. That\u0027s on all of us.Labour deputy leader Tom Watson\u0026nbspwas on the Today programme this morning and he did not mince his words.On\u0026nbspthe suspension of Chris Williamson, he said: He\u0027s entitled to a fair hearing but I\u0027ve been very, very concerned that his comments have almost been deliberately inflammatory and causing offence to not just parliamentary colleagues but people in the Jewish community who understandably have a real concern about antisemitism in the Labour Party.Asked whether anyone from Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s office had argued against suspension, Mr Watson said: I can\u0027t confirm that. I\u0027ve no idea who said what in Jeremy\u0027s office. I honestly don\u0027t know that.I\u0027ve asked to see Jeremy on Monday next week to talk about how we can further improve our measures to deal with antisemitism.When Luciana Berger left the Labour Party, I thought it was the worst day of shame in the Labour Party\u0027s 120-year history. A pregnant young MP bullied out of her own party by racist thugs.Arch Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0026nbsphas suggested he is softening towards Theresa May\u0027s deal - as the threat of a delay to Brexit ramps up.Writing in the Daily Mail, he said: The Prime Minister says it is still her fervent hope that the UK leaves the EU on March 29. I share her sentiments.If – and I stress if – she can secure the necessary assurances on the backstop I have outlined, I would be delighted to support her deal and help avoid any delay to Brexit.It is not my job to tell other Conservative MPs what to do, but I am sure many other passionate advocates of Brexit would take the same pragmatic and patriotic view.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s politics liveblog, where we will be bringing you the latest updates throughout the day.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Just holding out possibility of a short delay, too short for a #peoplesvote” she tweeted.Significantly, the prime minister refused to say whether she would “argue for no-deal or argue for extension”, if her deal is thrown out again on 12 March.Labour’s Yvette Cooper hinted she would continue to press her amendment tomorrow, to legally compel Ms May to seek an Article 50 extension if her deal is not approved.Suggesting the legal force was crucial, Ms Cooper warned: “Promised votes have been pulled before, Commons motions have been ignored before.

Other brewers use the name of a deity in their beers so I obviously never thought anything bad about it.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Chapel, at Windsor Castle, on May .Prince Harrys mum Princess Diana died in a car crash in Paris in .Speaking to Newsweek, he recalled the decision — made on his behalf — for him to follow his mum Diana’s coffin after her death.Harry said: “My mother had just died, and I had to walk a long way behind her coffin, surrounded by thousands of people watching me while millions more did on television.“I don’t think any child should be asked to do that, under any circumstances.”Harry has also previously revealed he battled with depression following his mums tragic death.He said he “shut down all his emotions” for two decades after losing his mother Princess Diana.The Prince admitted he had been close to a breakdown, sought therapy and took up boxing to combat frustration.According to

but MPs rejected it in January.Theresa May headed to Brussels on February  with fresh plans to fix the hated Irish border backstop.Eurocrats have privately hinted they are open to tweaking the wording to reassure MPs and help get a deal passed.If Parliament cannot support a deal - and there is no extension - the UK will leave the EU without a deal on March .That would mean the UK being treated as a third country by the EU with commerce governed by World Trade Organisation rules, experts say.Some Brexiteers say that could be positive - opening up trade with the rest of the world - but many people fear chaos.On January , Boris Johnson said that a No Deal Brexit is the closest to what people voted for in the referendum.He also urged Cabinet Ministers to mirror the British publics optimism and self-confidence for the possible exit scenario.A poll by YouGov on January  revealed that  per cent of the British public think a No Deal Brexit is likely,  per cent think a failed deal will result in a second referendum,  per cent said the deal will pass and  per cent said a better deal could be negotiated.Brexiteers say it would be a boost for the UK to be free from Brussels rules and we will be able to strike deals with other upcoming nations around the globe.We would also not be obliged to pay the £billion orce bill, according to a House of Commons report — but Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked fury by saying we would pay up even without a deal.Many people fear the UK economy would be hurt by a clf edge Brexit as trade is held up by new border checks and tarfs and more red tape for businesses.Doom-monger Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned house prices could crash by a third in a worst-case scenario.Customs checks on cross-Channel freight could cause havoc at ports, hitting food supplies and other goods such a motor parts.The Border Force is also planning for a possible No Deal Brexit as they fear there will be signicant outbound queues at the Eurostar and a degradation of border security, Sky News reported.In a pure No Deal Brexit scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.The  mile frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic could become a hard border, according to Eurocrats in Brussels.The EUs rules may require Ireland to impose customs and other checks to protect the bloc’s border – which some say would mark ato the dark days of the Troubles.It could blow a hole in the Good Friday Agreement, with pressure on all sides to find a compromise.The Confederation of British Industry also said a No Deal Brexit would wipe £billion off the UK economy, making every region poorer, the Daily Mail reported.Theresa May has a Withdrawal agreement that has been negotiated with Brussels.But MPs rejected it when it was voted on in parliament in January.Mrs May suffered the biggest parliamentary defeat of any British Prime Minister when the Withdrawal agreement was rejected by a majority of .She announced another vote will be held by March  - just over two weeks before Britain is due to leave the European Union.Negotiations are still continuing over the hated Irish backstop which aims to prevent a hard boarder in Northern Ireland.Parliament have voted that she must seek alternative arrangements to prevent a hard boarder.Ministers announced plans for troops on the street and emergency ferries to cope with a No Deal Brexit.They will order businesses and families to start preparing for Britain to leave the EU without a deal and release £billion of extra spending.Businesses will receive a -page document, with a total of , firms likely to hear from the Government over the next few days.The news comes as:Theresa May’s Government plunged into utter disarray over Brexit just  hours before a crunch Cabinet meeting over Britain’s future.In December , Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted Britain could “flourish and prosper”it walks away from the EU with No Deal.As bitter Brexit battles rage on:Businesses received a -page document about Brexit, with a total of , firms likely to hear from the Government.The papers show:The decision will mean putting off Britain’s EU exit by weeks or months  MPs still haven’t passed a new orce agreement in two weeks time.On Monday night, three Remain Ministers warned as many as  could quitshe fails to commit to delaying Brexit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/TM-comp-Andrea-Leadsom-Graph.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"andrea leadsom brexit finishing line","story":"It tends to be closely followed by a dozen other questions about what I’ll do in “x” scenario, or whether I’ll resign“y” happens.But the thing that gets me out of bed in the morning is the same thing that drove me into national politics nearly a decade ago — and that is to help the UK become an even greater force for good in the world.We can only achieve that with a strong and united government which collectively seeks to deliver on the ­referendum and trusts in the path we set out.I believed in , as I strongly believe now, that we have a bright future of independence ahead of us.Like so many other people in the UK, I took the chance offered to us in a ­single ­question: Should we leave the European Union or remain within it Following a great deal of thought and thorough analysis, the answer I arrived at was: “Yes, we should leave the EU.”Like so many of my ­generation and those younger, I have spent most of my le in the EU and my instincts were naturally for reform from within.I believed in a number of the EU’s core values — the promotion of peace, global trading opportunities and the ­values of freedom and democracy.These are areas in which our great country leads the world.But with the good came the bad and the ugly — the bureaucracy, the waste, the ever-closer union, the diminishing of our own sovereign power.In co-founding the Fresh Start Project, I spent the years preceding the referendum up close and personal with the EU.I saw first-hand the things that worked and the things that didn’t, and the project team delivered a manesto for change to then-Prime Minister David Cameron, suggesting ways to fundamentally reform the EU for the better and reverse the road we were going down.His renegotiation was finalised three years ago almost to the day — and it’s safe to say that despite his best efforts, the reforms proposed were deeply ­disappointing, with a real lack of ­ambition.So when the EU’s denial of the need for reform and their intransigence to the PM’s reasonable proposals became clear, the decision I should take was made blindingly obvious to me. We should leave the EU and forge a new path in the world.It was put to a referendum and the rest, as they say, is history.For some, though, the result of the ­referendum is not history. It’s something they are desperate to re-run.Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent — but so too is mydetermination, and the ­determination of this Government, to deliver on the will of the first one.Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.It’s about compromise and accepting that while we might disagree with each other, we should respect each other’s views.That need for compromise is precisely why we continue to negotiate with the EU. The Prime Minister is fighting hard to make sure we leave with a good deal on March .That determination is the reason I believe that the Conservative Party is the only party delivering in the national interest.The Prime Minister has made clear through her actions that whether you voted Leave or Remain, the deal she seeks will look to bring everyone back together.Whether you are someone who can’t wait to see us leave the EU, or whether you wish the result of the referendum had been dferent — we all, each of us, just want the best for the UK.We have a bright future ahead and one in which the UK will continue to grow as a force for good in the world.The pressure isn’t all on Parliament.The EU needs to come to the table in the spirit of compromise too.It would be the most illogical act of senseless harmthe EU refuses to accept that the UK Parliament will not be trapped in a backstop and instead pushes us to leave with No Deal, thereby ­creating the exact problem with the Northern Ireland border they claim they want to avoid.As far as our current ­negotiation is concerned, we are well into extra time.As Leader of the House, I am responsible for passing the legislation necessary for our exit from the EU.We have a lot to do before March  but I remain confident thatwe resolve the backstop, we will be able to pass the Meaningful Vote and crack on with that vital ­legislation.We are so close to the ­finishing line, so my plea to politicians here and in ­Brussels is: Please don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The EU must lt its eyes and look beyond the current frustrations and towards the close friendship we all want in the future.The Labour Party must carry out the wishes of the majority of its own ­voters, who wanted to leave the EU.And my own colleagues on the ­Conservative benches must not make the perfect the enemy of the good.Don’t hold the PM to ­ransom at such a critical point.Instead, we must hold our nerve and push through.  We must hold fast to the reality of the PM’s deal — that it delivers us a clean exit from the EU and all of its ­institutions while at the same time ­offering a close trading and security partnership that addresses the hopes and aspirations of many in our country who voted Remain.So the prize is great — and it’s all of our futures.Let’s come together and, with one final heave, we can get the PM’s deal over the line and begin to look ­forward, not ­backward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The last thing Mrs May needs now is Cabinet rebellions, backbench grandstanding and a leadership beauty contest.Too many Tories seem not to realise what damage they are doing to the party’s hard-won reputation for competence when they go completely off-grid.Or to faith in politicians and our political process in general when they fight tooth and nail to stop Brexit, but aren’t even honest about their intentions.Theresa May has a tough job for the next two weeks. The least her Party can do is let her get on with it in peace.EVERY insight into what a Corbyn government would look like makes the prospect even more terrying.This weekend he, again, brushed off the anti-Semitism in his party as a matter of personal opinion. And then he had a go at the media for asking why more and more MPs in his shrinking party say he’s unfit to lead Great Britain. Approved questions only, please.Even the supposedly sensible ones on his front bench appear to have left the reservation. Emily Thornberry reckons she’d rather die than join another political party.

For years it has rubbished claims that it has been over-run by racist anti-Semites and rabidly hard-Left conspiracy lunatics. Now ­Corbyn’s ally Jon Lansman, founder of Momentum, admits that it’s all true.“We have a major problem,” he says. “It is obvious we have a much larger number of people with hardcore anti-Semitic opinions... polluting the atmosphere in constituency parties and online.”Deputy Leader Tom Watson is in open revolt, launching a “party within a party” to prevent more moderates defecting.It may be too late. Corbyn’s own anti-Semitic extremism attracted all the racists and cranks who have forced out one Jewish MP and her colleagues. All the while he has faced both ways on Brexit.If he is about to pay the price for it all, it is well deserved.FOR too long we have allowed the supporters of terror to wave their sickening flags during protests on our streets.Enjoying free speech protections, they have spread the lies and vicious hatred of one of the world’s most violently anti-Western and anti-Semitic groups.Police have had to let goons march through London with Hezbollah banners emblazoned with an assault rle.Tory Home Secretary Sajid Javid has outlawed them entirely.

Officially, it has been muted for repairs but you could not be blamed for wonderingthere was a dferent reason.Has this most resonant symbol of parliamentary democracy been gagged — had its clacker nicked — while our appalling, promise-shredding, treasonous politicians plot to overturn the  referendum’s whacking vote to leave the European Union Almost three years ago the voters gave MPs a clear instruction: Get us out of the EU. Unbelievably, the MPs are refusing to obey.Whatever tricksy waffle they spout, be in no doubt about this. The parliamentary class is telling voters to get stuffed.The last  hours have seen British politics sink to a new, squalid, guttering low.In clear daylight the express will of the people is being violated.Democratic honesty is being casually abandoned by a knot of pro-Brussels obsessives who think they can do whatever they like. And they suppose we won’t notice!Cabinet ministers yesterday tarted their Remainer consciences like dollybirds flashing their bits on Blackpool beach.Led by Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, they threatened to resignTheresa May did not do their bidding and delay our departure date from Europe.Oooh, look at us, their blatant behaviour said. Look at our importance and our Europhile goodness. All this while they accused pro-Brexit MPs of being “extremists”.Is it really extremist to respect the biggest vote in British history In any normal circumstances, a Prime Minister would have turned to Rudd and her fellow drama queens Greg Clark and David Gauke and said: “OK, resign. If you won’t support the Government, you can kiss goodbye to your six-figure salary, your free limos and all the other perks.”But Mrs May, pitiably weak, tolerated their rebellion and trotted off to the Commons to accept Brexit may be delayed.It wasn’t just Rudd, non- entity Gauke and Clark, a former SDP supporter who has resented the Leave vote from day one.A trio of lower-ranking ministerial numpties put their names to a newspaper article saying they would quit unless Mrs May obeyed their pro-EU agenda.These connivers included an insufferably moist specimen called Richard Harrington, who is barely a familiar name in his Watford constituency let alone in national politics.Even a premier as puny as Mrs May should have had the backbone to tell Harrington to fetch his coat. But no. He was allowed to keep his job.Things are just as bad in the Labour party, where ­Jeremy Corbyn has casually scrapped his  manesto promise to respect the result of the EU referendum.Now he says he wants a second referendum. You thought the one thing loonytunes Corbyn had going for him was that he said what he believed A manesto should matter. It should be a solemn undertaking to the voters about what politicians will do.But Corbyn, supposed beardie prophet of ethics, now snootily thinks we voted the wrong way in the referendum and must capitulate to the European empire, ditching the national independence .million voters demanded.Why the hell are these people in politicsthey think so little of the voterswho opted for Leave Theirs is the behaviour of a tyrannous clique whose “delay” to our departure helps only their fellow technocrats in the European Commission.And that’s what it’s all about. They feel a greater kinship with their fellow elitists on the Continent than they do with working-class British voters.The likes of Greg Clark and Amber Rudd and their slippery pal Philip Hammond looked smug yesterday when Mrs May announced the possibility of a delay to Brexit.For them, it’s a game, a ploy, a bid to show that they — and not the unwashed electorate — run the show.Can they not see the dangers  Respect for Westminster, already whacked by the expenses scandal, will take another terrible hit. People will look at the wriggling and the grand- standing and the lies and procrastinating blether of the last day and a half and will conclude that our Parliament is now a place that scorns its electors.Some of you may have greater faith.Some of you may say: “Brexit will prevail in the end”, albeit in diluted form.But eventhat is true, what are we to think in future of the House of Commons Things have reached the stage, I am truly sorry to say, that I now find I hate the very sight of Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster.It is no longer, for me, the proud cockpit of our national le.It has become a nest of aggressive, desperate elitists prepared to do anything to save their greasy grasp on public opinion.They lie.

The Labour leader called Hezbollah his “friends” during a controversial parliamentary meeting with them in .Mike Gapes – who quit as a Labour MP last week – said yesterday’s statement proved Jeremy Corbyn was “unfit” to be Prime Minister.Sajid Javid extended a ban on Hezbollah’s military wing to its political arm on Monday – saying it was vital to “protect the British people”.Jewish groups had urged Ministers to close the loophole as it allowed Hezbollah’s flag to be flown on Britain’s streets during marches.The Home Secretary insisted the Lebanon-based Shia group was continuing in its attempts to destabilise the fragile situation in the Middle East.But Labour yesterday claimed Ministers didn’t have the evidence to back up their move and the decision would strain diplomatic relations with Lebanon.A Labour spokesperson said: “The Home Office has previously ruled that there was not sufficient evidence that the political wing of Hezbollah fell foul of proscription criteria, a position confirmed by ministers in the House of Commons last year. Ministers have not yet provided any clear evidence to suggest this has changed.”The spokesperson added: “The Home Secretary must now demonstrate that this decision was taken in an objective and impartial way, and driven by clear and new evidence, not by his leadership ambitions.”Home Office aide Racheal Maclean said Labour’s stance was “shocking”. She said: “It’s shocking but not at all surprising that Corbyn fails to stand up to appalling terrorists and anti-semites who beyond any doubt seek the destruction of Israel and their allies.”Labour’s London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Monday said the ban was “long overdue”.Tory deputy chair James Cleverly last night stormed: “There has long been cross-party cooperation on national security, but Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party continues to reject the values that once united people across the political ide.“His refusal to back our decision to ban the antisemitic terrorist organisation Hizballah is yet another example of why even ex-Labour MPs think he is not fit to lead the Labour Party, let alone the country.”Labour last night said it would not oppose Sajid Javid’s “overall” motion which also called for the proscription of Jamaat Nusrat al Islam Wall Muslimin and Ansaroul Islam.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This route of transmission is more likely because of increasing bat-human contact.In fact, he goes on to say that the likelihood of bat flu infecting livestock and humans is probably high, due to the fact that bat-borne flu viruses are quite common around the globe.Importantly, because of increasing human contacts with wildle, including bats, consumption of bat bushmeat and hunting bats for both food and money has exposed humans to the zoonotic spillover of viruses.Muhammed says that eating bats could put us at risk of other viral and bacterial infections.So its a no to eating bats , and a watch this space to seeany livestock have fallen victim to bat flu."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000406141674-e1540908854709.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"universal credit migration lose cash","story":"Delays to rolling out the new welfare system mean that between , and , people will be forced to apply for Universal Credit by  -

which hasnt yet started - will get help to make sure they dont lose out.But  per cent of households are on track to lose £. per week under Universal Credit, and wont be able to access transitional protection cash while they move over.The experts recommended that the DWP make Brits on benefits aware of any changes in circumstances that could force them onto Universal Credit, so they can make informed decisions on their future.Those most at risk of losing out are the self-employed on low incomes , home-owners who get tax creditsor households with savings who then go onto the new system.Zoe Charlesworth from Policy in Practice said today: People should be able to check what impact a move to Universal Credit will have on their income before making le changing decisions.And the emphasis should be on cushioning the shock to those households.The organisation is concerned about people who are getting student grants and loans, old industrial disabilities and spousal maintenance on the old system -

The entertainment giant would not have let him go unless it had to.Yet Disney chief executive Bob Iger paid tribute to Lasseter, saying he had taken “breathtaking risks” in his work, “telling original, high-quality stories”.Only once he was truly gone did one staff member feel brave enough to speak openly about his reign of sexism.Graphic designer Cassandra Smolcic said: “When I started at Pixar as an intern, I thought I’d landed my dream job.But my excitement was quickly tempered by a flood of warnings about Lasseter’s touchy-feely, boundary-crossing tendencies with female employees.”She claimed he would letch after women and touch them in “unwanted” ways.Her superiors feared Lasseter might try something on with Cassandra, but rather than punishing him she says they punished her.Cassandra alleged: “Just after starting on Cars , I was told by a superior that I’d be uninvited from all our weekly art department meetings because Lasseter ‘has a hard time controlling himself’ around young women.”It is staff like Cassandra who Emma believes should be protected from Lasseter.Skydance, which has made Baywatch, several Mission: Impossible films and the two most recent Star Treks, had it written into his contract that he should behave professionally.This did not reassure Emma. She wrote: “If a man has been touching women inappropriately for decades, why would a woman want to work for himthe only reason he’s not touching them inappropriately now is that it says in his contract that he must behave ‘professionally’ ”No criminal charges were ever levelled at Lasseter.When he joined Skydance in January, he spoke to staff for  minutes, trying to reassure them he was a changed man.He also told them he was working with a therapist to help him overcome “unconscious bias”.This reflected another allegation made against him during his time at Disney — that he had promoted men rather than women.Most notably Lasseter replaced Brenda Chapman with Mark Andrews as director on Brave, even though she had come up with the idea of the Scottish princess.Female animators are far from convinced that the industry will become safer and fairer for them.Marge Dean, of pressure group Women In Animation, said after Lasseter had been given his second chance: “The announcement triggered in me the same feelings that I’ve had in abuse situations... I felt disregarded and trivialised.”For now — to paraphrase Buzz Lightyear’s catchphrase in Toy Story — it seems Lasseter’s career has already gone to infamy and beyond. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That would be a democratic disaster.Yes, this Government has made a catalogue of errors from triggering Article  with no plan, to letting Brussels decide the sequencing of Brexit talks.But at this stage, with the clock ticking towards midnight, there is no time for “coulda woulda shoulda” about what went wrong when.Sun readers knew all along that in a negotiation there’s always give and take.You can’t get everything you want.And although the Prime Minister’s deal has flaws, it’s actually far better than many critics will admit.Those same critics can also be wildly unrealistic about the actual alternatives on offer now.The most likely alternative is in fact a far softer Brexit, which leaves Britain with less not more control.ImagineDavid Cameron had won from Brussels a deal that took back control of immigration, let us set our rules covering the key services sector, and allowed us to scrap the wasteful Common Agricultural Policy.Let’s suppose it gave us control of our fishing waters, let us choose environmental and employment laws as long as we kept to certain general standards, and which got us out of the EU’s political project. He would have been a hero.Yet that is precisely what Theresa May has secured. Even in a worse-case scenario —we end up in the backstop — we will have achieved all those things and will get a veto over new EU directives.We wouldn’t have to pay a single penny of membership costs.I’m not pretending the deal is flawless. We need to improve it to know we can’t be trapped in the backstop forever, and to ensure the EU can’t impose dferent rules in Northern Ireland from the rest of our country.But it sometimes seems that the Prime Minister’s critics cannot see the wood for the trees.Eurosceptics used to say what we wanted was to turn off the tap of endless new European laws, to stop the ratchet where the answer to every question seemed to be “more Brussels”, and to go back to a trading relationship. That’s ­literally what this deal does.So why did her deal suffer such a ­historic defeat last month Some MPs have deeply held concerns, particularly about the backstop, that the Government is rightly trying to address. Some are pursuing perfection. Others — especially in the Labour Party — are just playing politics.But there’s also a group for whom the real issue is personal as well as the policy.They just don’t have faith in the Prime Minister. This is no big secret.More than a third of Tory MPs —  of them — voted against her leadership back in December. To get through that, Theresa May had to promise she wouldn’t lead the party into the next election. But now she may have to go further.I’ve heard senior backbenchers on all sides of the Conservative Party say that their concern about voting for the deal, is that it could mean the Prime Minister stays in place to negotiate our future relationship with the EU.They want someone  to take forward the next phase.If Theresa May manages to agree a deal — and I think she ultimately can — she will have achieved Mission Impossible.But to scrape that deal through the Commons she might, as Sun columnist James Forsyth has suggested, have to throw the kitchen sink at it by agreeing to step aside.Downing Street aides privately acknowledge that she doesn’t want to “go on and on”. They know she faces another inevitable and painful leadership challenge by the end of the year — they want to see her leave with her dignity intact.It’s likely Brussels will eventually give some reassurance on the backstop.This might not quite be the full ­open-heart surgery changes to the deal some want.But the test should be whether the legal position changes. If it does, then the deal deserves to pass.And then, come the end of March, we can stop endlessly re-running referendum arguments about whether we should or shouldn’t leave the EU.We can get on with arguing about what sort of country we want to be after Brexit.We can discuss what we want to do with our newly won ­freedoms.And as a country we can start to move on together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I also saw a lot of Disney figures which you could win.“We barely touched anything, because there is radioactive dust.“Its a unique location, because you normally dont get to see a SEGA arcade hall which is fully intact.“I only noticed vending and cash machines were pried open by looters.“Normally they would take out the prizes and sell the arcades.

They will instruct the Government to negotiate a long enough delay for either.Some of the same Brexiteer MPs who helped bring about our historic decision in  are now in grave danger of destroying it, along with their own legacy.Rebel MPs were also handed the power to delay Brexit by even longer than three months on Wednesday in another climbdown by the Government.Under the threat of another immediate revolt, former Tory ministers Nick Boles and Sir Oliver Letwin forced Mrs May’s de facto deputy David Lidington to agree a Commons veto on theof any Article  extension.Remainer rebels were jubilant.Ex-Tory Cabinet minister Dame Caroline Spelman said: “The Government has just confirmed acceptance of all the proposals in our amendments.“There will not now be a No Deal Brexit in  days’ time because there is not a majority in the House for crashing out without a Deal.“We will not plunge over the clf on th March into an abyss, making the country poorer in every sense of the word.”Ex-Tory party leader Iain Duncan Smith said no one had expected Yvette Cooper to move her amendment – and it appeared to cause utter confusion among Tory whips.IDS added: “I told them what is the party doing and he said the payroll is voting for.“I said I’m not and abstained.

They werent actually being asked to approve a delay - only to pave the way for a vote on one happening on March . But despite this,  Tories directly rebelled by voting against even having the chance to delay Brexit. And another  did not cast a vote on the House of Commons amendment - the vast majority deliberately refusing to vote. It comes amid reports of chaos among Tory MPs over which way they were supposed to vote.   The amendment reiterated Theresa Mays strategy, but it also prompted confusion, because it was tabled not by the Prime Minister but by backbench MP Yvette Cooper. Brexiteer David Davis voted in favour of the plan, allegedly by accident. One minister reportedly told Chief Whip Julian Smith to his face: “You don’t know what you’re doing.” Despite the rebellion, Brexiteers have shown signs they may compromise and back Theresa Mays Brexit deal. That could give it a slim chance of passing by March  - meaning the chance to delay Brexit will never arise. And as virtually all other MPs are in favour of the plan that could delay Brexit, last nights amendment passed -.But regardless, the Brexiteer rebellion was intended as a powerful signal to Theresa May that Tory MPs arent just going to simply fall into line. Yvette Cooper tabled an amendment confirming a three-step plan by Theresa May that could lead to delaying Brexit. Those steps are: March : Vote on Theresa Mays Brexit deal. By this date, the government will hold a new meaningful vote on the -page Brexit deal. If it passes, Brexit happens with a deal, almost certainly on March  . If it fails, or theres no vote, move to step . March : Vote on No Deal Brexit. By this date, Theresa May will table a Commons motion asking MPs for their explicit consent to leaving the EU with no deal. If they give consent, we leave with No Deal on March . If they dont give their consent, move to step . March : Vote on delaying Brexit. On this date, MPs will hold a vote on whether to delay the date of Brexit by up to three months - to the end of June.

Well, its definitely less showy than Prince Harry, sixth in line to the throne and the Queens grandson.   Baroness Jessica Heydel, who appeared on MTV reality TV show The Royal World, revealed the code name.She told the Daily Mail: I met Prince Harry once on a night out, probably four or five years ago.His friend introduced him as Rob.

Adele Barbour tragically died as a result of the collision on the A near Lincoln. The -year-old passed away in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest at the wheel. Questions were raised by coroner Marianne Johnson about the actions of emergency workers who mistakenly thought she was pregnant. An investigation was launched by the East Midlands Ambulance Service. Miss Barbour died on January  last year as she had pulled in front of a Toyota Yaris while trying to turn right. She had been indicating right off the A when she pulled in front of the Yaris travelling on the other side of the road. Miss Barbour had a cardiac arrest and was rushed to hospital. A statement by Miss Barbours sister Sarah-Jane Spence at the inquest said she was incredibly proud of my big sister, adding that Miss Barbour was a much-loved auntie to her two boys.   Mrs Spence also spoke of her sisters courage and determination even as a child. She said: She was unable to walk at all until she was seven years old but this never stopped her - she got around on her bottom. She added: She is sorely missed by all of us. Questions were raised by coroner Marianne Johnson at the inquest into her death on the actions of emergency workers who mistakenly thought she was pregnant. A C-section was carried out at the hospital because they thought she might have a baby due to her protruding stomach - only for them to discover she was not pregnant. At an inquest held at the Lincoln Cathedral Centre, a collision investigator was called to give his report on the circumstances of the crash. PC Mark Brown said in his evidence: “Adele Barbour has failed to give way at the junction. She has pulled into the path of a Toyota Yaris across in the south-west-bound lane. “For an unknown reason she has not seen the oncoming Toyota Yaris. “Adele Barbour was driving her black Vauxhall Meriva on the A Lincoln Road at Nettleham. “She had started to turn right and has failed to give way and driven into the path of an oncoming Yaris.   “The other driver was confronted by a car in her carriageway and had no way to avoid it. “There is no evidence that herdriving caused the collision.” At the inquest, a post mortem investigation gave the medical cause of deathas a laceration of the aorta. Witness Nicola Ware was one of the first on scene of the collision. She was driving to work as a paramedic for East Midlands Ambulance Service. When she arrived, she said Miss Barbour was sitting conscious in her car and complaining of back pain. She said: “I went towards the car that Adele was in. I asked her name and said that I was an off-duty paramedic on my way to work. “I asked hershe had any pain and she said that she had pain in her back and that she had a pre-existing back condition. “She did not mentionshe was pregnant. She had a large puffa jacket on so I had no reason to believe that she was. “I proceeded to the other car and I phoned the control roomto explain that I would be late and I was told it would be a while before getting a crew on the scene. “Another lady at the scene then shouted me back across to Adele as she thought she was fitting. “She was unconscious but she had a pulse and she was breathing. “The fire service arrived and I asked them to help me to get her out of the car and she went into cardiac arrest.” Other paramedics from the private medical group Elite EMS and LIVES also arrived at the scene to help.  Staff who arrived on scene raised concerns that Miss Barbour may have been pregnant due to a protruding stomach so precautionary measures were made while giving her CPR. The inquest also heard evidence from James Bidwell from Elite EMS, Chris Cole, a paramedic at LIVES, and Emma Haskey, a clinical support manager at EMAS. A GP report read out at the inquest said that she had received major surgery in  for spina bida and was also diagnosed with chronic leukaemia in . In all of the live evidence given, it was heard that the decision was made to move Miss Barbour to Lincoln County Hospital due to her unstable state and repeat cardiac arrests, unavailability of the air ambulance and the possibility that she may have been pregnant. Evidence from Emma Haskey heard at the inquest said: “In a pre-alert to the hospital, I informed them there was a female patient after a road traffic collision with a query to whether she was eight months pregnant and that I would update them with more information when I could. “Later I was updated by the emergency operations centre who told me that a C-section was carried out and the patient was found not to be pregnant.” Sam Smith, from East Midland Ambulance Service, concluded: “In my opinion from the evidence I don’t think that the crew could have done any more than they did. “I would not recommend a dferent course of action.” Coroner Johnson said: The evidence that I have heard is that the initial mis-diagnosis [of pregnancy] did not cause or contribute to her death. It appears all efforts were made in her care to try to save her but her injuries was so severe the outcome was inevitable. My conclusion is that Adele died as a result of a road traffic collision.

When you sell your pictures, a statement gets sent to you, with a breakdown into subscriptions, tips and messages from fans. The first time it came through, I was so shocked. I never intended on this being long term, it was only temporary until I got a new job as I needed some money to tidy me over. Now though, I upload every day. Its pretty much a full time job.

Our family friend, who runs the pub, found out and told my dad. He told my mum, but she already knew. He was more concerned than anything, my mum was concerned at first too, but shes more relaxed now - and my gran even supports it.   Without having a clear direction for selling her selfies, Lottie, who also currently volunteers part-time, is taking every day as it comes and does not rule out her new hobby as a career. She added: Ive been approached to do some modelling work but thats never really taken off. If the opportunity is there, I would take it.

Dave Hazel, , was set to marry his online lover Linda Smith but ended up being scammed out of his le savings. The warehouse worker met Linda on a dating site in  and spent a year chatting online and speaking to her on the phone. After falling head over heels, Dave was convinced she was going to move from Canada to the UK to be with him. But he was soon embroiled in a web of lies with his online lover demanding more and more money from him.   Dave, from Kings Lynn, Norfolk, quickly forked out his entire le savings of pound, but soon after realised Linda was based in Ghana, Africa. She then cut all contact with him and completely disappeared. Singleton Dave, who wanted to start a family with Linda, is now speaking out for the first time about being scammed online. He said: After losing almost pound, I was heartbroken - I had been ready to start a family with Linda. I had been speaking to her online for  months but despite not meeting her or using Skype, we had spoken on the phone.   I met her on a dating site and she looked like someone Id met in London and she said she remembered meeting me. We began building up a relationship, having conversations daily - she introduced herself as Linda Smith. I even rang her and she spoke with an accent that sounded more English than Canadian. Before I knew it, I was falling for her - my heart had melted and she was lovely. She wanted to live with me and I thought I was in love. Dave made arrangements to meet Linda, but things started to unravel and she quickly started demanding more funds. The bachelor said: The first thing she asked me for was a VISA costing pound. I was ready to have a full relationship, and I was happy to help her.  She asked me to send it through Moneygram - which works almost like PayPal and two weeks after that it was another pound for a medical check. She said she would marry me and have children - she was promising everything Id always wanted. Yet Daves dream was about to be destroyed as the money requests kept coming in, eventually reaching more than pound,. Dave paid for what he believed were plane tickets, visa complications and more - fully believing she was on her way to finally meet him. Yet his suspicions were finally aroused when she asked for flight tickets from Ghana. Dave said: I thought she was coming from Canada but when I asked for proof of the tickets they said she was coming from Ghana.  I asked her to explain - and she said shed just been visiting. But then I got a phone call from immigration in Ghana after shed been detained for having a large amount of money on her person. They told me the person I was waiting for wasnt coming and was being arrested. Dave decided it was time to investigate properly, a staggering two years after hed first spoken to Linda. Upon visiting his local bank, it was quickly discovered that all the paperwork, which showed email correspondence between Dave and Linda and evidence of where Dave had sent his money to, proved Dave had been victim of a scam.  Staff also told him there was no way he could get his money back, as he had voluntarily sent it and it couldnt be traced. Dave added: It was the darkest period of my le - I asked themthey were joking, I couldnt have been conned. I didnt trust anyone and couldnt speak to anyone for months. Without Victim Support - a service which offers initial support and information to victims of crimes like mine, and assessed your needs going forward - I wouldnt be here. Ive learnt you should always ask for advice, andyoure sending money without seeing them, stop. Dont be ashamed - youre not the only one - these cons left me heartbroken and its taken me years to fix things.

Sir David Manning, , was received by the Queen at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday afternoon upon relinquishing his appointment, the Court Circular recorded. The key aide joined William and Harrys household a decade ago in , when the brothers royal profile was growing, and he went on to mentor Kate and, more recently, Meghan. Kensington Palace said William, Kate, Harry and Meghan were incredibly grateful for his guidance and paid tribute to his wise counsel.   It is understood that Sir David is stepping back now that the couples are well-established in their international work. His post was seen as unique and so will not be replaced. A spokesman for the Cambridges and Sussexes said: Their Royal Highnesses are incredibly grateful for the guidance and support that Sir David has provided over the last  years. His wise counsel has been central to the success of their international tours and the early stages of their official work as members of the royal family.

They now want to warn others after their two-year-old son could have been blinded and had to spend four days in hospital last month. Lorna Hoy, , and Andy Briggs, , first noticed small red spots forming on their son Kalos face, chest and arm. After being dismissed twice by doctors, Lorna claims it wasnt until their third attempt to seek medical advice their concerns were taken seriously. Kalo tested positive for the herpes simplex virus - something doctors suggest he caught through kissing an infected adult.  The mum-of-four is now sharing her story to raise awareness for the virus, which,not treated, can be fatal in children. Thankfully Kalo has since made a full recovery after his time in hospital. Lorna, from Salford, Manchester said: I never thought this would happen to our family. Kalo had red spots all over this face, chest and arm before he was diagnosed with herpes. He had ulcers in his mouth and needed injections in his eyes to ensure the infection hadnt spread to them as this couldve blinded him. I have heard of babies dying from catching this virus which is awful and I think the only reason Kalo survived is because he was just under two at time.   I hope our story serves as a warning to other parents as it could happen to anyone. Kissing children on their mouths and sharing cutlery is a common way to catch herpes, as its spread through saliva. Kalo - who was admitted to Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester on January  - needed an intense course of IV antibiotics in a bid to rid him of the infection. Andy, a bus driver, added: Kalo had struggled to eat days before his diagnosis which was a real worry for us as parents.  But thanks to the amazing care of the doctors and nurses he began eating yogurts as he began to recover.Lorna shared the pictures of Kalo via Facebook to raise awareness for the infection and it went viral.We want to encourage people to research the virus and look into its causes to prevent their children from going through what Kalo did. The couple who have three other children, Jayden, eight, Kaci, six and Jenson, four, and hope the pictures of Kalos face will help raise awareness. Lorna said: Since getting home has been getting along great and is finally back to his good self however the scars have remained on his face from the sores he had while in hospital.  We would all like to say thanks to the staff who cared for Kalo in one way or another at Wythenshawe Hospital. As a family never thought this would happen to us but were so lucky that Kalo pulled through after his treatment. I hope through sharing our experiences of it that we prevent others from going through the same.

Mr Justice Hayden said the couple believed only in the power of prayer, the Manchester Evening News reports. Although he did not grant their wishes, he said he respected their opinion. The judge was told that the youngster, who is being treated at theRoyal Manchester Childrens Hospital, had been born with kidney failure and had survived against the odds.   Specialists say she has one chance for ongoing survival - hemodialysis, a process through which blood is cleaned. They say the treatment carries risks but is worth trying. The girls parents are against the idea and say her fate should be left in the hands of God. Mr Justice Hayden on Wednesday gave specialists the go-ahead to try hemodialysis after analysing evidence at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. The judge said the little girl had proved herself to be a fighter. He said she had earned her chance and ruled that hemodialysis would be in her best interests.   Mr Justice Hayden, who oversaw the case at a public hearing, said the girl, who is being treated at the Royal Manchester Childrens Hospital, could not be identied. He said he had been enormously impressed by doctors commitment to the youngster. The girls parents said they were not in support of hemodialysis. She has been fighting death since she was born, the girls mother told the judge. We are not in support. She has gone through a lot. Mr Justice Hayden was told that the couple had mental health issues. He said he respected their point of view. Mum and dad are opposed, he said. They have a deep, profound and simple faith. They believe only in the power of prayer.

And the mum-of-three, from Withernsea, near Hull, was horried to hear from her youngest son, aged just three, that the children’s videos he’d been watching on YouTube were full of blood and gore. Speaking to , Sophie, , said she had become worried about Harry after he had suddenly started to become distressed when he had to leave her, even dropping out of after-school activities. She said: “For the past few weeks he has been terried to leave my side.   “It got so bad he wouldn’t let go of the car door when it came to go to school, sobbing. He dropped out of all of his after-school clubs. He didnt want to be away from me. “I have a one-year-old daughter who is disabled, and we’ve been going to sibling support, so I took him to talk about it. We didn’t know what might have caused him to be so frightened to be away from me.” Sophie said she had asked her two sons, aged five and three, where they had heard of Momo after becoming away of the sick online ‘suicide game’, but they always denied knowing about it. Alerts have been issued about the so-called Momo challenge, which has been linked to several child deaths. Momo - a terrying bug-eyed doll with straggly hair and a devilish grin - reportedly encourages children to harm themselves and even to take their own lives. Sophie said: “Obviously I never showed Harry the picture, and when he kept saying, ‘no, I haven’t heard of it’, I believed him. “Then on Tuesday night, in the middle of a conversation, he started randomly telling me what the picture looked like. “I said to him, how do you know what it looks likeyou’ve never seen it, and he just burst into tears and was terried. “He just kept saying that he didn’t want to talk about it. I had to convince him that no-one would get hurthe told me.   “So he sat down and told me he’d seen Momo several times, while watching YouTube videos. He watches videos of Peppa Pig, and people playing Minecraft and Roblox, just normal videos I thought weren’t at all harmful. And he said Momo just comes up in the middle of it. “He told me it was a secret, and that the videos told him he was a naughty boy, and not to tell me becausethey did it would hurt his family members. “After he had spoken to me he wouldn’t leave my side, just like he had been these last few weeks. He was really scared.” Sophie said she got another shock when she told her other, younger son that he could no longer watch his favourite Peppa Pig videos on YouTube. She said: “He said, ‘what the red ones  The ones with knives and blood ’ I didn’t know there were Peppa Pig videos out there showing blood and violence. I was horried. “I had to convince him that no-one would get hurthe spoke to me. He said Momo turned up in the middle of the videos he watches, Peppa Pig and people playing Minecraft and Roblox. “He told me it was a secret and that she’d told him she would hurt his familyhe told us. “It made me really upset that I’d allowed him to see these things, I was shook up because I’d never seen him so frightened.”  Sophie said: “I had a lump in my throat when I heard that. It made me feel really upset that I’d allowed them to see these things, just to think what it was doing to their heads. “I was shook up to see my son so frightened. It was so hard to hear. I’m sure that these things are behind his bout of separation anxiety. He was terried of losing me.” Other parents have revealed how their own children have been left terried and in tears after being targetted by Momo. KirbiLeigh Hecker told how she had caught her daughter Layla searching for her paracetamol tablets, saying Momo had told her thatshe didn’t swallow  she would kill her parents.Mum-of-two KirbiLeigh, from Hartlepool, wrote on Facebook : “I’m absolutely mortied.“I asked them when they got in from school, do they know anyone called Momo off YouTube, they instantly started crying. After Layla calmed down I asked her what does it do.” She posted a video of their conversation, as her daughter tells her “She kills people, mums and dads. “If we do not listen she kills our parents saying they have to take paracetamol for our parents to live.” And Elli Spicer told on Facebook how her five-year-old son Ronnie had threatened to stab his classmates after watching videos featuring the evil doll. The mum-of-two from Dover, Kent, said she was called into his school around four weeks ago after he threatened two other kids, but has since discovered he had been exposed to Momo without her knowledge. She wrote: “I’m absolutely devastated. “In the car on the way home from school yesterday, I asked Honey or Ronniethey knew what ‘Momo’ meant  “Honey instantly looked in my mirror at me and went Eww Mum I have she’s got a smile like joker  big scary eyes - Ronnie just sat there staring at me. Honey said she’d never watched a video of this sick freak telling her to do bad or dangerous things but that she’s popped up in loads of innocent kids videos on YouTube, where her neck twists round or she’ll walk across the screen! “Ron refused to tell me at first not taking his eyes off me in the mirror and was completely in denial about ever seeing this ugly c***. “He’s been wetting the bed and he’s been coming into my bedroom early hours because of scary dreams! I am absolutely gutted, I honestly thought my children were quite sheltered.” Schools across the country have started warning parents to be extra vigilant over the disturbing phenomenon which is designed to avoid detection by adults. And police today issued a warning about the “suicide game”, which they claim is being used by hackers to harvest information from children.

An autopsy revealed little Bella Redondo died from two skull fractures. The baby’s mother Katy Fernando described the horric call during Nydia Carillo-Maldonado’s sentencing on Wednesday. She said: I will never forget the calls you made to me that day. I heard her screams in the background. That was the last thing I heard from my Bella. I will never hear her call me mommy, but I heard her cry in pain while you sat there for hours without doing anything to help her.  Katy Redondo and her husband Fernando almost did not attend -year-old Carillo-Maldonado’s sentencing, because they are furious with Carillo-Maldonado’s sentence of just three and a half years over the July  crime. The killer, of Stamford, Connecticut, was allowed to admit first-degree manslaugher, even though Bella’s death was ruled a homicide by blunt force trauma to the head. Police have not shared further information on how Bella came to acquire the two skull fractures, the Stamford Advocate said. Sentencing, Judge Gary White suggested that Bella had died due to her babysitter’s carelessness, saying: Nobody is saying this defendant intentionally harmed this victim.   But it was her recklessness and misconduct that this child died. Despite admitting causing Bella’s death last year Carillo-Maldonado declared I did nothing wrong’ during the sentencing hearing. That prompted a judge to consider rejecting her plea. She did not address the court or offer an apology to her young victim’s parents, NewsCT reported.   The parentsattorney Mark Sherman said: Theyre appalled that there was no contrition, no remorse, no Im sorry, Theyre grateful to the police, states attorney, for working on this case for three years.It was a challenging case because there was no acceptance of responsibility by the defendant. Carrillo-Maldonado pleaded guilty under the Alford doctrine, which means she does not agree with the facts of the case, but admits theres enough evidence to convict her. She has never said exactly what happenedtoBella.

This is because staff at a branch of the chain Sonic Drive-In had walked out on their jobs and left a rather explicit note in the window revealing why. In the A message, the Ex Sonic Crew members said they refused to work for the company any longer, claiming it all came down to terrible management following the recent sale of the business. According to Now, the company went under new management on February .   But clearly staff werent impressed with their new bosses and werent afraid to tell them so, sticking the brutal letter up for all to see. It reads: Warning, due to terrible management the whole store has quit. The company has been sold to people that dont give a f*** about anyone but themselves. They apologised for any inconvenience their actions caused before explaining why they had to leave.   Our team refuses to work for a company that treats their employees like they are s*** when they have put everything into this store. We have worked too hard for too long. We are all off to better things. They added: So to the new owners, F*** YOU! Sincerely, Ex Sonic Crew. And according to reports, these staff members werent the only ones who walked out, with teams at two other Sonic Drive-In locations believed to have followed suit.   Scioto Post reports workers at the Lancaster Sonic also left a note, but it was much tamer, saying: goodbye and thank you, next. Sources close to the situation told the publication that part of the dispute was caused by pay cuts, which allegedly saw wages reduced from minimum wage to just an hour. Its currently unclear when the stores will re-open, but another branch in the area has reportedly closed for good. A Sonic spokesperson told WSYX: Under new management, guests and the community can look forward to improved service and the famous food, beverages and treats for which Sonic is known. Employees working for the local drive-in can look forward to fun, fast-paced work on which they can build a career,they choose.

The two nuclear powers are exchanging shellfire along the Line of Conflictin the much-disputed Kashmir region. Pakistan is holding an Indian pilot captive after he was shot down in an aerial engagement. The bunkers, suitable for families, are being built along Indias border with Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir state. On Tuesday evening, Pakistan used heavy calibre weapons to shell  to  places along the Indian side of the de facto border that ides Kashmir, a spokesman for the Indian defence forces said. The Indian army retaliated with its own shelling of the Pakistani side, he said.   That had created panic among people, said Rahul Yadav, the deputy commissioner of the Poonch district, a remote area of the Indian state that faced some of the attacks. The new shelters, which were planned before this weeks spike in tensions, are supposed to reduce that fear and prevent people from having to flee when the shelling begins. There have been frequent exchanges of fire along the actual and de facto borders in recent months, but Tuesdays firing marked a major escalation after India carried out an air strike on what it said was a training camp run by an Islamist militant group in Pakistan.   India was responding to a suicide car bombing claimed by a member of the group that killed  Indian paramilitary police in Kashmir almost two weeks ago. As well as the shelling, Pakistan retaliated on Wednesday by carrying out airstrikes on the Indian side of the border and, according to officials in Islamabad, shot down two Indian jets over Pakistan. India accuses Pakistan of sponsoring militancy in Kashmir, Hindu-majority Indias only Muslim-dominated region.   Tanattar Singh, -year-old man from Chachwal village, said his daughter was killed in  when she was hit by a bullet just outside their house.

Government engineers said work on the underground steel and concrete structures, which could cost a total of  million, began in June last year as relations between the nuclear-armed rivals worsened. On the Pakistani side of the border, most houses built after a ceasefire in  do not have bunkers, though the Pakistani government does have a programme to build more. In a sign of the deepening crisis, Pakistan closed its airspace until further notice. At least six airports were shuttered in India, and a vast area of airspace north of New Delhi was closed to civilian flights.

Lilibeth Bustamante asked the youngster to go with her to a shop and it was only when a neighbour stepped in to intervene as the woman grabbed the little girls arm that she was saved. The terrying incident took place in Paranaque City, the Philippines, on February .And this latest attempted abduction is one of the reasons the country is becoming known as one of the kidnapping capitals of the world.  In one year alone  people were abducted and both the US and British embassies have warned tourists travelling to the Philippines to be vigilent in light of the kidnapping threat.Bustamante was arrested after the concerned neighbour called the police and she told officers the terrying way the kidnapping gangs operate.The gangs snatch children and then sell them on the black market to become sex slaves. Bustamante, who says she was paid just pound: to carry out the abduction, claimed she worked with other women to kidnap children from the streets. She said: I only take them, they sell. They only give me one thousand pesos. I send it to my family in Mindoro.   The alleged kidnapper then claimed the gang would sell the children - both boys and girls - to foreign buyers who would often have sex with the youngsters while streaming it online anc charging people to watch. The children sell for as little as pound,. Bustamante said: We have a quota of two children per week. Our target age is -years-old and above. They require us to take good-looking children. They get , to , pesos depending on their looks. My cut is , pesos. Bustamante said that she had taken dozens of children since she joined the gang last year.  She added: We operate inManila and nearby towns. We dont stop until we reach our quota. Rudy Dimson , from the Parantildeaque Police Women and Children Protection Desk said: We are currently investigating the case. We want to look for other victims of this group. We urge the parents with missing children to come here. Several days after Bustamante was detained, police arrested a second woman after she was caught allegedly trying to abduct a young girl.\u2028 Locals surrounded her and called police who arrested her on suspicion of attempted child abduction in Batasan Hills district of Quezon City inManila.  And children are not the only victims of the kidnapping gangs. Militant groups are also targeted wealthy Filipinos as well as visitors. In June last year the New Peoples Army abducted a soldier while the militant Abu Sayyaf Groupsnatched the relatives of one of the countrys politicians. The most common place for tourists to be kidnapped is in the south of the country and travellers from China, Europe, Australia and America are the most likely targets. People are even being snatched from resorts and beaches by pirates.  Many of those abducted are ed uninjured but increasingly bold ransom and even terror demands mean some have been beheadedthese are not met. Last year  people believed to be membes of the ASG were convicted of kidnapping dozens of school pupils, teachers and a catholic priest in the militant groups worst ever abduction. Two of the teachers were beheaded and the priest also died while he was in captivity following the abduction in . Senior State Prosecutor Peter Ong said at the time: The persistence and determination of the court to give justice to the victims and those who were wrongfully arrested led to this decision, although it took more than one and a half decades to happen. In  a plot by the ASG to kidnap tourists on Bohol Island was foiled by authorities.  They hunted those responsible down in a dramatic speedboat chase and nine militants were killed along with three soldiers and once police officer. And last year a -year-old Japanese man was rescued by police after he was kidnapped in the Philippines. He was found in a house outside Manila. In  Kjartan Sekkingstad from Norway was kidnapped along with two Canadian men and a Filipina woman. This was one of the highest profile hostage for ransom cases in the country. Robert Hall was one of the three men kidnapped by the ASG. He spent nine months in captivity but was beheaded on September , .  Sekkingstad managed to escape when the Philippines military forces launched a surprise assault on the militant group responsible in the dead of night. The then -year-old fled through the jungles in the Sulu province to safety. But as he raced away from the scene of his captivity he stumbled across Canadian John Ridsdel, who he had become close to in their long months as hostages. Ridsdel was suffering from a broken rib so Sekkingstad carried him back to their captors. Just  hours later, Ridsdel, a father-of-two, was led away to be beheaded. Sekkingstad was finally freed almost a year after he was kidnapped.  The message from the embassy here in the UK is clear - there is a heightened risk of kidnapping in the Philippines. A spokesman said: There has been an increase in kidnapping of foreign nationals, including attacks targeting foreigners and tourists since late . Terrorist groups continue to plan kidnap operations against western nationals in the Philippines. However, since the ASGs leader, Isnilon Hapilon, died in October  the group has been fractured and less organised. The number of kidnappings fell last year compared to .

small travelling support expected and the top two in the ision meeting in Dingwall, tonight’s clash with Inverness Caley Thistle at Tannadice will boast the biggest turnout in the second tier.While those kind of crowds can have a positive effect on the opposition, Gordon believes the positives of being the best-supported team in the ision easily outweigh any negatives.“The fans have been

The fans are singing, they’re cheering and it just makes a massive dference for the players.“When we go back to Tannadice the noise levels there have been great. We appreciate it as a club and I know the players do.“When we play against teams they do pick up to their maximum in terms of their performance, they raise their game a little bit but it helps us in that push to pick up the points in the run-in.”Tonight, United will be without defender Freddy Frans after he had to come off with a groin injury at the weekend.He will see a specialist about the problem and, while United are hopeful he will not be out for too long, he has no chance of making tonight or Sunday, when the teamsto Tannadice to battle it out in the Scottish Cup quarter-finals.Rachid Bouhenna came on for Frans then had to go off late on with a facial injury, but could be OK.“Freddy is probably looking at a longer time out. In terms of finer detail and the number of days or weeks it’s hard to say just now,” added Gordon.“With Rachid, there was a lot of blood and a cut on the nose. You’ve got to be careful with that.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution.

A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal.

The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end.

The poems have been chosen are in a beautul book, entitled The Heart’s Time, by Janet Morley. The poems come from across the English-speaking world, over the last four centuries. One poem is set for each day, accompanied by a short explanation, a reflection, and a brief suggestion for our own thinking.Parishioners will be reading the poems at home for those who wish it there will be meetings to share thoughts and inspiration at Ardrishaig Church during the weeks of Lent and at Christ Church on Sundays. Other meetings could be arranged, formally or informally.You can order the book from Fr Simon Mackenzie by emailing dr.lachlan@zen or calling  , or directly from Argyll Book Centre.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"emergency glasgow prestwick airport cessna","story":"NewsEmergency at Glasgow Prestwick Airport as Cessna plane overshoots runway after engine failureThe incident saw a Cessna  overshoot the runway following the loss of engine power.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn emergency was declared at Prestwick Airport this afternoon after a light aircraft overshot the runway.

General manager Linda Lawson will pay tribute to  staff, who are all losing their jobs. And absolutely everything that could earn a pound was sold – including old mannequins , fashion stands and even store room shelving. The massive clear-out included giving away box loads of coat hangers. The building closes after  years of trading after current multi-millionaire owners the Jebreel family pulled the rug. As stock was snapped up in the sale, staff turned to fixtures and fittings to sell. Eight mannequins at pound each were snapped up - and some will remain gracing town windows.

The pound million screw will be positioned right on the old mill weir on the River Ayr opposite Ayrshire College. The weir originally drove an old cornmill on the site. Now tens of thousands of pounds a year will be generated by the flow of the river. Updated plans are now being considered by South Ayrshire Council, which is behind the scheme through the local Energy Agency. They show a single archimedes screw turbine at the old Nethermills Weir. Consultants Mann Power Hydro say: “Completion of this project will create a supply of renewable energy into the local distribution network, proposing firstly to sell the majority of output locally to meet the electricity demands of Ayrshire College, where the grid connection will be made. “In mitigation, the project includes a historic improvement to the passage of eels, lampreys and salmon smolts at the weir by the provision of new specialised passes for these species, and also improves upstream and downstream migration for salmon and other fish species. “It will moderate the flows into the existing passes in some conditions, which will make these less challenging. “This will help ameliorate a general problem whereby a weir is a barrier to migration of fish.” It is predicted the turbine - more than  feet in diameter and  feet long - will generate up to  kilowatts per year. The blade will turn at a maximum  revolutions per minute The Energy Agency carried out a study last year to estimate the energy potential passing over the weirs at Nethermills. It is expected the council will pocket pound, a year from selling the power and the scheme would receive a pound, feed-in-tarf. The single four-bladed screw is enough to power  homes. A report said: “With proper maintenance the scheme should continue to generate clean power for many decades after its capital cost has been repaid. “The scheme would provide an eye-catching and interesting landmark in the middle of the town, an emblem of the community’s dedication to the principle of sustainable development.

and a foot-tapping reminder of the swinging sexism of the late s.For anyone who enjoys those wonderful kitchen-sink dramas of the decade - A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or Poor Cow - this is for you.Although, in fairness, at times it feels more Sid James than Shelagh Delaney as the humour and slapstick of Carry On provide plenty of laughs.And for anyone, like myself, who doesnt already know Made in Dagenham the Musical, dont despair... the songs, like the early Ford Cortinas, are instantly adorable.Kirsty Cleland has all the allure of a young Rita Tushingham as she enchants, enthrals and entertains in the lead role.As a strike-leader and long-suffering we, the Galashiels actress is both convincing and commanding.And the ever-reliable Stuart Mitchell, who plays hard-done-by husband Eddie, has to be at the top of his game not to be outshone.But, in true socialist fashion, Made in Dagenham the Musical isnt just about the leads... everyone has their part to play - and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"letter support the raf benevolent fund","story":"Last month’s vandalism at the Bomber Command memorial highlighted the very worst and the very best of our communities.I cannot thank your readers enough for their incredible support in the wake of this shocking paint attack.To date we have received more than £, in donations to help the RAF Benevolent Fund meet the repair bill.Repair works have now been completed on the memorial and it is now ed to its former glory.As well as the donations received, the RAF Benevolent Fund had thousands of messages of support from around the world.It was heart-warming to see the regard in which the memorial, the veterans and the , men it stands to represent are held.We must never forget their sacrices and the RAF Benevolent Fund is proud to beof this tribute to their legacy, for generations to come.As the Fund enters its th year of support for the RAF family, we must not forget those veterans who are still with us.Our aim this year is to ask for the public’s help in reaching more of these veterans and their families, while we still can.Our support could help pay for the care costs of an RAF widow, or provide for mobility aids to keep an elderly veteran at home, or simply allow a veteran to enjoy his retirement in dignity and comfort, through a regular financial grant.Put simply, the RAF Benevolent Fund looks after the RAF family.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Last chance for Mundell to put country before party","story":"The majority of these demands are perfunctory, of course, made in the knowledge and expectation that they will be ignored by the target, while playing well with the initiatorrsquos supporters.The craziness of the last few months has precipitated a flurry of genuine and warranted resignation demands, however, which under normal political circumstances would have resulted in multiple ministerial heads rolling in any other era the Prime Minister would have been forced out long ago.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysAnother case in point is Scottish Secretary David Mundell, whose stubborn insistence on being ineffectual in the face of the biggest crisis this country has faced in generations is matched only by that of Jeremy Corbyn.

If Mrs May gets her way and Parliament is faced with a last-minute binary choice between her terrible deal - which deprives us of the key benefits being in the EU - and an even more catastrophic no-deal, it leaves the party in a dficult position. How should Nicola Sturgeon instruct her MPs to vote in this scenario  Backing Mrs Mayrsquos ldquomy way or the highway deal would be criticised by many as a U-turn of epic proportions and a sign of weakness. Not voting for it, and thus facilitating a no-deal Brexit, would likely be viewed by many voters as unforgivable, leaving the party open to allegations that this is the outcome it has been secretly hoping for all along, in order to boost support for independence.Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues will be hoping the growing number of Tory ministers and backbench MPs ndash including Cabinet secretaries Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke - poised to revolt against their leader should she refuse to rule out a no-deal Brexit, will come to their rescue in the frantic days and weeks to come.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysThe emergence of the The Independent Groupmay also end up helping the SNPrsquos predicament, at least in the short term. Formed last week when eight MPs resigned from Labour unhappy at Mr Corbynrsquos disastrous leadership, it did not initially appear to be an important development. But when three Tory MPs also resigned and joined up, using the moment to launch a blistering attack on Mrs Mayrsquos disastrous Brexit strategy and their partyrsquos lurch to the right, it started to feel more signicant.What binds these MPs from dferent sides of the House of Commons is dismay at the drt of both parties to the extremities.

With Scotlands  local authorities under pressure to save every penny there have been new concerns that councils, which are not legally required to provide toilets, are increasingly looking to offload the responsibility for them or close them to cut costs.Last month, a Herald study found that as of September, one in three of Scotlandrsquos remaining public toilets face being sold off or closed as councils battle to balance the books, sparking calls for them to become a human right.Now Aberdeen is currently considering shutting all ten of its public conveniences to save pound, and Highland, another tourism-leaning area, has  of its  public toilets, the most in Scotland, but have cut  in the past five years, and have five more facing the possible axe with a further  under scrutiny with plans for either partnerships or estment.In Moray, councillors and tourist chiefs have come up with a novel way to save their public toilets from the axe.An amendment supported by councillors yesterday suggests that the the toilets should remain open and under the control of the council for another year as discussions take place over whether to turn them into tourism hotspots, providing visitors with wi-fi and screens offering local information.Speyside Glenlivet councillor Derek Ross said the stay of execution will allow for a plan to be put in place to work out how the toilets can be used, and who will own them in the future.\"I am pleased the councillors accepted the amendment, sotoilets are safe for the time being.One of the jewels in the Moray crown: Cullen\"I wanted to have them kept open go give communities time to put in place initiatives to keep the toilets open, to consult with them and look at a iety of funding sources.\"We are keeping them open for another year.

Whatever they have spent the money on, it is not the set. With its purple chairs and faux art it looked like the business class lounge of a cheapo airline.

The next questions, on sectarianism and a possible teachersrsquo pay strike, were not matters that would have been raised on a QT from London, so in that respect Debate Night showed its worth, evennothing new emerged in the discussion.I would like to say the hour was packed with penetrating questions and illuminating answers, a show that showed QT how such programmes should be done. There were one or two moments worth catching, most of them coming from plain-speaking Sir Tom Hunter, but by and large this was a punishing watch, not least because of the late slot. An .pm finish, on a school night  Why bother committing to a serious programmeit doesnrsquot have a credible chance of building an audience By the time Jardine said goodnight it was time for this Cinderella to head to bed.

The Orkney MSP has today, Tuesday, urged the Scottish Government to #pay heed to the realities of fuel poverty.#The figures, published by the Scottish Government, showed that the fuel poverty rate in Orkney was  per cent — compared to  per cent in the City of Edinburgh.“Fuel poverty levels are shameful Scotland-wide in this day and age,# said Mr McArthur.#However, these figures underline that rural and island communities are disproportionately badly affected.“I have consistently made the case for recognition of this alarming disparity, and I am glad that the Housing Minister has now agreed to look at options to recognise that ahead of Stage Two of the Fuel Poverty Bill.“Orkney and other rural and island communities urgently need targeted action to reduce the astronomical rates of fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty. The latest figures provide a timely reminder about the need to get the legislation and policy right.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power. It is time for a rethink.\"Calum Macaulay, chief executive of Invergordon-based Albyn Housing Society, said: ldquoWe welcome this development in the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to addressing fuel poverty in rural areas. The push to include minimum income standards feels like a signicant step forwards. This is something that the Rural and Islands Housing Association Forum has been promoting for quite some time.\"This has included research undertaken with the support of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others into minimum income standards in rural communities. The results of this highlighted the pressures of lower average household incomes and higher average fuel costs across the northern parts of Scotland.\"What do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupThursday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If the facility is not taken on by the community then it will close on March as per report to the Highland Council [on] October .ldquoNo survey will be undertaken, the facility will transfer in lsquoas seen, as isrsquo condition, the facilities will transfer in their current operational condition. The position of toilets remaining open whilst negotiations are ongoing is for this financial year only. There is no budget to retain facilities... which is why we want to get the leases sorted out before the end of March.Despite that the director of the Groam House Museum Doug Maclean, who recently attended a meeting of the community council where the future of the toilets was on the agenda remains hopeful.ldquoWe are confident that by some means or other, through a charitable trust taking over the running of the toilets and the good services of the local people, we will be able to keep the toilets open, he said.However, Mr Maclean was in no doubt about how serious an effect the closure would have on Rosemarkie as well as Groam House Museum.ldquoFrom the museumrsquos point of view it is absolutely vital for our existence. We have groups of school children that come here and of course children need to go to the toilet, he said.ldquoWe also have groups of mainly elderly American tourists and they are not in a position to make their way to the beach cafeacute. And we would lose both those groups without the toilets which put the museum in jeopardy.Black Isle ward councillor Gordon Adam said: ldquoI am in discussions with the council over the time limit of March , my view is that the council needs to be flexible.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction. Our work complements the work done by NHS Drug and Alcohol Recovery staff.ldquoWe would like to thank all those people for their extremely valuable contributions which made it possible for us to serve our community for over  years.Councillor Margaret Paterson, Dingwall and Seaforth, said: ldquoI know this group and this will be a dreadful loss as they give a tremendous service. It is quite distressing to hear this because they have given people with addiction and their families such help for so many years. Their volunteers have given such time and talent to help the vulnerable in society, butthey donrsquot have money then they just canrsquot do it. I hope that something can be done to continue their good work.Two service users who wished to remain anonymous praised ACSRS for the help they received.

It’s harder to do things by halves, in a way... You’re not fully invested, so you get bogged down by the self-doubt and not knowing why you’re doing it and what choices you’re making.”He continues: “I wanted to have an authentic experience, but that meant shooting in Malawi was going to be really important. Andshooting in Malawi was going to be really important, then it felt like shooting it in a Malawian language was going to be very important.“Trying to find the right people to play the parts, and people and actors who are going to be engaged with all the complications of Chichewa and doing it in that way, felt a natural part of the process.”Ejiofor has worked with some incredibly successful directors throughout his career – Steve McQueen for  Years A Slave, Alfonso Cuaron for Children of Men, Stephen Frears for what was arguably his breakout role, in thriller Dirty Pretty Things, and, as mentioned earlier, Spielberg right at the start of his career.But while they have all been “deeply inspirational”, he stresses there must be a balance on set of trying to find your own voice with a film too.“If you are trying to borrow somebody , then the film is going to feel like you’re trying to borrow somebody ,” he elaborates.“In the end it is about trying to be honest, and to be honest to yourself and whatever \u2028your strengths are but also to what your weaknesses are, and to ‘fess up to them and \u2028try and navigate them, because all of it is very raw on screen.“It’s a very transparent medium and it really does expose the director, it exposes the writer, it exposes the actor. It’s very brutal as a format. So, you’ve just got to be as truthful to yourself as you can be.”The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind is available on Netflix from tomorrow©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"call for overall junk food advert watershed in scotland","story":"All junk food advertising for children should be banned in a bid to combat childhood obesity, health experts have warned.A pm watershed on junk food adverts should be implemented across all media devices and channels to protect children from the harmful effects of marketing of foods high in fat, sugar and salt, according to a report compiled by a -strong group of charities and health campaigners including Obesity Action Scotland and TV chef Jamie Oliver.The group said this pm watershed should include live TV, TV on demand, radio, all types of online, social media, apps, in-game, cinema and digital outdoor advertising.Current rules, introduced for TV in  and online in , only restrict junk food adverts when a TV show, film or website is designed specically for children or considered to be “of particular appeal” to them. They do not cover the times when children are likely to be watching “family” shows such as the X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent, which generally screen between pm and pm.Lorraine Tulloch, programme lead of Obesity Action Scotland, said: “We know that junk food adverts influence what children eat and contribute to childhood obesity.The current restrictions don’t cover family viewing time or popular Saturday night TV viewing. “We need to ensure they are protected from junk food adverts on all forms of media. It’s time for government to step up and take action to protect the health of our children.”The group carried out a poll which found that  per cent of people agree that children seeing junk food marketing contributes to childhood obesity, while around  per cent support a pm watershed.Malcolm Clark, policy manager at Cancer Research UK, said: “Young children who spent more than half an hour a day online, where advertising can be prolic, were almost twice as likely to pester their parents for junk food, according to a recent Cancer Research UK report. There is strong evidence that suggests time spent online and watching TV increases the likelihood that children will ask for, buy and eat more unhealthy foods. If they didn’t, then the food industry wouldn’t spend so much on advertising.”Caroline Cerny of the Obesity Health Alliance said: “A pm watershed across all types of junk advertising is the most effective measure to protect children from the harms of junk food advertising.”The Scottish Government is currently exploring action on devolved aspects of advertising, while the UK government has promised a consultation on advertising restrictions.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish children reading books which are too easy","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scottish pupils have the joint greatest level of reading comprehension, alongside Northern Ireland, the largest literacy study ever conducted among home nations reveals.However, despite primary and secondary pupils north of the border, having the highest comprehension levels, on average they, like other home nation pupils, are reading the least dficult books.

Jeff Kinney’s Diary of a Wimpy Kid series and David Walliams’ Gangsta Granny and Billionaire Boy were amongst the most-read authors for both primary and secondary pupils.Professor Topping described the results as “eye-opening.” “It’s great to see that Scottish pupils are at the top of the table in reading comprehension. “We can now see that balancing the three factors of appropriate reading challenge, reading practice, and reading motivation is fundamental for children’s reading progress.“Although important,instilling reading culture in schools isn’t just about dedicated reading time.“Teachers and librarians should also encourage lively classroom discussion about fiction, with children sharing favourite authors and titles. “They should also be on hand to advise on books with appropriate challenge bespoke to the child’s interests. And of course, it is important to encourage children to read outside of school, so letting them take books home is crucial.”A spokeswoman for the Educational Institute of Scotland, said: “Literacy and numeracy are key elements of Curriculum for Excellence, and are firmly embedded in all areas of learning and teaching in Scotland’s schools. “Pupils receive inidual support from teachers at all stages to encourage their reading and this, coupled with access to school libraries to help encourage additional independent reading, helps to ensure that young people can develop their reading at an appropriate pace for them.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"wildcats no longer viable in the wild after 7 000 years","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotland#s iconic native wildcat is doomed to extinction in the wild and will not survive without major conservation action, according to international experts.The report, by cat specialists from the International Union for Conservation of Nature, reviews all evidence collected and concludes there is no longer a viable wildcat population living wild in Scotland.It suggests captive breeding and reintroductions could be the only way to guarantee the species will continue to exist in Scotland, where it has been present since the last ice age.Dubbed the Highland tiger, the wildcat is one of the UK’s most endangered mammals. Cross-breeding with pet and feral cats has been cited as the key threat to their natural survival. It is thought hybridisation began to affect the species severely between the s and s, driven by decreasing food sources, road kill and persecution by humans.Scottish Wildcat Action , a national conservation scheme, was set up in  in a last-ditch bid to rescue the species from the brink.However, it’s now thought previous estimates of the number of pure-bred wildcats remaining in the wild were way too high.Dr Andrew Kitchener, principal curator of vertebrates at National Museums Scotland and chair of the SWA steering group, said: “We now have the strongest and most reliable evidence to date that wildcats are in a more endangered state than previously understood. “While we believe there are wildcats remaining in the wild in Scotland, there are no longer enough to ensure their continued survival as viable populations. “We can now plan the essential next steps to give the wildcat a sustainable future.”Environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham has said no stone will be left unturned in the quest to save the nation’s only native feline.“The wildcat is an iconic Scottish species and as such I will consider every possible action the Scottish Government can take to save it, including an increased focus on captive breeding and reinforcement of the Scottish population with wildcats from where,” she said. “We have in place a partnership of scientists and specialists with the knowledge and expertise to give us the best chance of restoring the Highland Tiger as a distinctive and charismatic species in the Scottish countryside.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit sacked scottish mp says eu citizens used as bargaining chip","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...An MP sacked as parliamentary aide to the Scottish Secretary accused the UK Government of using EU citizens in the UK as a #bargaining chip# over the past two and a half years.Alberto Costa was forced as Parliamentary Private Secretaryto David Mundell after lodging an amendment calling for the UK to seek agreement with Brussels on citizens rights even in a no-deal - even though his proposal was accepted by ministers.Addressing MPs after losing his job in government, Mr Costa said it was a “very sad state of affairs” that his amendment was needed, and said the rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons living in the EU “should never have been used as a bargaining chip”.The amendment passed without a vote last night, with the government avoiding likely defeat after more than  MPs from all parties said they backed it.Born in Scotland to Italian parents who have lived in the UK for decades without claiming British citizenship, Mr Costa has sought firm guarantees for EU citizens in all Brexit outcomes since the referendum in . He was knighted by the Italian government in  for his campaigning on behalf of European citizens.The Prime Minister’s spokespeople said Mr Costa had resigned after breaking the convention that members of the government do not put down amendments to government business.However, one government source said the South Leicestershire MP had been called in to the whips’ office shortly before quitting. Another source confirmed that Mr Costa had been “sacked”.It sparked anger in the Scotland Office and many Tory MPs, with whom Mr Costa is a popular figure. One source at Dover House said Mr Costa was a “huge asset” to Mr Mundell’s department and described his exit as a “loss”, while another was quoted as saying his treatment had been “appalling”.In a post on social media, the Scottish Secretary said he was “very sorry” to lose Mr Costa has his PPS. At Holyrood, the Tory finance spokesman Murdo Fraser called the sacking “hard to understand” and said Mr Costa “should be rewarded not punished”.Mr Costa met with Theresa May following his resignation, and her spokespeople stressed the Prime Minister’s “deep admiration” for his work.There had been confusion earlier in the day when Home Secretary Sajid Javid told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that he saw “nothing” wrong with the amendment, only for SNP MP Stuart McDonald to point out the Prime Minister had suggested it was legally unworkable the day before.Mr Costa told the Commons that citizens’ rights “should never have been used as a bargaining chip during the negotiations for our withdrawal from the EU. That such rights were placed on the table in the first place was wrong.” Rights should have been ‘ring fenced’ in negotiations “at the outset”, Mr Costa added.Mr McDonald said it was “shameful, and deeply ironic, that the first time someone in the Scotland Office actually does their job... they are swtly given the sack”.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit macron and merkel say delay must be justified","story":"France#s President Emmanuel Macron has said the UK needs a good reason to seek a delay of its scheduled  March departure from the EU.Speaking in a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Paris yesterday, Mr Macron reiterated that the withdrawal agreement “cannot be renegotiated”.Any delay request would need to be justied by “a clear perspective on the goal”, he said.“We don’t need time, we need decisions.”Mrs Merkel said that Germany and France “agree completely” that the already-negotiated withdrawal agreement stands.“If Britain needs a bit more time, we will not refuse that, but we are aiming for an orderly solution, an orderly withdrawal by the British from the European Union,” she said.Asked about Mr Macron’s remarks, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “It’s clear what the Prime Minister is trying to achieve which is to secure further assurance in relation to the backstop not being indefinite.

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year. Her performances have also caught the eye of the Celtic women#s team and she was recently invited to join the club#s national performance squad for a year#s trial. last week. #I can fly down and be in Glasgow on a Friday and fly back to be in school on Monday morning. It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football. I just want to keep going to a higher level, and get more caps # that#s my ultimate goal.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/PORTREE-BRAES-TRUST-FIONA-AND-SOPHIE-2.jpg","title":"nae pasaranwhen scottish workers stood against a fascist","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere can#t be many pensioners from East Kilbride who are Commanders of the Republic of Chile. It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award.

A similar structure linking Denmark and Sweden will be used as a guide when investigating the logistics of the bridge.Ian Paisley welcomed the positive discussions.He said: “This move from a Red Light to an Amber Light shows progress and is encouraging for a future Green Light on the bridge project.”Speaking to the , Mr Paisley added: “This is a matter I have raised at our select committee and now the transport secretary is taking this forward to find a way of supporting a feasibility study. “That would be a signicant move and would be most welcome.“Obviously this is at an early stage but it wouldn’t take a blind man on a galloping horse to miss the opportunities for employment commerce and tourism!“Any feasibility study would have to look at where the bridge would leave NI and enter the mainland all of that will now need to be considered.“As a unionist it’s very obvious to see the added attraction of linking our kingdom in this physical way.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460409.jpg--.jpg?1550570234000\n","title":"children from gran canaria welcomed to ballymena","story":"A group of children from Gran Canaria have been visiting Ballymena to take part in the annual local music festival.The group of  children are pupils of the British School of Gran Canaria, and are taught by local woman Claire McDonald.Claire, who is the head of the music department at the English speaking school has accompanied her pupils to Northern Ireland to take part in the festival, sightsee, improve their English skills and experience the culture of Northern Ireland.The young people, who are all aged between  and  years old are keen musicians, with some playing the piano, drums, violins while others are singers.They have experienced success at the festival, with some winning first and second prizes and others were highly commended.The group have been travelling around NI, visiting the Giant’s Causeway, Hillsborough Castle and the Titanic museum and performed in a local concert with Kellswater Flute Band.This has been their first taste of Northern Ireland, and it did not disappoint!One of the students, Miguel said: “I’ve really enjoyed my trip. “I play the drums and the musical festival has been great.“We learn English at school so it’s good to speak it here.”Fellow student Alicia, said: “Northern Ireland is great and the festival has been a wonderful experience.“I was really excited to play with the band but my favourite part was the Giant’s Causeway and the music festival.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460481.jpg--.jpg?1550570359000\n","title":"rodney quigley announces independent candidacy","story":"Ballymena man Rodney Quigley has announced he plans to stand in this year’s Council elections.Announcing his candidacy on Facebook this week, the well known community activist posted: “I intend to stand as an Independent candidate in the Mid and East Antrim council elections on nd May.“As someone who has worked tirelessly as a community worker for over  years, and as a member of the policing and community safety partnership for  years, I feel that I have something to offer at local council level.“I have dealt with many community issues in the past and will continue to put the community first on any issues that are brought to my attention. “Ive also worked with many councillors on many issues in the past and would continue to work along side them for the good of everyone in Ballymena.“I know that many people have said its time for change and it would be good to see a few new faces within Mid and East Antrim council.“If this is the case Id like to be one of the new faces.“I can assure people thatelected, I will put my best foot forward every time and will work to resolve local issues for everyone in Ballymena.”Election datesNomination forms for prospective candidates must be ed to the Deputy Returning Officer by pm on Monday April , .The election will be held on Thursday, May , .

It is expected to be complete in five weeks.This will improve road safety along this extremely busy stretch of the A and is welcome news for the , drivers who use the road each day.In advance of the main A junctions improvement scheme, the Department has already closed up a number of gaps in the central reservation and installed central reserve safety barrier at three locations between Hillsborough and Loughbrickland over the last two years, totalling approximately five kilometres.The temporary traffic management required to carry out the works safely will consist of speed restrictions and lane closures adjacent to the central median in both the northbound and southbound carriageways. To minimise disruption to motorists, the lane closures are scheduled for overnight, between pm and am every night including weekends from March  until April  . The speed restrictions will apply at all times for the safety of road users ‎until works are fully completed.The Department has programmed the work and traffic management arrangements to minimise any inconvenience, however, drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Completion of the work by  April  is dependent on favourable weather conditions, however, the Department will keep the public informed of any change.For traffic information about this and other improvement schemes visit: www.trafficwatchni\"  \"  Ireland, Lions and Ulster Rugby legend Willie John McBride honoured by the QueenUrinated on the shelves at Tesco and struck security guard on eye Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"lockhart supports special olympics coffee morning","story":"DUP Upper Bann Assembly member Carla Lockhart has added her support to the Banbridge Special Olympics Club along side MP David Simpson, Cllr Paul Greenfield and Cllr Junior McCrum.

Joseph Carson, The Bard of Kilpike, was one of the characters mentioned.I was fascinated and filled with curiosity. Green space at Kilpike, now known as Seapatrick.Where was Kilpike  What does the name mean  I know ‘kil’ means old church, but what about ‘pike’ I couldn’t wait to get home to look up my dictionaries of Irish place names. Alister said he thought Kilpike was an old term for Seapatrick. I found that to be true. The name makes sense as it is site of an ancient church and other place names in the area, such as Kilowen , confirm that. The River Bann runs behind the church, but ‘pike’  That was more dficult. I only found one reference, namely ‘pice’, Irish for ‘pike’. My knowledgeable friend, Johnny Dooher,confused the issue by saying pice is Irish for hayfork then askedthere are, or were, any pike in the river  He wonderedthe original name had been Anglicised  If anybody has any knowledge about the origin of the name ‘Kilpike’, and its exact boundaries I’d be grateful to be enlightened.According to friends who have lived in Banbridge all their lives Kilpike has changed to Seapatrick within living memory.  Names do change over time. Banbridge was once called Ballyvally. In  a bridge was built over the River Bann hence the name. Why did Kilpike change  Does anybody know Now, what about the bard himself  The Bard of Kilpike was a weaver called Joseph Carson. He was born in Lurgan before moving to Banbridge where he lived, worked and wrote. He published a book, ‘Poems, Songs and Satires’ in , which contains many references to Banbridge and the people living there at the time. Joseph poems are in the Ulster Scots dialect so he belongs to the group known as the ‘weaving poets’. There was no compulsory National System of Education until , that is until after his book was published. He said he lacked a decent education because he was never went to school once he reached the age of  years, with the exception of five weeks when he attended a school in Banbridge. By this time he was married. Weaving was not properly industrialised in the early s being mainly a cottage industry. I imagined Joseph sitting at his loom in his cottage, weaving away and making up poems to the rhythm of his shuttlecock. Did he learn them off by heart  Could he read and write  Or did somebody  write them down for him  ObviouslyI needed to do some research and a visit to the Irish Library in Armagh was required so away I went.Royal Visit round-up: The Duke  Duchess of Cambridge in Northern Ireland Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Armagh’s Irish Library is a pleasant place. I prefer it to The Public Record Office because although there is a smaller collection the staff are so helpful. It was once an old hospital and has an atmosphere which feels steeped in local history. lt also has an extensive free car park. I had an interesting morning and this is what I found.Until the Act of Catholic Emancipation of  it was illegal to be educated unless you belonged to the Anglican Church. . Children and teachers willing to risk indulging in educational pursuits hid in the remote areas, among rocks, behind hedges and so on, these schools becoming known as Hedge Schools. Punishments were severeyou were caught so lookouts were employed to warn the class of approaching danger. Originally the Hedge Schools had very good reputations which were lost over the passage of time. Some existed long after the Act of Catholic Emancipation until well into the ‘s, by which time they had become dissolute institutions with unruly pupils and teachers who could be drunk and riotous. Churches had Sunday schools and there were a few organisations such as ‘The Society for the Discountenancing of Vice and Promoting the Knowledge and Practice of Religion and Virtue’, The Kildare Place Society and the Lancasterian Schools which aimed to educate people and possiblymake them virtuous as well!There were also some iniduals who ran schools. There weren’t any suitable text books. Children were taught to read using the Bible, or whatever other material their tutors had, such as ‘The Le and Works of Moll Flanders’ although some official educational establishments, such as The Kildare Place Society’, did publish children’s books. The language in these books is so dficult I found dficulty in reading and understanding them.According to Captain Richard Linn a ‘superior school’ was established in Banbridge by Mr. James Withers in the late s. The Rev. James Davis M.A. conducted a ‘Classical Academy’ during most of the time he was the incumbent of Bannside Presbyterian Church. . A Lancasterian School was set up on th October  in the upper storey of the Old Market House, prior to building a new school, in Church Street, which opened in . The building still exists. It has been turned into apartments in Lancaster Court.  Joseph Carson said he had every reason to revere a local woman, Mrs Alexander McCaw, of Greenhill near Banbridge. She got books for him, taught him to read, corrected his pronounciation and explained the meaning of words he didn’t know. He said he ‘practised every evening, for a winter season, after the labours of the day were over.’ The result is he is he produced a creditable amount of work and is remembered as The Bard of Kilpike. Fascinating! I’d love to know more about him."},{"url":null,"title":"urinated on the shelves at tesco and struck security guard on eye","story":"A -year-old man who urinated on the shelves in Tesco in Lurgan was given suspended prison sentences last Wednesday at Craigavon Magistrates Court.Richard Chestnut, whose address was given as St John’s Terrace, Moira, pleaded guilty to criminal damage, the theft of a bottle of wine and common assault on October  last year.Tesco has announced plans to cut , jobs.The court heard that at .pm police were called to Tesco in Millennium Way after a report of a security guard having been assaulted.When Chestnut entered the store he was unsteady on his feet and on CCTV he was seen to urinate on shelves before lting a bottle of wine and a bottle of coke.As he tried to leave he was restrained by the security guard who removed the bottle of wine from him.The defendant then shouted: “You shower of f—king b—ds. Do you know who I am  I’m Richard Chestnut and I know who you are.”He struck the security guard on the right eye.Defence barrister Seamus Lannon said his client was short of funds but had £ with him in court, although he had indicated to him that his might not ‘cut the mustard’.District Judge, Mrs Bernie Kelly, said Chestnut had been aware of this since November andsomeone turned up at court with the money in their pocket this was a demonstrable sign of remorse.Mr Lannon said that in the pre-sentence report his client did present himself as remorseful.He added that Chestnut had found a job involving double glazing and would be prepared to repay the money.Judge Kelly said the defendant was urinating on shelves in Tesco at seven in the evening when children, parents and grandparents could have been present.“It was a reprehensible act,” she added.£, A Dromore road schemeLast call for entries as Northern Ireland Tourism Awards head to Armagh for  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The judge said there was CCTV coverage and Chestnut says ‘do you know who I am’ because of the amount of alcohol he had he had a lapse of memory and didn’t know who he was.Mr Lannon said the defendant accepted he ‘behaved irresponsibility’ but was attempting to draw a line under this and make good to society.“I doubt that, not with his record and his attitude,” said Judge Kelly.She added Chestnut could not distinguish between a toilet and a set of shelves.“There could have been some wee cratur lting what they needed and he didn’t care. He was completely oblivious. You don’t go to a supermarket to watch other people use it as a toilet.

They visited a mix of work-based credit unions and community credit unions to provide much-needed technical assistance, especially in rural districts of the Bwiam region.The technical assistance provided by Rosaleen and the coaches included providing support to Gambian credit union staff on day-to-day operations, loan management and credit control.Following each credit union visit Rosaleen and Michael had the opportunity to meet with their Boards and put forward recommendations on how to further develop their credit union .Rosaleen and the coaches also organised for a meeting with local taxi drivers to discuss the potential of them setting up their own credit union.At the end of the visits the coaches hosted a two-day workshop for credit union personnel in Banjul. This allowed for the coaches to discuss credit union issues and share their knowledge with the participants.Rosaleen presented on the topic of governance to the participants.Throughout the two weeks Rosaleen and her fellow volunteers were able to share their skills and knowledge to build the capacity of the credit union personnel in The Gambia and empower them to further strengthen their movement.Rosaleen also had the opportunity to meet credit union members and hear about how the credit union is making a real dference in their lives.The Irish credit union movement is highly regarded across the world and the visit by the Irish coaches was hugely appreciated by the credit union movement in The Gambia.Speaking about her visit, Rosaleen said: “I would like to take the opportunity to thank the members of Newington Credit Union who have supported the ILCU Foundation for many years.“To be able to visit one of the countries which benefit from our support and come back and share my experience enables me to highlight the needs of small rural communities who live in abject poverty.“In facing such conditions the people remain cheerful and are always smiling – hence the name given to The Gambia: the Smiling Coast of Africa. The Gambian credit union volunteers and staff are so keen to enhance their knowledge and skills to develop their credit unions and I hope in the coming years they go from strength to strength.“I would like to thank my fellow coaches, the ILCU Foundation and NACCUG who helped make the trip so successful. ”Baboucarr Jeng, General Manager NACCUG, expressed his thanks to Rosaleen and the coaches for giving their time to help the credit unions in The Gambia and he emphasised the need for the participants “to use the education from the training to develop their skills and the credit unions they represent”.Alan Moore, CEO ILCU Foundation, added: “It has been great to have Rosaleen on board for our coaching programme for the past two years, she has been a fantastic ambassador for the ILCU Foundation and indeed the wider Irish credit union movement.“Throughout the course of her time in The Gambia, our partner credit unions have learnt a great deal from Rosaleen and her fellow coaches.“We are very grateful to Rosaleen for giving up her time to volunteer to help our partners, who, like Rosaleen, know the value of having a credit union and what it means for the members.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Newington Credit Union who supported Rosaleen to participate in the Coaching Programme and for their continued support to the ILCU Foundation’s work.”Newington Credit Union.- Duncairn Gardens,Belfast,BT GF.Tel:   "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"lagmore bus service has been partially reinstated","story":"A vital bus service that was pulled from the Colin area last Tuesday night – due to a spate of anti-social behaviour and attacks on Translink drivers – was reinstated last night.The Andersonstown News reported last week how Sinn Féin Councillor Danny Baker was “fighting” to save the much needed d feeder service to Mount Eagles after it was taken off around pm last Tuesday night after five youths smashed a rear window of a bus inspector’s car and tried to pull at the doors of passing buses.

He was placed on remand in Crumlin Road Gaol where he admits he was looking forward to some rest after years of struggle, but he didn’t know what to expect.His imprisonment coincided with the building of the H-Blocks, where the first blanket man, Kieran Nugent, had begun his protest against criminalisation just three months earlier. At that time, however, Seamus said, “Nobody knew what way the jails were going.” Indeed, during an early encounter with Kieran Doherty, who would die on hunger strike in , he was informed that his comrades were “disappearing off the face of the earth” after sentence. After his own sentencing, Seamus was moved from the Crumlin Road to H-Block  in June . It was there that he first met future hunger strikers Kevin Lynch, Thomas McElwee and the then block OC, Bobby Sands. During their short time in H, which was then used as a transitional block, Seamus and his comrades resolved to join the blanket protest. Non-conformity meant being locked in a cell for  hours a day and a ‘Number ’ starvation diet.“After refusing a unorm you were told to strip ‘everything’,” he said. “It was all men looking at you, so it was a bit weird. They put the clothes into a brown bag and I remember thinking to myself ‘I’m going to get them back.’“It seemed quite daunting because I thought I was getting some R and R,” he added.“We ended up in H and took each day as it came. One day led to another. Your legs start getting tingly from the lack of exercise, but the idea was to keep walking to keep moving. “After a few months, we were lucky, because at the end of January  Brendan Hughes, ‘The Dark’, arrived. I ended up in cell next to him. Bobby ended up at the far wing of H. Getting Brendan Hughes was amazing. He was already a hero, even then.”According to Seamus, the arrival of Brendan Hughes, who took up command in the blocks, was pivotal in the escalation of the prison protests. The blanket men were isolated from the outside world and the British government was “winning the propaganda war”, but with the men voting in favour of Brendan Hughes’ idea of no-wash protest in February , the protest began gaining public attention.“We needed to recalibrate,” Seamus said.“It was then that we were told that this was not a local jail dispute. This was a part of governmental policy and that it was bigger than we thought. I think the Brits thought we weren’t of the same calibre of Connolly or Pearse – that we would do what we were told. But they were wrong. They were hitting a raw nerve and they didn’t realise it, and maybe we didn’t. We weren’t thinking about what it all meant, but our backs were against the wall.”Seamus continued: “It was about attracting national international interest. We had to open new lines of communication to the outside world and get our story out there, because at that time they were winning the propaganda war.“We were already getting harassed on the way out of our cells, so The Dark said we were going to exploit that going into the no-wash protest. The screws were already beating some of the lads. You were going out one cell at a time and it was one man being hit by about  screws.”Seamus was soon moved to H where he lost Brendan Hughes’ counsel, but said he and his comrades were emboldened at the onset of the no-wash protest. Their ingenuity in sending communications within the blocks and to the outside world is now legendary. It was during that time, amid increasing brutality from the screws, that the prisoners took the decision to smear excrement on walls – a decision that Seamus said was taken reluctantly.“We didn’t know how we would even do it – the mechanics of it,” he said.“We were improvising again. Some bright spark, Tom Martin, had the idea of taking a piece of the mattress and using it as a sponge. That seemed to be the only way to do it. Eventually we did it together. We started smearing it on the wall – it was horrible. After about two weeks the screws went ballistic. I remember the screw opening the cell door and saying ‘you dirty bastards – you fucking animals.’ I think that’s when the real hatred started forming. We didn’t feel good about putting it up anyway. We weren’t animals, but we felt that we had to do it to highlight the case.”Seamus recalls  as bad year for the blanket men, particularly in ‘an seachtain dona’of April that year, when “people were literally beaten off the blanket”. He said the remaining blanket men were determined to “save the IRA from obliteration” and, often, it was comedy that got them through. While you were getting beaten you were still laughing,” he recalled. Seamus tells with a smile of a visit from an old neighbour who cajoled him into singing ‘Smoke Gets in Your Eyes’ by Bryan Ferry – a move that brought applause from the visiting room and, later, a beating from the screws. Needless to say, she never visited again.While the torture endured by the blanket men was immense, Seamus faced one of his toughest challenges when he received word that the IRA had executed his brother, Michael Kearney, as an informer in July . The screws initially mocked his brother’s death, but later offered supposed salvation and a chance to leave the blanket. Michael’s name would not be cleared until  when it was revealed that he had been killed at the behest of IRA informant Freddie Scappaticci, codename Stakekne. However, Seamus remained undaunting in his commitment to the IRA during his  years in prison. “I gave him my blessing to join the IRA,” he said.“I felt he betrayed me and he betrayed Ireland. I didn’t know what I was going to do. Everything stood still.“I was in the middle of no-man’s land. I was neither with the IRA or the British and I felt shell-shocked. The first thing that went through my mind was ‘What am I going to tell the lads ’“It was the first time I realised the distinction between mind and body, which you’ll not understand until it happens,” he added.“My body was telling me I’d had enough – I was starving, I had lice, I had dysentery – but my mind was saying, ‘Tell themto fuck off.’ “I told them I had lots of brothers. There were  of them, one of them was dead, but I had Sean on the outside and I had brothers in the H-Blocks.“I told the lads that the only way they would take me out isthey carried me out. They weren’t going to break the back of the IRA.”The H-Blocks saw a hunger strike in  that saw the British government renege on a deal it had struck with the prisoners. Tragically,  men – Bobby Sands, Francis Hughes, Raymond McCreesh, Patsy O’Hara, Joe McDonnell, Martin Hurson, Kevin Lynch, Kieran Doherty, Thomas McElwee and Michael Devine – died on hunger strike the following year. Of the  that died, Seamus knew six of them personally, and he vividly recalls the last time he saw Bobby Sands during Mass in February .“At the end of the Mass Bobby went round the lads clockwise,” he said.“He came to me and smiled and said ‘I see you’re still here,’ and I knew it was in relation to our Michael. I said ‘There’s nowhere  to go, Bobby.’ He looked straight into my eyes and said ‘Good man – goodbye.’“I had doubted him. Most of our wing had doubted him. To me he was just like a Rod Stewart lookalike. I had given him the words to ‘This Old Heart of Mine’ before – he liked that song. When I looked into his eyes that Sunday they were like a shark’s eyes. He had resigned himself and I knew he was going to go through with.“The hunger strike was a formality. Bobby didn’t really die on May the th – he died in February. One after another they died and it was like losing a part of yourself. It was the same reaction I had to losing our Michael. It was like losing brothers. It was so catastrophic – and it still is. “Maybe it’s a physiological thing that I don’t understand, but when I talk about it I can still feel that emotion asit was yesterday and I still struggle to get over it. I know I speak for a lot of the lads who can’t have this conversation, but something broke inside me.”Those who knew the men who died most keenly feel the sadness of . For Seamus, the death of his friend Thomas McElwee, who he knew from H, was most dficult of all, and one that he finds most painful to speak about. He talks about his friend fondly, and will no doubt do so as he tells his own chapter in the dramatic account of the blanket men. “You are trying to bring people into that world and a lot of the lads can’t talk about it – most of them don’t,” he said.“For me, you don’t just talk about the protest, you actually relive it. Once you open that Pandora’s box you don’t know what you’re letting out, so a lot of the lads keep it closed.“Today, with the rise of Sinn Féin, the republican movement is healthy. It is a direct result of the fight against criminalisation. We thought it would be a footnote in Irish history, but it became a pivotal moment. Of the ten men who died on hunger strike I knew six of them personally. It was such an intimate death for all of them that it’s dficult to talk about.”Seamus will give his talk about le on the blanket in St Galls GAC this Friday evening, March , at .pm. All are welcome to come along."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"trade unionist movement launch in belfast","story":"A NEW trade union movement say unionist workers must be heard in the debate on ending Irish partition.Trade Unionists for a New and United Irelandcomprises more than  trade union officials, including a number of general secretaries.Having unveiled the movement in Dublin on Monday, the group held their launch in the north on Tuesday morning at Belfast’s Linen Hall Library.TUNUI want to advocate for reunication and convince the trade unions in Ireland to adopt a pro-unity stance.Spokesman Ruairi Creaney, from the Communication Workers Union, said that a conference being organised by TUNUI in Dublin in April would devote part of the programme to addressing unionist concerns.“I don’t think the unionist working class are as afraid of this issue as the media and others make it out to be,” he said.“It is patronising and dismissive of our unionist brothers and sisters. I think they will be up for the debate. This is about their future as much as it is about ours.”Sinn Féin National Chairperson Declan Kearney MLA welcomed the launch of the initiative.#In October  I spoke at an event organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions where I made a direct appeal to the Labour movement to engage in the discussion on Irish Unity and to put it#s mark on this debate,” he said.#In the intervening months, the focus on reunicationhas intensied with more and more citizens engaging in conversations about future constitutional change in our country.#At the end of January this year,  citizens packed the Waterfront Hall to engage in a conversation about the future of Ireland beyond Brexit.#That was another clear indication of the dynamic which now underpins the Irish unity debate.#It is crucial that any future constitutional change is influenced and shaped by the people, and that equality, social justice and citizens rights are at its core.#An opportunity is now opening up to reshape Ireland and Irish society for this and future generations.#The Labour movement in Ireland should be central to that process by asserting workers, citizens and democratic rights.#The Irish Congress of Trade Unions should bring the full weight of its resources and influence to this debate.#The Labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by asserting the primacy of economic democracy, and a rights-based society in a new Ireland.“That will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting calls for an Irish unity referendum, and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.“The Irish Labour movement should immediately set about introducing a progressive Labour agenda to the Irish unity debate, and to theunfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change. Labour should not wait.”"},{"url":null,"title":"duke and duchess are on the ball during visit to national stadium","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Broadcaster Strawbridge, who grew up in Co Antrim, is famous for his massive moustache.It also emerged that the PSNIs Unorm and Protective Measures Committee , which ratied the clean shaven policy - and subsequently amended it to broaden its scope - was not given \"key\" information.A PSNI chief health and safety officer confirmed that expert guidance from bodies including the Health and Safety Executive permitted facial hair. \"I made that clear,\" Mr Orr said.But he could not explain why a Sergeant Murray, who is off on sick leave and has not addressed the tribunal, did not include the information in a briefing paper he provided to Superintendent Patricia Foy who chaired the UPMC.The witness also said details of \"y and protracted discussions on how to police beards\" were not shared with appropriate staff including the PSNI Equality Officer Lorraine McCurdy.Mr Orr said it was an \"unfortunate\" consequence that colleagues formulating the policy came to believe that \"clean shaven\" applied to all facial hair instead of the area touching the masks seal. \"Small beards, moustaches and goatees would not interfere with equipment,\" he added.Mr Downeys lawyer said it was clear from the manufacturers own guidance that any moustache likely to interfere with respiratory masks would \"need to be a belter\".Mr Orr agreed. He also disclosed that the manufacturer of the respiratory equipment actively promoted men growing moustaches for the fundraising initiative known as Movember.But it was the revelation that officers discussed a suitability template which exercised the claimants lawyer who questioned how specialist officers could be trusted to carry lethal weapons but not to trim their own beards.

Questions have now been raised over whether this will affect schemes in other EU countries.Mr Trimble said: \"That means every other European renewable energy scheme is unlawful. The department hasnt just brought down the house of cards in Northern Ireland in terms of investment, but all schemes across Europe.\"The EC was contacted, but had not responded at the time of going to press."},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein bid for transfer of mep seats to northern ireland criticised","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the amendment to the European Parliament Elections Act which will be debated in the Dail today is all but certain to be defeated.The Irish Government has previously received legal advice stating it would not be possible to have people in Northern Ireland vote in European elections after Brexit.Fianna Fails Darragh OBrien said attempting to create Ireland North is \"pretty crass\". \"Its just so cynical its not funny.

He was well-known and much-loved in this city’s dance music circles and there is no doubt that Derry ravers who cut their teeth on the dancefloors of the North West would have styled it out to his uplting house music. In the days when the Troubles were still raging, Protestants and Catholics started to come together having found a dferent kind of religion in dance music and Hurley’s pulpit was the DJ box.Chris took the ‘Barn’ in Kelly’s, Portrush, where a meagre  or  punters turned up for his first ‘Club Night’ and, within weeks, transformed it into a heaving success with , dance music lovers from Derry and all over the North turning up every week to make it an unbridled success.The Point Inn just over the border in Quigley’s Point, Donegal, was another club – a place of the stuff of legends for Derry ravers – where they went in their droves while Chris stood smiling at the decks.Derry DJs, promoters, those with fond memories of their raving youth and those who continued to enjoy Chris’ music over the years, shared their shock, disbelief and sadness following the news of his death on February .Charlie Dillon, also known as DJ Bill-X, believes it is only fitting that Derry’s dance music community, of which Chris was a huge part, should pay tribute to the man who has been hailed a ‘pioneer’ and ‘legend’ of the Irish dance music scene.“I met Chris in the early s, I had been working in Kelly’s nightclub when I was a student in Portrush,” he said.“Chris had only started doing nights in the famous Barn - within a few weeks he was catapulted into playing packed houses and bringing guest DJs from all over the UK. Chris was one of the reasons I started to DJ myself. He was a very modest and witty fella, but he knew his music inside and out and stuck to the type of music that he wanted to play, he DJed all over Ireland and the UK. A few years ago we were very lucky to get into guest DJ at our re-rub nights.“Chris was a true pioneer and was the godfather of house in Northern Ireland and his legacy will live on. My thoughts and prayers are with the Hurley family and his little daughter, Scarlett.”Derry DJ, Paul Moran, better known in music circles as DJ Paul P, described Chris as an ‘innovator’ and a ‘legend’.“I first met Chris in  when I clamoured over the DJ box in Kelly’s to ask him to be our guest DJ at new night we were starting in the Point Inn,” he said.“Thankfully he agreed and the rest as they say is history. Our paths crossed many times over the intervening years. I will always remember Chris as an innovator, a DJ of principal who would not compromise his musical style to please the masses.“Chris set the bar high for all others that would follow. He was a real gentleman and a legend of Irish dance music. He will be sorely missed and his legacy will live long in the hearts of the thousands of people who were lucky enough to attend Kellys in the early days of the rave - a magical time made by Chris Hurley.”“He was definitely at the forefront of a le changing movement - a movement that helped break down religious and sectarian barriers during the dark years of Northern Irelands Troubles.”Another of the city’s home-grown talents, DJ Darren McMenamin said Chris was an inspiration to him and set him on the path to do what he truly loves.“Although I was into dance house music around the late s early s, it wasn’t until  and my first visit to Kelly’s, witnessing one of Chris Hurley’s now legendary all night DJ sets, that I even considered the thought of being a DJ,” he said.“Up on the Decks, top off, , people eating out of the palm of his hand...hanging on every tune! Everyone focused on him. I was instantly drawn into the scene.“After going week in, week out, for a few months, the Point Inn opened on Sundays with Chris at the helm. I was there the first night and didn’t take long to be over chatting to Chris about music and some general trainspotting on my behalf.“He was always generous with his time and knowledge and a true inspiration for me and many like me. After a couple of years raving I then went on to become a DJ myself and anytime I ran into Chris he always had time for chat and always showed me a lot of respect.“In more recent years we spoke a lot through Facebook and he invited me along to play at his Barn -year reunions in Sandino’s which was a real honour.“He was a gentleman and a true pioneer of the dance music scene and will be sorely missed.”Stephen Porter from Derry-based dance organisation Jika Jika, said Chris had the ability to unite people through his music: “We were very shocked and saddened to hear the news about Chris illness.“I was lucky to have got to know Chris over the years and he was always an inspirational figure to me and someone I looked up to greatly. His passion for music was infectious and his mannerisms would make you feel at ease.“His legacy is that of someone that brought a war-torn country together through music and firmly established dance music in NI. Deepest sympathies to all Chris friends and family.”While Ann Harley, Proprietor of Sandino’s, said: “Chris ran our Saturday nights for almost a year in . I had missed the Kelly’s Barn years, so didn’t realise at the time how well known and respected he was.“He put  per cent into every night he ran for us ,best DJs, classy posters and flyers, great attention to detail. Apart from that, from the start, he just fitted in and became a friend to a lot of us. Can’t believe we won’t see him again, as everyone says, a proper gentleman.

Not least from Chris’ dear friends.Mark Mc Dermott from Dungiven said he was honoured to have been his close friend: “To me, Chris Hurley was the epitome of a gentleman, kindness, the most great friend, and musician. Also the epitome of class but so humble at the same time. To know him well was a true honour. He was such an inspiration to me in all angles of le and he helped me in more ways than he will ever know. “Chris had talent to burn as a DJ from such a young age and was a pioneer in music, the first to create the house music dance scene in Ireland that will forever be remembered as the Love Years, aptly named as he not only bridged the religious ide at the time with music but he brought all the youth together. He was a living legend but his legend will forever live on in my heart, and the hearts of many.“Gone but never ever forgotten - the Godfather of House, but most importantly my dearest friend and brother in spirit.”Hector McLennan, a dance music promoter from Strabane who has passed the genes onto his own daughter, celebrated Ibiza club DJ, Loéca, paid a heartfelt tribute to ‘the Godfather of House’.“Chris Hurleys name is synonymous with the introduction, development and explosion of dance music in Ireland,” he said.“He has earned a permanent place in the history of our dance culture. He was Northern Irelands godfather of house. Im not saying that he was the only one, there were others who played their part, but he was definitely at the forefront of a le changing movement - a movement that helped break down religious and sectarian barriers during the dark years of Northern Irelands Troubles.“Chris had the tunes that every DJ wanted. Ive often been in situations with people in the music business and we would hear a tune. One of us would always say, \"That was a big Chris Hurley tune.\" Like DJs of his time, his message was spread through DJ Mix Tapes. What car didnt have a Chris Hurley tape back in the day “Over the last few years I enjoyed some great nights with Chris. We reminisced about the good old days and we hit it off because we were both excited about the current house music scene. Stand out moments include driving to Portrush after Sven Vath in Eglinton to hear Chris in Portrush with John Morrison on tow, a mad Paddys weekend in Portrush in  and of course having him as a guest in Sugar on a night co-promoted with Jika Jika. His love and passion for House Music had never faltered. He didnt want to re-live his success of the past but was still an innovator pushing out the barriers and seeking out those fresh new sounds.“I will always remember Chris for his love and passion for House Music. Chris Hurley, thank you for the memories.”\"He was erudite, intelligent and so so passionate about his music...he led from the front and was key to the start of the dance scene in Northern Ireland, a movement that would have a huge role in changing attitudes and lives.\"Neal McClelland, DJ and Presenter at Downtown Radio and Cool FM, also paid his respects recognising how powerful Chris’ music was in turbulent times: “Chris was an innovator and total gentleman that loved the groove and helped shape the wave of rave that swept across our country and created the bridge between two religions that paved the path for the future through music.”Darren Drake, DJ and good friend, said: “Chris was a devoted father, a loving son, brother and uncle. Ever since our first meeting, in those halcyon days of the house music revolution of the early s, of which he was a true pioneer, Chris Hurley has been, and forever shall be, my inspiration and my friend.”Ray McLaughlin, also known as DJ X-Ray: “Chris paved the way for a whole new generation of DJs some of us wouldnt still be DJing todayit wasnt for his vision in the early s.”Glen Molly said he wished Chris could have been there for the th anniversary of the Barn: “The  years of the Barn was missing him,” he said, “I would really have loved him to have played it.”Timmy Stewart, a DJ from Belfast and close friend to Chris, said: “I loved the fact Chris was so upfront with his music.“We had heard Secret Knowledge’s ‘Sugar Daddy’ played on the Essential Selection one Friday night and he played a white label of it the very next night. I always felt privileged to be exposed to that level of cutting edge music especially at that age and time.”Col Hamilton, Promoter at Lush! Official , paid this tribute on behalf of the club where Chris first burst onto the scene: “We were saddened to hear the news of the passing of original Kelly’s resident DJ Chris Hurley.“Back in early  when Kelly’s Barn was a live band and rock venue, the late James Kelly let a young local lad start a Saturday ‘Club Night’, the rest, as they say, is history. Chris Hurley started with about  people on the first night and within six months was attracting thousands of clubbers from across the North and Donegal flocking to hear the latest UK European house music. To say he started a legacy would be only fair and Lush! would not be here  years later as one of the UK’s leading venues without Chriss original vision.“We would like to take this opportunity to extend our condolences to His Family circle and his young daughter. Until we meet again, old friend.”Liverpool DJ, Steve Vertigo, said a phone call in  from Chris went on to ‘open the door on a magical Northern Irish adventure that has rumbled on for  years’.\"When I met him we shared similar hairand were both bang in the middle of an incredible love affair with house music,\" he said.\"That first night waiting in the Barn for it to open with hundreds of people outside banging on the walls chanting Let us in!” like some sort of fantastic zombie survival film was only a hint of the craziness to come. That first booking turned into a friendship and many repeat visits hanging out for days after gigs in Portrush with Chris and Joanne. He was erudite, intelligent and so so passionate about his music. Always ready with a laugh and a plan and an appetite for good old-fashioned fun. He led from the front and was key to the start of the dance scene in Northern Ireland, a movement that would have a huge role in changing attitudes and lives.\"In  I played one last time with him in the main room at Kelly’s, a reunion and a waypoint on a long journey that now feels so short. It brought back memories of beautul, messy hazy times in Portrush when we were all young and had no idea how big this dream of utopia would grow.\"Ill remember his smile and the way hed look you up and down, head tilted slightly back as hed work out whether you were talking rubbish and how he was going to wind you up. He was a romantic and a dreamer and the gods know we need more of those.\"My heartfelt sympathies to his loved ones, family and friends. He was one of the good ones. Rise in Power, Chris. Big Love.\"The Hurley family said that they have taken heart in the tremendous outpouring of love and sympathy since Chris’ death.In a statement they said: “We are finding it very hard to take in, we miss him so much - he was so special to each and every one of us.“As I said before Christopher was our hero what a fighter to the end - he always believed he was going to get better.“We as a family are so proud of what Christopher achieved through his music bringing everyone together. Tributes that have been made to Christopher are so special to us knowing how well he was thought of and showed us everyone thought the same as us...what a gentleman he was.”The late Chris was son to Joe and Margaret, loving father of Scarlett and the late Ava, brother of Joseph, Sharon and Rhonda, a loving brother-in-law and uncle and a legend in Irish dance music.PICTURED ABOVE: The late Chris Hurley whose passion for his music made him a favourite with dance music lovers in Derry and beyond."},{"url":null,"title":"dungiven schoolboy class act norths watched television programme","story":"When Cahir McGilligan was writing his Christmas list in , there was only one thing he really wanted from Santa that year – to feature on one of the North’s most popular television shows.The Dungiven boy was so eager to appear on UTV farm show ‘Rare Breed’ that he penned a letter to Santa and asked for his help.So when UTV producers contacted Cahir’s mum Nicole in April  to say they were interested in featuring the family on the show, the north Derry schoolboy was delighted. “I’ve always watched the show so I asked Santa in I could go on it. When they got in touch I was really excited,” said ten year-old Cahir, who has featured on the last three episodes of the programme alongside his dad Sean and grandad Harry.Cahir , who is probably one of the youngest to ever feature on the show, has been popular with viewers who have tuned into the new series, which began in January.Over the last few weeks, viewers have seen three generations of the McGilligan family busy at work on their farm outside Dungiven.In recent episodes they have been filmed lambing ewes, visiting the Balmoral Show and shearing a  strong flock of sheep during last summer’s hot spell of weather.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshCahir, who attends St John’s Primary School in Dernaflaw, said although he was ‘nervous’ about filming he was ‘really happy’ to be part of the show.“I’m excited to get home from school to watch the show on Thursday nights,” said Cahir, who has been farming every weekend with his dad and grandad since he was just four.“I want to be a farmer when I’m older. My favourite part about farming is looking after the animals and helping daddy and granda.”Last week’s episode of ‘Rare Breed - A Farming Year’ was once again the most watched programme in the North with over , viewers tuning in.Tonights episodewill see Cahir, who is an avid footballer and hurler with Dungiven clubs, St Canice’s and Kevin Lynch’s, and who also plays soccer with Dungiven Celtic, showing lambs for the first time in Omagh.Viewers will his hard work pay off both in the lamb class, and the young handlers class.Cahir’s dad Sean said: “The whole family is very proud of Cahir. It’s a great achievement for him.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sdlp candidate calls decisive action universal credit","story":"SDLP Ballyarnett election candidate, Rory Farrell has called on the British Government to take “decisive action to protect working families” in the wake of a High Court ruling against the controversial Universal Credit benefits system.Judges in London recently ruled that the Department of Work and Pensions Minister had ‘wrongly interpreted regulations when calculating Universal Credit payments and that this had disadvantaged working families.Mr Farrell said: “Working families in Derry are losing out due to fundamental flaws in the Universal Credit system. The method used to calculate payments is unfair, reliant on employers reporting wages on time and can lead to massive rental debts.“Universal Credit replaced a host of benefits including Working Tax Credit and Housing Benefit, and some families on the new benefit are beginning to witness its pitfalls. Working Tax Credit payments were based on expected earnings for the year, whereas Universal Credit payments are based on earnings reported to HMRC in the previous month.“Working in Colum Eastwood’s constituency office in Northside, we are contacted on a weekly basis by people receiving no Universal Credit payments due to inaccurate or late reporting of their wages to HMRC.“If wages are reported late then Universal Credit payments can be affected. It all comes down to the Assessment Period, the month long period preceding payment which is used to calculate entitlement to Universal Credit.“We’ve had countless incidents where employers have reported wages late which resulted in two monthly wages going into one Assessment Period, giving the impression of massive monthly earnings. This has led to no Universal Credit payment the following month.“The flip side is that there will then be a preceding Assessment Period with no wages reported which leads to an inflated Universal Credit payment. It all financially balances out over the two-month period but it makes it very dficult for families to budget.“But the critical and most worrying aspect is the impact on Housing Costs. Most people on Universal Credit get help with Housing Costs which goes directly to the landlord, the equivalent of the old Housing Benefit system.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“In a month where no wages are reported they get an inflated Universal Credit payment with Housing Costs paid directly to the landlord. In a month where two wages are reported, they get no Universal Credit payment and the landlord receives no rent.“The Universal Credit payments balance out over two months but the landlord only receives one months rent, leaving the claimant in rent arrears.“One real le example is where a young Derry mother’s employer reported wages ten days late and she now owes her landlord nearly £ in rent. Had the wages been reported on time, she would owe her landlord nothing.“The sad reality is thatyour employer reports your wages late to HMRC that it could cost you a months rent.“We’ve asked Universal Credit to recalculate monthly payments and Housing Costs based on the dates employees were actually paid, but theyve said the system doesnt allow for this.“The system must change. Entitlement to Universal Credit must be calculated on actual monthly income, not calculated on when it was reported to HMRC.”“The SDLP voted against all aspects of Welfare Reform. Universal Credit is wreaking havoc on our society and it should be scrapped. In the absence of that, the British Government must take decisive action to make it fairer system for all.”CAPTION: SDLP candidate Rory Farrell."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wMlxcXC8yNjEzNTk1MFxcXC9Ccmlhbi1UaWVybmV5LW5ldy5wbmdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC9jYWNoZS5yZXNpemVkLmNvXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiJmYWRkYzFmMTA2YjIzOTQ1NzFhYjIzYjBjZGZlNjNlNzdhNDE3M2EwIn0=/brian-tierney-new.png","title":"tierney welcomes buncrana road upgrade public information day","story":"The Department of Infrastructure is to hold another public information day on the proposed A Buncrana Road dualling scheme.The news has been welcomed by SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshCllr Tierneysaid: “At a public meeting convened by the SDLP on th May , residents were able to air their concerns to engineers with regards to the proposed dualling of Buncrana Road and some of its impacts on the local community. “Officials from the Department and ARUP Consultants listened to concerns and undertook towith revised drawings aimed at addressing some of the issues raised.“We have continued to lobby with the Department for Infrastructure and are pleased that a date for another Public Information Day has been set for Tuesday th March, Da Vinci’s Hotel. “We are hopeful that residents’ concerns and suggestions will be reflected in the new plans.

We also run lots of arts and crafts, cookery and games-centred projects.ldquoAll we are looking for in a volunteer is someone who is dedicated to the aims and objectives of Glebe House and its projects.ldquoInthey will receive training in which ever area they choose to work, a lot of camaraderie and the opportunity to meet new friends.ldquoOne of the most rewarding aspects of working at Glebe House for me is seeing children we have helped come back as volunteers years later. We push volunteers in the right direction and they receive certicates from us to show perspective employers or universities.Anyone interested in volunteering at Glebe House can contact    or can email info@glebehouseni..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Jimmy’s 10k set to be bigger than ever  ","story":"DETAILS have been unveiled of this yearrsquos Jimmyrsquos k road race in Downpatrick on St Patrickrsquos Day.The popular event, organised by East Down AC and supported by MB McGrady  Co, Chartered Accountants, is set to hit the pavements in just three weeksrsquo time.The race is set to achieve its highest-ever participant numbers.

He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

Reading is fundamental to a broad range of subjects.“Children need to understand the exam paper they’re facing, whether that’s maths, science, or history.“It’s great to see that Scottish pupils are reading books with greater understanding. However, they still have some way to gothey’re going to climb up the international rankings.“This study shows that reading motivation, appropriate reading challenge and reading practice is the key to literacy success.“We have to make sure that children are both challenged and charmed by the books they read.”Reading for pleasure was a key finding of the report which indicated pupils’ favourite books were read with better comprehension, even when considered to be of greater dficulty.The report also found JK Rowling continues to dominate primary school children’s favourite book choices, with her seven Harry Potter novels taking the top seven spots.Other authors enjoyed by young people in the last academic year include Jeff Kinney , David Walliams and Roald Dahl.Upskirt pictures of teachers ‘a wrong, horrible thing to do’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Professor Keith Topping from the university said: “This report gets under the skin of children’s reading habits in the UK, and the results are eye-opening. It’s great to see that Scottish pupils are at the top of the table in reading comprehension.“We can now see that balancing the three factors of appropriate reading challenge, reading practice, and reading motivation is fundamental for children’s reading progress.“Although important, instilling reading culture in schools isn’t just about dedicated reading time.“Teachers and librarians should also encourage lively classroom discussion about fiction, with children sharing favourite authors and titles.“They should also be on hand to advise on books with appropriate challenge bespoke to the child’s interests.“And of course, it is important to encourage children to read outside of school, so letting them take books home is crucial.”try catch  TrendingSevere weather warning issued for N.I. - travel disruption expectedNolan Show caller: lsquoSomeone may blow your f***ing brains outrsquoRoyal Visit round-up: The Duke  Duchess of Cambridge in Northern IrelandNew documentary marks th anniversary of Tom Herrons deathLatest pictures: Kate and William visit home of Northern Ireland football          ..

It is for the state to decide, in light of the incapacity of de Silva’s review and the inquiries which preceded it to meet the procedural requirement of article Two, what form of investigation,indeed any is now feasible, is required in order to meet that requirement”.Given the way that the court’s assessment of Article Two has been seized on immediately by activists and politicians to demand a Finucane inquiry, the government has a duty to outline why no such investigation is now feasible or required.Britain must challenge the proportionality of meeting the most rigorous interpretations of Article Two, decades later, in deaths which often happened in the early days of a terror campaign to which the state was scrambling to respond. A vast amount of public cash has now been spent on one murder, that of Mr Finucane, and millions more might yet be spent on inquests into historic killings by state forces. But as our report on page  from a packed event in Newry this week shows, there is deep well of unresolved terror cases that also need a scrutiny they have not had . We have repeatedly heard in recent years that these legacy inquests must be funded, without any explanation as to why they must be mini inquiries. Perhaps the Supreme Court judgement will now be used to justy that approach, butso ministers must respond that due to finite funds and a need for overall balance they cannot accept such an assessment.My aunt and uncle were not killed in a war, they were murdered in the IRA campaign of sectarian hatred in Fermanagh Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingSevere weather warning issued for N.I. - travel disruption expectedNolan Show caller: lsquoSomeone may blow your f***ing brains outrsquoRoyal Visit round-up: The Duke  Duchess of Cambridge in Northern IrelandNew documentary marks th anniversary of Tom Herrons deathLatest pictures: Kate and William visit home of Northern Ireland football          ..

It then took three painstaking days to place each pie into the perfect position. Cocoa powder, currants, sesame seeds and brown sugar were used for the outlining. Other little nods such as some shamrocks are hidden in the detailing on top of some of the pie lids. Holly Bouldin from Jus-Rol saID:“Founded back in  by Jus-Rol, British Pie Week aims to inspire the nation to celebrate one of the greatest British classic foods and we wanted to pay tribute to that love by creating an impressive image which reflects Northern Ireland.”  Inspired by the image, Jus-Rol have launched a contest to pit the country’s regions against each other to create the best new pie that bakes in the iconic flavours and ingredients of the area.When asked for their favourite pie filling, the people of Northern Ireland showed they have a sweet tooth, declaring Apple Pie as their ultimate favourite. Tying as joint favourites for second place are Beef Mince and Chicken and Ham pies. And it is back to a sweet pie for third place with Lemon Meringue.To enter the contest, send an image and the recipe inspired by the flavours of Northern Ireland to www.jusrol britishpieweek for a chance to win £,.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

The Caernarfon by-pass cost could spiral from the original pound. million to pound. million.\"Work towards a positive outcome is further forward than at any time since it was first mooted over  years ago.\"There are a number of other steps still to be taken before the cabinet will eventually decide which by-pass route option and other measures should be surveyed and designed in detail in stage .The council has promised a public consultation of the proposals in the future, giving everyone the opportunity to discuss and comment on the project with officials and consultants. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The report considers the particular challenges for sectors reliant on non-UK workers who earn less than the proposed pound, threshold ndash such as accommodation and food services, manufacturing, and social care.ldquoIt also considers the particular challenges for rural and remote communities, which are especially reliant on in-migration to sustain economic livelihoods and public services ndash but which will be most affected by the proposed salary threshold.ldquoThe proposed transitional arrangements for short-term migration are also likely to lead to higher churn and integration challenges in local communities.ldquoWe also find that the proposed changes would have gender impacts, potentially leading to a lower proportion of female migrants.ldquoWe suggest that discussion on the UKrsquos future immigration system needs to be underpinned by more comprehensive analysis on the range of effects, across dferent sectors, local areas, and by gender.Andrew McRae, FSB Scotland, said: ldquoThis thorough report details the real impact that current immigration proposals could have on local communities, economies and businesses.ldquoIt chimes with feedback from our membership and reinforces the case for an alternative approach to be developed.ldquoFewer working age people in Scotland will make it more dficult to run a business, especially in rural areas and in a number of key sectors.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingCall for fly-tipping in Obins St to stoplsquoOnly a matter of time before someone is killed at Ardress crossroadsrsquoRoyal couple, Kate and William delight crowds at Belfasts Empire Music Hall during NI visitFirefighters cut two casualties out of vehicles after morning crashTribute to crash victim Patrycja: lsquoAn out-going little girl with the most beautul smilersquo          ..

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
